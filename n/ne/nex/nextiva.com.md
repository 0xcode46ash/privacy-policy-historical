1. Information - We may collect different types of personal and other information based on your
use of our products and services and our business relationship with you, including contact
information; billing information, equipment, performance, Nextiva’s website usage, viewing and
other technical information about your use of our network, services, products or websites.

                                                                                       © 2014 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


agencies. Our goal of collecting your information is to provide you with the best customer
experience possible by (800) 983-4289 Nextiva.com communicating with you regarding service
updates, offers and promotions; delivering advertising that may be of interest to you; addressing
network and security issues; investigating or taking action regarding illegal activities or violations
of our Terms of Service or Acceptable Use Policies.
We collect some information on an anonymous basis and may anonymize the personal information
we collect about you into data groups. When we employ non-Nextiva companies to anonymize or
aggregate data on our behalf, the requirements for sharing Personal Information with
non-companies apply. We may share aggregate or anonymous information in various formats with
trusted non-Nextiva entities, with whom we have contracted with to aggregate such data and may
work with those entities to do research and provide products and services. When Nextiva jointly
provides a service with a non- Nextiva company, your Personal Information may be subject to both
this Policy and the privacy policy of the non- Nextiva company. We encourage you to review the
privacy policies of any non- Nextiva company with which you do business to determine what
information will be collected and how it will be used or disclosed to others.
2. Disclosure - We do not sell your Personal Information to anyone for any purpose, and we
maintain information about you in our business records while you are a customer, or until it is no
longer needed for business, tax, or legal purposes. We have implemented encryption or other
appropriate security controls to protect Personal Information when stored or transmitted by
Nextiva.
Subject to applicable legal restrictions, such as those that exist for Customer Proprietary Network
Information (CPNI), the Nextiva family of companies may share your Personal Information with
each other to make sure your experience is as seamless as possible, and you have the full benefit of
what Nextiva and its subsidiaries have to offer. Customer Proprietary Network Information
(CPNI) is information that relates to the quantity, configuration, type, destination, location and
amount of use of the telecommunications services you purchase from us, as well as the
information contained in your bills for those services. We collect CPNI in the normal course of
providing you with telecommunications services. Your telephone number, name and address are
not CPNI.
We share your Personal Information only with non-Nextiva companies that perform services on
our behalf, and only as necessary for them to perform those services. We require those
non-Nextiva companies to protect any Personal Information they may receive in a manner
consistent with this policy, and we do not provide Personal Information to non-Nextiva companies
for the marketing of their own products and services without your consent. We may provide
Personal Information to non-Nextiva companies or other third parties for purposes such as
emergencies, pursuant to court orders, identity verification to prevent fraud and identity theft,
enforcing of property rights, or obtaining payment for products and services that appear on your
Nextiva billing statements. (800) 983-4289 Nextiva.com
                                                                                     © 2014 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


3. Privacy Controls - You can review and correct your Personal Information collected by us. You
can limit certain types of solicitation communications from Nextiva, including marketing contacts
made via telephone, e-mail and text messaging by notifying Nextiva. We will provide you with
notice of changes to this policy. We are happy to correct information found to be inaccurate.
Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.
4. Exclusions - Information that you provide to non-Nextiva companies is not covered by this
Policy. For example: When you download applications or make an online purchase from a
non-Nextiva company while using Nextiva’s services, the information collected by the
non-Nextiva company is not subject to this Policy. If you use public forums — such as social
networking services, Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms, or blogs on Nextiva or non-Nextiva
websites — you should be aware that any Personal Information you disclose publicly can be read,
collected, or used by others. Once you choose to reveal Personal Information on such a site, the
information is publicly available, and Nextiva cannot prevent distribution and use of that
information by other parties.
Nextiva may enter into written product or service agreements with business customers that
contain specific provisions related to the confidentiality, security or other handling of information.
When provisions of a written product or service agreement differ from or conflict with the
provisions of this Policy, the terms of the written agreement will apply. In all other instances, the
terms of this Policy apply.
5. Security - We have established electronic and administrative safeguards designed to secure the
information we collect, to prevent unauthorized access to or disclosure of that information and to
ensure it is used appropriately. Although we strive to keep your Personal Information secure, no
security measures are absolute, and we cannot guarantee that your Personal Information will
never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Policy (for example, as the result of
unauthorized acts by third parties that violate the law or this Policy). We will make reasonable
attempts to notify you if we determine that Nextiva has experienced a security breach and there is
a reasonably likely risk of identity theft, or where otherwise required by law.
6. Policies - We have established policies and practices to meet the expectations of Customers
and potential customers who have expressed a desire to limit certain types of solicitation
communications from Nextiva, including marketing contacts made via telephone, e-mail and text
messaging. You also can request to be removed from these telemarketing lists when you receive a
marketing or promotional call. Where required by state laws and/or regulations, we honor
requests from businesses to be removed from our telemarketing lists.
The FTC maintains a National Do Not Call Registry at https://www.donotcall.gov/, and your state
may maintain its own Do Not Call Registry. Putting your number on these Registries also may limit
our telemarketing calls to that number. (800) 983-4289 Nextiva.com
                                                                                     © 2014 NEXTIVA, ALL RIGHTS RESERVED


Our practices as described above are designed to satisfy state and federal legal requirements
limiting marketing contacts. You should know that those laws and regulations — such as the
requirements governing the state and federal "Do Not Call" lists — generally permit companies to
contact their own current and, in some cases, former customers, even when those customers are
listed on the federal and state "Do Not Call" lists. Similarly, restricting our use of your CPNI will
not eliminate all types of Nextiva marketing contacts.
7. Online Advertising - Nextiva works hard to detect and prevent junk e-mails (also referred to as
"spam" e-mails) from ever reaching your computer. However, if you are receiving unwanted spam
from a Nextiva e-mail address, please contact us for assistance at marketing@nextiva.com.
8. Account Set-Up - When selecting User names and passwords for Nextiva accounts, you should
choose words or characters that are not obvious. Likewise, you should always keep Personal
Information such as account numbers, Usernames, passwords or similar information in a secure
place and not share the information with others.
9. Policy Changes - Information about our Customers and Users, including Personal Information,
may be transferred as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of
service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of an insolvency, bankruptcy, or
receivership in which Customer and User records would be transferred to another entity as a
result of such a proceeding. We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy as necessary to
reflect any changes we make and to satisfy legal requirements. If we make a material change to this
Policy, we will post a prominent notice of the change on our websites, and provide you with other
appropriate notice and choice regarding the use of your information, at least 30 days before the
effective date.
Please check our websites periodically for changes to this Privacy Policy.
We are happy to address any questions or concerns you may have about our privacy practices and
policies. You may e-mail us at marketing@nextiva.com or write to us at 8800 E. Chaparral Road,
