Also known as Web Beacons or Web Bugs, these tiny graphics inform us if a web page, an email, a banner ad, or other marketing campaign was viewed, opened, or accessed. They help us evaluate what content and campaigns are effective, and help us to manage our content to better serve your needs.

### **Data Security**

We believe that your personal information should remain just that, Personal Information, by providing secure transmission and storing of your information. We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our website and web server. This ensures that your personal information (i.e. name, address, etc) is not intercepted. Our services offer all personal data transmission through HTTPS, a secure Internet communications protocol. Our security certificate is issued by RSA Data Security, Inc. and held by VeriSign, Inc. You may view information about our certificate, from your browser, when you are on a secure page, by selecting "Properties" under the File menu in Internet Explorer, or by selecting "Page Info" under the View menu in Netscape. 

When we transfer and receive certain types of sensitive information such as financial or insurance information, we redirect visitors to a secure server and will notify visitors through a pop-up screen on our website. 

Since only our web server holds the key, we are the only people who will be able to decrypt your information. Your information is then stored on a server that is separated from the Internet so that no one outside our office can retrieve your information. 

We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information, which we have collected from you at our site, under our control. 

### **Changes to this Privacy Policy Statement**

We may amend this policy from time to time and we may use visitor information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in this privacy policy statement. If our information practices change at some time in the future or if we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will post the policy changes prominently to our website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt-out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our website periodically.
