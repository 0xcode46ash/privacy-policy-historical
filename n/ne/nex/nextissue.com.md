# Privacy Policy - Next Issue

Next Issue Media LLC (“Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared. Please read the following Privacy Policy to learn more about our privacy practices. By visiting any of the websites operated by the Company and any sub-domains thereof, whether accessed online, via mobile, as an application, or any other format or method of distribution (collectively, the “Site”), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?

This Privacy Policy covers Company’s treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information about you and your computer or device that Company gathers when you are accessing the Site. Also, this Policy covers Company’s treatment of any Personal Information that Company acquires from the publishers whose publications are offered for sale on the Site (“Participating Publishers”). This Policy does not apply to information collected elsewhere, including without limitation offline and on sites, applications, destinations, or services linked to from the Site, or to the practices of third parties that Company does not own or control, or to individuals that Company does not employ or manage.

### What Personal Information Does Company Collect?

The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our users.

#### Personal Information You Provide to Us:

We receive and store any information you enter on the Site. The types of Personal Information collected includes e-mail address, name, phone number, billing information and shipping address. We may ask for additional information such as age, gender, hobbies and interests. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. Of course, if you wish to engage in a purchase on the Site, you will have to provide us with the required information to fulfill the purchase. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.

#### Information Collected Automatically:

  * We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Site. Company automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, the name and identity of your computer, mobile device and other devices, your operating system, browser type and version, CPU speed, connection speed, local information based on IP address, and, with your consent, as derived from GPS or similar features on your mobile device and other devices,..
  * Generally, the Site automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of user visits to the Site and its components, which titles are accessed through the Site, and the length and time a user may spend reading those titles similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show and how long they watched. Company may use this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Site so that we can make the Site appealing to as many users as possible, and improve those services. We may also use information about your purchases and activities on the Site to present you with offers that we believe may be of interest. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our Participating Publishers and other third parties about how our users, collectively, use the Site. We share this type of statistical data so that our Participating Publishers and other third parties also understand how often people use their services and the Site, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal online experience.
  * We will also use usage information in order to ensure users adhere to our Terms of Use. For example, a user’s usage information will help us confirm that a user only downloads a periodical or other content available for download to a maximum of 5 devices or 10 times in total (regardless of the number of devices).
  * Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Company will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, and while you will not be able to engage in any transactions if we don’t know who you are, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.



#### E-mail Communications:

We often receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Company if your computer or device supports this type of program. We use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other communications from us, you may be able to opt out of Company’s marketing and promotional messaging by adjusting the settings in your account information. Until you terminate your account with us, you will not be able to opt-out of e-mails providing account related information such as billing, renewal or legal notices.

Personal Information From Other Sources:

For purposes such as improving personalization of our services, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.

Our Participating Publishers: We share Personal Information about you and data about your purchases and Site Usage with our Participating Publishers so that they may fulfill your purchase.

In other situations, we provide services, or sell products jointly with, such Merchants. We will share user information that is related to your transactions with the applicable Merchants. For example, we may allow Merchants to choose the demographic information of users who will see their advertisements and/or promotional offers, and we may provide information we have collected from you to a Merchant in non-personally-identifiable form, in order for that Merchant to select the appropriate audience for its advertisements and/or offers.

Similarly, we may provide aggregate data we’ve collected about you to the Merchants that you may review on the Site so that those Merchants may provide you and their other users with an optimal experience, but we do not tell such Merchants who you are.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Company may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
