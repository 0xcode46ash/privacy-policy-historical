At NextStudent, your privacy is assured. We respect your right to privacy and recognize our obligation to keep information about you secure and confidential. We do not collect any nonpublic personal information about you unless you expressly authorize us to collect such information, such as when you submit a loan application to us. This information may include your name, address, telephone number, Social Security Number, and certain personal financial information such as student loan account balances, payment history, account usage and similar information relating to your transactions with NextStudent, and is used only to facilitate the performance of our services. We may share this information with other companies in the NextStudent family of companies, our servicers, originating agents, processing agents, and third party agents, to effectively and efficiently process or administer your loan. 

We do not collect individual information about visitors to our Web site, however, we do use standard software to collect combined, aggregate information for the strict purpose of analyzing this Web site's traffic and usage. This allows us to better understand how many people access our site and which pages are most popular. 

NextStudent abides by federal law and the guidelines established by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy. Therefore, we will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13.
