**Your Privacy**

At NextStudent, we are committed to respecting your privacy. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. You may always visit our site and browse without giving us any personal information. Please read on for more details about our privacy practices.

 **What information does NextStudent collect? How do we use it?**

At times we may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information. Generally this information is requested when you search for scholarships or apply for student loans. If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet, we intend to let you know how we will use such information. 

For scholarship search, the information you choose to provide is used to define your personal profile. The search tool uses your personal profile to find the scholarships that are most appropriate for you. Your personal information will **not** be sold or distributed _unless you request student loan information._

Should you have an interest in student loans and complete the loan pre-qualification section, a reputable and competitive student loan lender will contact you or your parents. You are in no way obligated to borrow from this lender by completing the loan section information. This is simply a time-saver in finding you an experienced and qualified student loan lender and to answer any questions you may have. 

We intend to continue improving the content and function of NextStudent.com. For this reason, we monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve the design and layout of our web site and provide content of interest to you.

 **We hope you enjoy using NextStudent.com!**
