Safeguarding your privacy is very important to us. We take seriously the collection of any personally identifiable information and personal contact information ("personal information") from our visitors and are committed to protecting each visitor's privacy in accordance with these policies. We use the term "visitors" to include both registered members of the News12 web site and any other person that accesses our web site at any point for any amount of time, unless designated otherwise. Please carefully review our information collection practices and privacy protections below.

**Who We Are And How To Reach Us**

This web site is operated by News 12 Interactive, Inc., "News 12", which owns the News 12 web site. News 12 is the only operator of this web site.

Attention: Newsroom Coordinator  
[news12li@news12.com](mailto:news12li@news12.com)**

**Membership and Participation Eligibility**

Parts of our web site may require that you be thirteen (13) years of age or older to participate and/or to be a member and receive membership benefits. To participate in contests, sweepstakes and/or special events, you must meet the designated minimum age requirements (for example, eighteen years of age or older) for the specific event. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement for additional information on membership and/or participation on our web site. 

**Collection of Personal Information**

We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this web site. To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes. For web site activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our web site activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policy or our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our membership database and to comply with various federal and state laws. 

**Registration for Participation in Web site Activities and Services**

**Use and Collection of Information by News 12**

To participate as a member of our general audience web site, or in special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive areas, you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender ("personal information").

Non-members may also participate in Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by News 12 after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password. Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by News 12 may require a different registration process.

We may also survey visitors about various topics, including their content preferences, their television viewing preferences and how we can improve our web site, programming and services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.

We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to recognize our registered users, protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and web site, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in interactive areas and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service, web site or various events.

We may also offer an email a link feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a link to another person to inform them about News 12 activities. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on email links.

The only personal information this web site obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you. This web site does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. This means that a person can visit our web site and navigate through the site without giving us personal information. To gauge the effectiveness of our web site, we may collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the webpage from which a person enters our site, webpages visited, duration of visit and domain type. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.

Our contests, sweepstakes and special events may be produced with the support of non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our web site in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by News 12 and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the web site applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions.

**Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers**

For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this web site. Companies other than News 12, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "operational providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us.

In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in News 12's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with News 12, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested order. However, you must read an operational providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online.

News 12, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor is the News 12 family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by operational providers.

**Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices**

This site uses cookies or other tracking devices. A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a web site places on your hard drive when you visit a site. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site. Cookies do not allow the web site to access personal information that you haven't already provided. Cookies enable us to track the number of contest and promotion entries, how often visitors are visiting our web site and specific pages, estimate the audience size for sponsors and advertisers, and to track user preferences. You can refuse to use cookies by turning them off in your browser. Please contact your software manufacturer for questions on how to disable your cookies. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site. However, you may find that some areas on the web site will be slower, or may not function at all, and you may not be able to participate in certain activities such as contests or sweepstakes if the cookies are disabled.

Websites of operational providers may use clear GIFs to track non-personal or personal information. A clear GIF is a tiny line of code only 1 by 1 pixel in size that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website, such as how many visitors have accessed the site or to retrieve certain cookies and track visitor preferences. We may use clear GIFs to access certain cookies or to gather aggregate information about visitor usage patters; however, this does not include personal information about our visitors.

Other websites may use clear GIFs to track non-personal or personal information. News 12, its parents and subsidiaries are not responsible for the use of clear GIFs by other website operators. Visitor's must review other website operators' privacy policies to determine the type and extent of tracking devices use.

**Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors**

We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our site. This advertising company may collect and use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to our site and other web sites not owned and operated by News 12, and may also combine this information with other data about your purchases and interests from other online and offline sources, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. In addition, we may share non-personal web site usage information about visitors to this site with this company for the purpose of managing and targeting advertisements and for market research analysis on our site and other sites. For these purposes, News 12 and our third party advertising company may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of pixel tags (also called clear GIFs). In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer.

Our web site may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the web sites of advertisers or sponsors which are companies that are not owned or operated by News 12, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These advertisers, partners and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you visit an advertiser's, partner's or sponsor's web site you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that web site operator. News 12, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries, will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the web sites of advertisers and sponsors.

**Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties Other than News 12**

We only share or disclose your personal information with companies other than News 12 when it is required by law, disclosure is necessary to operate the web site or our web site services, and/or to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property, or disclosure is consistent with News 12's practices for services that are similarly provided offline.

News 12 is a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") and we may in the future share personal information with Cablevision, its affiliates or other entities for other purposes. If we decide to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose in this Privacy Policy the name of the entity(s) that we will share information with, what type of personal information will be shared, how the information will be used, and how to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out"). We currently conduct joint activities with members of the Cablevision family; however, we will not share individual visitors' personal information with these entities unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy. In the event of a sale or transfer of Cablevision assets, including its database, customer information may be transferred. Cablevision will require the recipient of this information to comply with Cablevision's privacy policy.

When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may share your personal information with our operational providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the web site, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this web site and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.

We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional and content partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

**How to Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information**

You will have access to your membership profile collected and maintained by our web site. You may add, change or delete personal information on your profile or registration for other activities by contacting us via e-mail at news12li@news12.com.

**Our Security Procedures**

We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our web site. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. If we decide to share visitor information with other members of the Cablevision family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our web site.

For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful web site links provided by other entities and/or persons. News 12, its parents and subsidiaries do not endorse or recommend, nor shall they be liable for, the products or services of any web sites not owned or operated by News 12. When you visit other web sites you will also be subject to the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that web site operator.

Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy

We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies, as News 12 deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis. 

**CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY**

  
News 12 respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We also offer parents and guardians additional guidelines to help keep your child's personal information safe and your family's Internet participation enjoyable. Please See Guidlines for Parents

Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our web site, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, user name and password from our records.

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law:

  * To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; 
  * To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; 
  * To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again; 
  * To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and 
  * To protect the security or integrity of the site, to take precautions against liability, to respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law. 



****Guidelines for Parents****

By taking responsibility for your children's online computer use, parents can greatly minimize any potential risks for being online. The best way to assure that your children are having positive online experiences is to stay in touch with what they are doing. One way to do this is to spend time with your children while they are online. Have them show you what they are doing and ask them to teach you how to access the services. 

While children and teenagers need a certain amount of privacy, they also need parental involvement and supervision in their daily lives. The same general parenting skills that apply to the "real world" also apply while online. 

Make it a family rule to: 

  * Never give out identifying information-home address, school name, or telephone number- in a public message such as chat or bulletin boards, and be sure you're dealing with someone that both you and your child know and trust before giving it out via email. Think carefully before revealing any personal information such as age, marital status, or financial information. Consider using a pseudonym or unlisting your child's name if your service allows it. 
  * Get to know the services your child uses. If you don't know how to log on, get your child to show you. Find out what types of information it offers, and whether there are ways for parents to block out objectionable material.
  * Never allow a child to arrange a face-to-face meeting with another computer user without parental permission. If a meeting is arranged, make the first one in a public spot, and be sure to accompany your child. 
  * Never respond to messages or bulletin board items that are suggestive, obscene, belligerent, threatening, or make you feel uncomfortable. Encourage your children to tell you if they encounter such messages. If you or your child receives a message that is harassing, of a sexual nature, or threatening, forward a copy of the message to your service provider and ask for their assistance. 
  * Should you become aware of the transmission, use, or viewing of child pornography while online, immediately report this to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children by calling 1-800-843-5678. You should also notify your online service.   
Remember that people online may not be who they seem. Because you can't see or even hear the person it would be easy for someone to misrepresent him-or herself. Thus, someone indicating that "she" is a "12 year-old girl" could in reality be a 40-year-old man. 
  * Remember that everything you read online may not be true. Any offer that's "too good to be true" probably is. Be very careful about any offers that involve your coming to a meeting or having someone visit your house. 



Set reasonable rules and guidelines for computer use by your children. Discuss these rules and post them near the computer as a reminder. Remember to monitor their compliance with these rules, especially when it comes to the amount of time your children spend on the computer. A child or teenager's excessive use of online services or bulletin boards, especially late at night, may be a clue that there is a potential problem. Remember that personal computers and online services should not be used as electronic babysitters. Be sure to make this a family activity. Consider keeping the computer in a family room rather than the child's bedroom. Get to know their "online friends" just as you get to know all of their other friends.

Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy.
