# News-Journal Online - Our history

|   Privacy statement  
---  
  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Because we gather certain types of information about users to this site, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.   
  Information that News-Journal Online gathers  
  
News-Journal Online gathers two types of information about users: 

1) Personal data, provided through voluntary registration on our forums.  
2) Aggregated data, which is collected invisibly. 

Personal data may be requested when you register for forums, contests, sweepstakes or other promotional programs offered on our Web site. We ask for this to provide you with the best Web experience possible. This information might include, for example, your name, e-mail address, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information or other information. Except as described below, it is not disclosed to parties other than the News-Journal Online in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission. 

Aggregated data, which tracks News-Journal Online activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis, is gathered through several methods. This tracking data follows Web site traffic in general, and is not used to identify you personally. 

Aggregated tracking information: Among the information we collect is the Internet provider of visitors; the computer operating systems of visitors; the browser used by visitors. Some national advertisers and content partners on our Web site may also collect this same data independently of News-Journal Online. This information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and how to tailor our site to the equipment and software used by visitors. We may disclose such aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and content partners.   
  
  Child Online Privacy Protection Act  
  
News-Journal Online will not knowingly allow any person under the age of 13 to provide personal information, or allow persons under 13 to access those features that require registration. If information is collected, parents can review and have deleted the child's personal information and refuse to permit further collection or use of the child's information. [Click here to make a request](http://www.news-journalonline.com/online/request.htm). For more information, contact the Webmaster at the address listed below.   
  How the News-Journal Online uses information  
  
News-Journal Online uses any personal information voluntarily given by you to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. 

This Web site will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to parties without your consent. There are exceptions: 

1) When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.  
2) When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to protect our rights. 

Whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online. 

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, what we do with information gathered, or if you need to change any information gathered from you, please e-mail [webmaster@news-jrnl.com](mailto:webmaster@news-jrnl.com) or write to News-Journal Online, 901 Sixth Street, Daytona Beach, FL 32117. You can also call 386-252-1511 X2595.
