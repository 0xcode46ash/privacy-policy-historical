For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to Newcritics include www.newcritics.com. The Newcritics website is a Blog site. By using the Newcritics website, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

**Collection of your Personal Information**

We do not collect personally identifiable information from our users. We may gather personal or non-personal information in the future.

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Newcritics. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Newcritics website.

Newcritics encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Newcritics so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Newcritics is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Newcritics website.

**Use of Cookies**

The Newcritics website may use “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Newcritics pages, or register with Newcritics site or services, a cookie helps Newcritics to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Newcritics website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Newcritics features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Newcritics services or websites you visit.
