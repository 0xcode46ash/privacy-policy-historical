Information is collected from our users at several different points during your use of our websites and online services.

 _Optional Information_ \--At various other points during your use of our websites and online services, you may be asked to provide information about yourself. For example, you may wish to participate in a survey or a contest. Participation in surveys or contests or the use of other services which require the input of additional information is completely voluntary on your part, and you have the choice about whether to disclose the information necessary to use these features of our site.

 _Passive Collection of Information_ \-- In addition to the information which you actively provide to BDX by methods such as completing the registration form, BDX collects information about how you interact with our websites or online services. BDX collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and the compilation of broad aggregate demographic data and related usage information for internal purposes and for disclosure to third parties such as advertisers and content partners. The types of passive information collected by our websites and online services include, without limitation, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site, and how long you stay on any part of our site. Passive information does not identify you to BDX by name, and BDX does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.

 _Collection of Information from Children_ \-- BDX abides by federal law and the guidelines set up by the Federal Trade Commission regarding youth privacy (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act). As such, BDX will not knowingly collect any personal information from or allow the registration of young people under the age of 13.

 _Tell-A-Friend_ \-- You can choose to let a friend or your parents know about BDX through our Tell-A-Friend referral services. If you choose to use the Tell-A-Friend service, we will ask you for your friend's name and e-mail address and BDX will send your friend an e-mail inviting him or her to visit BDX to learn more about our services. BDX stores your friend's contact information for the sole purpose of sending the e-mail.

In addition, as described above, BDX utilizes passive information to learn more about how you interact with our websites and online services.

This aggregate passive information does not contain any personal information which can identify any individual user.

Some information you provide (such as optional information or user-submitted content) may be distributed to our other websites and online services or to websites and online services of our affiliates or business partners. This could include survey responses, ratings and reviews (such as from the TrustBuilder program), comments, feedback or other user-submitted information that is publicly posted or where the context makes it apparent that it the information being shared by you is they type of information that is suitable for public display or distribution by us. Unless we specifically say otherwise, you agree that this type of information may be publicly displayed and is freely shareable by us.

The frequency of these messages will vary depending upon your profile. In addition, we may send you free informational newsletters or notices relating to topics which may be of special interest to you, including builders, product manufacturers, related advertisers and general home shopping advice. Finally, if you specifically provide BDX with permission at the time of registration, you may also receive commercial e-mails. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to opt-out of receiving newsletters and/or commercial e-mails whenever such messages are sent by BDX, as described below.

BDX will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy.

During the registration process, and at certain points thereafter in connection with specific offers, BDX asks you whether information about you may be sent to third parties who have products, services and opportunities which may be useful to you. BDX understands how important your information is to you. Therefore, BDX does not share any information that can be tied to you without your permission.
