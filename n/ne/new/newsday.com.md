# newsday.com | privacy policy

As newsday.com strives to offer its visitors as many advantages of Internet technology as possible, we are dedicated to protecting visitors from unexpected use of personally identifiable information.

How we collect and store information depends on the type of activity or benefit provided. For example, to receive customized television listings, you may enter the name of your cable TV system. That information is stored in a file on your computer so that you don't have to enter it each time you use the listings.

Wherever possible, we will inform you if information you enter may be used for a purpose you might not anticipate. For example, if we invite you to enter a contest and ask for your e-mail address, we will inform you if that address may be used to send you future mailings.

As part of our effort to offer customized services, newsday.com may use information about visitors' preferences to direct advertising appropriately. This information is used in aggregate form. Its purpose is to serve groups of visitors, not to track the activity of individuals. Personally identifiable information collected by newsday.com will not be shared with unrelated third parties in the absence of notice.

Affiliated and Linked Sites  


newsday.com hopes its partners, advertisers and affiliates will respect the privacy of our visitors.

newsday.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-branded, affiliated or linked sites. While on our site, you may occasionally receive "cookies" -- information inserted into the cookies.txt file stored in your computer -- from those who advertise on our site. The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. newsday.com does not control the use of these cookies or the resulting information; therefore, these cookies are not subject to newsday.com's privacy policy.  
Please note that if you post personal information on the message boards of newsday.com's public forums, that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.
