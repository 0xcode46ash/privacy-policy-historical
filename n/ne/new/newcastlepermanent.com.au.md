# Privacy Statement - Newcastle Permanent Building Society

## Our commitment to maintaining your privacy

We understand how important the privacy of your information is to you and we are committed to ensuring the confidentiality of your personal information. 

This Privacy Policy explains how we manage and protect your personal information. 

### Collection

We collect most personal information directly from you. For example, we may collect personal information when you open an account, fill in an application form, deal with us over the telephone, send us a letter, visit our website or when you have contact with us in person. 

The types of personal information we collect and hold will depend on the particular products and services you request from us. The personal information we collect includes your name, contact details (eg telephone number, email, postal and residential address), tax file number, date of birth and transactional information about the use of the product or service. Where relevant (for example, in the case of a loan application), we will also collect and hold information about your financial position, place of work, credit history and transaction history. In certain circumstances, we may collect sensitive information such as health details. 

There may be occasions when we need to source personal information about you from a third party. For example, we may collect personal information from a credit reporting agency or an insurer of your mortgage (but only if you authorise us to do so). 

#### Collection on our website

The only personal information which we collect about you when you use our website is what you tell us about yourself, for example, by completing an online form such as a loan application or by sending us an email. 

When you visit our website, our server may attach a small data file known as a "cookie" to your hard drive. A cookie allows the website to identify and interact more effectively with your computer. 

When you use our website, we send you a unique identification number. A different identification number is sent each time you use our website. The Society does not identify individual users, although we can identify your browser type and your Internet Service Provider (ISP). To evaluate the effectiveness of our website, we may collect statistical data. No personal data will be collected on these occasions. 

You can set your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is sent. If you set your browser so that it does not receive cookies, some of the functionality of this and other sites will be lost. In particular, the use of online services creates the need for us to be able to identify the member and cookies are used for this purpose. If you disable them the service will not recognise you. 

### Use

We collect and use your personal information for the primary purpose of: 

  * opening an account for you 
  * assessing an application by you for a product or service
  * providing you with the product or service that you have requested.



We may use or disclose your personal information for purposes related to the main purpose for which we collect it, such as: 

  * administering, monitoring, evaluating and managing the product or service you have with us; 
  * internal accounting and administration; 
  * providing you with information about other products and services offered by us or a related company of the Society; 
  * complying with the regulatory requirements; 
  * managing our relationship with you; 
  * protecting you and the Society from error or fraud. 



We may disclose your personal information to a related company of the Society, but it will still remain confidential. This will allow them to tell you about products and services offered by them that may be of interest to you. 

We may also disclose your personal information when we contract out some of our functions to external service providers who conduct specific activities for us such as mail outs. However, the information remains the property of the Society and the external service provider will be subject to strict confidential and nondisclosure obligations. 

You may opt out of receiving direct marketing information from us, simply by calling 13 19 87.

### Disclosure

We may disclose your personal information if, for example: 

  * you have given us your express or implied consent to disclose the information
  * the disclosure is required by law (such as, under a Court order or subpoena or a law that allows a Government agency, such as the Australian Taxation Office to demand that we disclose information about your account) 
  * the disclosure is permitted or authorised by law (such as, under the Privacy Act 1988) 
  * we need to protect our interest (such as in legal proceedings to which we are a party) 
  * the disclosure is required in the public interest (such as, where a crime or fraud has been committed). 



We will not disclose names and addresses to third parties for the purpose of enabling them to direct market their products and services to you. 

### Access to personal information

You can ask us to provide you with access to the personal information we hold about you. If we are able to, we will provide you with access. A fee may apply to such access. 

In some cases, we are entitled under the National Privacy Principles to refuse to give you access to your personal information. This includes circumstances where giving you access would prejudice negotiations we are having with you, prejudice investigations of unlawful activity or prejudice activities carried out by or for a law enforcement agency. If we deny your request for access, we will let you know why. 

If you would like access to your personal information, please contact: 

Head of Compliance   
Newcastle Permanent Building Society Limited

Phone: 13 19 87   
Email: enquiries@newcastlepermanent.com.au 

### Security

We will take reasonable precautions and security measures to keep your personal information secure and protect it from loss, misuse and from unauthorised access, modification and disclosure. 

### Updating your personal information

If we have accurate personal information about you, it enables us to provide the best possible service. 

We take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date whenever we collect or use it. 

If you find that current personal information we hold about you is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us immediately and we will correct it. If we disagree with you about the accuracy, completeness or currency of a record of your personal information held by us, we would, if you request us to do so, take reasonable steps to add to that record a statement that you claim this to be the case. 

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, but will remain bound by any legislative requirements. We will notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy by updating our website.
