**For Web Visitors**

Yankee Publishing Inc. respects your right to privacy. 

We use the information you supply us in different ways. We use your survey responses and feedback e-mail to help us improve the content and experience offered to our Web users. And we use your contact information to interact with you (if that was your intention). 

We invite your online comments to the articles we post on our Web site, and reserve the right to remove any comment at the discretion of the editors.

We will save your contact information to occasionally update you on new offerings about our Web site. If you sign up for our newsletter we will add your name to the subscription list for our e-mail newsletter, which we send out bi-weekly. You can remove your name from this list by following the instructions in the newsletter text. 

We use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and for internal reporting. If you are visiting our store, we also use cookies to maintain your order in our shopping cart. 

For information you provide to us, we will not rent or share your contact information outside of Yankee Publishing Inc. without your permission -- with two exceptions: when you enter a sweepstakes on our Web site we offer it to the establishment(s) that provides the sweepstakes prize; and if you subscribe to YANKEE Magazine the information you provide follows the guidelines listed below in "Print Subscribers Privacy Policy." 

Yankee Publishing Inc. is composed of different operating groups. Any information we save about you will be shared among these operating groups. Occasionally you may receive offers from these operating groups, to remove your name from those lists, follow the instructions within the communication. 

Some of the ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you on this site.

Yankee Publishing is currently contracted with Tacoda, Inc., a third party, to track and analyze anonymous usage and browsing patterns of our visitors and customers. All data collected by Tacoda on behalf of our Web sites is owned by Yankee Publishing. This information is used to help provide advertisers with more targeted advertising opportunities, which means that our users see advertising that is most likely to interest them, and advertisers send their messages to people who are most likely to be receptive, improving both the viewer's experience and the effectiveness of the ads. For more information about Tacoda's privacy policy, including how to opt out, go to [www.tacoda.com/notice](http://www.tacoda.com/notice).

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

**Print Subscribers Privacy Policy**

We occasionally make our subscriber mailing list available to mailers whose offers we think may be of interest to our readers. If you would prefer not to receive such offers, please send a request asking us not to release your name to third parties. When making your request in writing, include your address label if possible. Please note that it can take up to 12 weeks for your request to take full effect.
