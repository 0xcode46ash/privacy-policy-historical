# Security | New Look UK

**Stay Web Safe! Change your New Look password regularly on the account section of our website and avoid using the same password as your online accounts with other companies.**

If you’ve got any questions, comments and requests about your account security, then please use the [Contact Us](http://www.newlook.com/uk/help/contact-us#/Top) form.

If you’ve got any questions, comments and requests about your account security, then please use the [Contact Us](http://www.newlook.com/uk/help/contact-us#/Top) form.

For your security, any new password you create with us has to be at least 7 characters and contain a mix of letters and numbers. However, we recommend that you set a password of at least 10 characters including capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. 

To access your stored data on our sites, you’ll need to sign in with your username and password. It’s your responsibility to keep these details secret and to ensure you don’t let anyone else use your account. If you have any concerns about your sign in details or think they’ve been misused, please contact us straight away and we can put your account on hold immediately. 

From time to time, we may make services provided by third parties available through our sites. To use these services, you must register with these third parties and deal with them direct. We have no control over the content of those third party sites or the performance of these services. Please note, that you use these services at your own risk and that we can't accept any responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. Please check third parties privacy policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.
