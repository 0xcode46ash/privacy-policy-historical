Passwords created before this date will continue to work as normal.  
Close

                * ### How secure is my payment?

We're working with Visa and MasterCard to make shopping online with a credit card even safer, and to help protect your card against unauthorised use, just like Chip and Pin does. If your bank or card issuer is already part of this scheme, you may have already seen the Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode page when shopping online. If your bank hasn't yet introduced these measures, here's what you need to know: \- Shop online with added security and peace of mind \- Your password will be linked to your card, not your computer \- This will help prevent unauthorised purchases. How it works: When you reach the checkout at newlook.com (or any other participating store), you can register for Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. Just sign up using the on-screen prompts, create a password, and continue shopping. You only have to sign up once, and can then use your password for any future online purchases. Alternatively, you can contact your bank directly for more information. Please note that if you choose not to register during your order today, we may need to ask you for an alternative payment method to complete your purchase.

Close

                * ### Your rights

You have the right to ask us not to process your personal data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your data) if we intend to use your data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your data. You can also exercise the right at any time by contacting us via the contact form.

Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the websites of our partner networks, advertisers and affiliates.
