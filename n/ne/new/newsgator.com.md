##### The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use your email address to answer the email we receive and to communicate with you regarding your purchases. We may also use your email information to solicit feedback from you or alert you to new features in our products that we think may be of interest. You will always have the option to opt out of such communications. Your email address and other contact information are not used for any other purpose. We may utilize an external service for sending and tracking email communications and unsubscribe requests. These third parties may not share or use your email address for any other purpose.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers and content partners. For example, we may tell a partner company that X number of individuals subscribe to a certain content feed and may provide aggregate demographic information about these X individuals, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

We collect information on viewing and interacting with content to produce relevance ranking on articles. Personally identifiable information is not displayed or shared outside of NewsGatorâ€™s systems without your explicit permission (for example if you choose to make a clipping folder public).

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
