# Gravity App Privacy Policy | Newton Software

## Overview

We are Gravity Technologies, Inc., a California corporation, doing business as Newton Software (“Newton”), the owner and operator of the job-sharing application called the Gravity App (the “Application”) (found at [thegravityapp.com](http://thegravityapp.com/); the “Website”). The Application is used by people to share jobs on their socials networks. It is also used by employers to manage employee referral programs and to incent people to share jobs and generate applicants.

Newton respects your privacy and as a part of Newton’s mission to provide you effective Application services, Newton collects, stores and discloses information you provide on the Application under specific conditions. Your Personal Information (as defined in _Section 2.1_ ) is private and confidential, and subject to this Newton Gravity Privacy Policy (the “Policy”), meaning that such information will not be collected, stored or disclosed unless permitted under this Policy. This Policy describes what information Newton collects, how it is used and secured, and when and to whom it may be disclosed. Please take a few minutes to review this Policy.

## 1\. Consent

Your use of the Application is deemed to be your waiver and consent to this Policy and providing Newton and designated third-parties under this Agreement the right to collect, use and disclose your Personal Information (as defined in _Section 2.1_ ) subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not consent to the terms and conditions of this Policy, you should not use the Application.

## 2\. Personal Information

### 2.1 Covered Information.

Newton and designated third-parties under this Policy may collect, store and disclose the following forms of information you provide on the Application (collectively, the “Personal Information”): (a) e-mail addresses; (b) employer names; (c) Application sign-on information (i.e., your username and password); (d) device identification information; (e) preferred language and country information; (f) correspondence or communication sent via the Application; (g) job opening postings and candidate vouching information; (h) information on your interactions with Application features or other Application users; (i) jobs that you share to your social networks; and (j) other reasonably relevant information pertaining to your use of the Application including without limitation your Internet protocol addresses, standard web log information and content provided to Newton or their designated third-parties when contacted for assistance.

### 2.2 Your Informational Obligations.

Newton requires that you only submit information on the Application that is up-to-date and accurate, and that you inform Newton of any changes to such information. You must also assure that such information, whether provided on behalf of yourself or others, is correct and that you have the full authority and right to submit such information to the Application.

## 3\. Cookies

### 3.1 Assigning Cookies when signing in to the Application.

When you sign in through the Application, Newton will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours. It is your passport to seamlessly travel across the Application, allowing you to use the Application’s functionality with minimal subsequent registration procedures. Cookies are also used to record you as the source of any candidate or job referrals on the Application.

### 3.2 Assigning Cookies when applying to a job shared by the Application.

If you apply for a job opening that has been shared through the Application, Newton will assign you a unique identifier and send such information to your computer or device hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code will correlate your job application to the person that posted such job opening on the Application. It is uniquely yours and does not contain any of your Personal Information.

### 3.3 Disabling Cookies.

If you do not wish to have cookies on your devices, you may turn them off at anytime by modifying your Internet browser’s settings. However, by disabling cookies on your device, you may be prohibited from full use of Application’s features.

## 4\. Personal Profiles

### 4.1 Personal Profile Information.

Personal Profile Information. When you register on the Application, Newton uses a third-party provider, Janrain, Inc. ([http://janrain.com](http://janrain.com/); “Janrain”), to manage the Application login registration process and create a personal profile for you on the Application (“Personal Profile”) (If you have questions about Janrain’s security and privacy policies, please review Janrain’s [here](http://janrain.com/janrain-privacy-statement/)). Each Personal Profile is assigned a unique personal identification number and requires that you choose a username and password to access your Personal Profile on the Application, which helps Newton to ensure that only you can access your Personal Profile and Personal Information on the Application. Because you assist Newton in developing your Personal Profile username and password, you have a significant role in protecting your Personal Profile and Personal Information. No one can access or edit your Personal Profile without knowing your Personal Profile username and password, so do not share these with others.

### 4.2 Personal Choices.

If you want to review or update your first or last name, or e-mail address in your Personal Profile, you may do so on the Application.

### 4.3 Social Network Profiles.

When you post a job opening on the Application, Newton will request your permission to access your social networks including, without limitation, Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and LinkedIn so that you can share such job openings with your social network connections. Newton will not post any job openings or other content on your social networks, or amend any of your posted job openings or content without your authorization. The Application will also not track any of your social network activity, other than when you specifically use the Application to share job openings on your social networks.

### 4.4 Vouching Content.

Newton may ask you to vouch for people that have applied to job openings you have shared on the Application. Your employer’s Human Resources team will be responsible for determining who is allowed to view your responses to such vouching requests.

## 5\. Use of Personal Information

Newton uses your Personal Information to: (a) offer the Application’s services or conduct Newton’s business operations; (b) resolve disputes, or troubleshoot problems related to any services or products offered or provided through the Application; (c) encourage safe interactions between Application users; (d) enforce this Policy and others agreements associated with the Application or Website; (e) customize, measure and improve the Application and Website’s user experience; (f) contact you regarding the Application or your inquiries pertaining to the same; and (g) perform other related services for you as described in this Policy.

## 7\. Security and Storage of Your Personal Information

The security of your Personal Information is important to Newton. With the exception of Personal Profile login information stored by Janrain, as detailed under _Section 4.1_ , your Personal Information may be stored locally on your device and may be transmitted to servers owned, leased or utilized by Newton in the United States. Newton will only keep your Personal Information for as long as is either required to by law or as is relevant for the purposes for which it is collected. Newton employs generally accepted industry standards to protect your Personal Information. However, as the transmission of information over wireless and wired networks cannot be absolutely secure, Newton does not warrant or guarantee that your Personal Information will remain permanently secure.

## 8\. Third-Party Websites

The Application may contain links to third-party websites that are not owned or controlled by Newton. Newton has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, any share functionality, content, privacy policies or practices of any third-party website. When using such third-parties websites, you are subject to the terms and policies of those third-parties when and where applicable. By using the Application, you expressly relieve Newton from any and all liability arising from any share functionality or your use of any third-party website accessed from the Application. Newton encourages you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to any third-party website or service provider.
