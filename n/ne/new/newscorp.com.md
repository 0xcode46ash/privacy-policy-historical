# Privacy Policy

The News Corporation Limited ("News") recognizes the privacy concerns of visitors to its site on the Internet (www.newscorp.com). Personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's name, address or email address, is collected only when knowingly and voluntarily submitted to this site. For example, visitors to the investor relations areas of this site may voluntarily submit personal information in order to obtain information about News or its affiliated companies. Such personal information is used by News only to respond to these requests or to furnish these visitors with additional information about our Company. News does not transfer or sell visitors' personal information to third parties, except for the outside company we use to process and fulfill visitors' requests. However, this outside company is prohibited from using the information for a different purpose or transferring it to any third party. 

In addition to using information about you to respond to your specific requests, News may use it in aggregate, non-personal form to make our site better and more responsive to the needs of our visitors. 

News maintains reasonable and appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personally identifiable information submitted to this site. 

News collects certain non-personal information used only to optimize our web pages for your computer (i.e., the identity of your Internet browser, the type of operating system you use, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). We may also use non-personal information to determine the total number of visitors to our website.Â 

This site links to other sites operated by companies that are affiliated with News. Visitors to those sites should refer to the privacy policies or statements posted on each site to determine whether and how personal information is collected and used. 

News reviews its privacy policy periodically, and it may be subject to change.
