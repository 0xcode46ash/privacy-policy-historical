For example, it may be impracticable for us to transact with you for the purchase of product or the provision of other services if you have not identified yourself, or do so through the use of a pseudonym. 

We also collect Personal Information when you elect to submit such information to us when you register for "My Account", participate in a contest, event or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey, or contact us (for example via email).

## Sharing of Information

For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer your Personal Information to our third party service providers who use that information only to conduct New Balance business. For example, these third party service providers may handle New Balance credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, information analysis, and promotions management. We provide our preferred service providers with the Personal Information they need only to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your Personal Information. If you do not want New Balance to transmit your Personal Information to our third party service providers in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please follow the procedures described under the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below. 

We may use your Personal Information in the aggregate for purposes such as reporting and marketing. Such use of Personal Information in the aggregate is not personally identifiable.

We do not provide Personal Information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes. 

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy or with your prior consent, we will not use, sell, trade or rent Personal Information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it's possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your Personal Information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at that time. 

## Disclosure of Information outside Australia

New Balance may disclose your information outside Australia to members of the New Balance corporation or our service providers located in various other countries from time to time.

If we determine that it is not reasonably necessary for, or directly related to, one or more of our activities then we will either destroy, remove or de-identify the information as soon as practicable. 

If the Unsolicited Personal Information is supplied by a third party, then we will notify you of the collection of that information and the steps that have been taken in relation to that information.
