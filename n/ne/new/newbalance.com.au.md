# Privacy Policy

| New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. ("New Balance", "we" or "us") is respectful of the privacy concerns of the visitors to its web site. New Balance also recognizes the valuable potential of technology to help people communicate with the companies whose web sites they visit, particularly through customer databases. Responsible use of the information you share with New Balance is paramount. In order to help you understand the role technology plays in the collection and use of information you provide to New Balance, New Balance has created the following privacy policy and guidelines. By using this web site you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with any terms or practices described in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the New Balance web site.NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION  
In general, you can visit the New Balance web site and view its content while remaining anonymous by not providing any personal information.

New Balance will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (such as your name, address, telephone number or email address) unless you provide it to us voluntarily (for example, if you complete our on-line Club NB registration form). New Balance's purpose for gathering such information is to enhance your online experience by understanding you better and also to make you aware of new products or offers in which you may be interested. For example, New Balance may use such information to send you directed email with news and information on new content and features of the New Balance web site and new products and services offered by New Balance and its partners. Use of any of the services on the New Balance web site is entirely voluntary; however, if you do not provide the personal information requested by us, then we may elect not to make the related services available for your use.

In this regard, our policy is that we do not give, sell or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information to anyone outside the New Balance organization or selected New Balance partners unless we first disclose to you at the time of collection that your personal information may be provided to third parties. However, there are certain limited instances where we may disclose or transfer personally identifiable information. For example, we may provide such information to appropriate authorities if we believe in good faith that the law requires it or to protect the legal rights or property of New Balance. Additionally, as we continue to develop our business, we may buy or sell business assets. In such transactions, customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. However, we are not in the business of selling customer information to others, and aside from certain exceptional circumstances, we will take appropriate measures to ensure the protection of the information you provide to us.USE OF COOKIES
