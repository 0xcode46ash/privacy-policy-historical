**PRIVACY POLICY OF NEWSOK.COM**

 ****

NewsOK is committed to providing visitors with a powerful, useful and safe on-line experience, while at the same time protecting users from unexpected use of personally identifiable information. Like other web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more effective content and advertising, but only within the limits specified in this policy.

If you have questions about our privacy policy, please click on Contact Us, Web Staff with your inquiry via e-mail.

**_

Collection of Personal Information

_**

At certain sites, NewsOK may collect personally identifiable information that you provide, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. At other sites NewsOK collects non-personally identifiable demographic information, such as your zip code, age, interests or gender. Some sites may collect a combination of this information.

For example, we may collect information from: sweepstakes and contest registrations or submissions, voting and polling activities, registration for subscription services related to either the printed or electronic editions of the newspaper or from other interactive areas of our website. In connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you will be asked to provide information, including credit card information, that is necessary to complete a transaction that you have initiated and requested. There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by NewsOK, such as your IP address, browser type, domain name, access time and referring website addresses.

Please keep in mind that if you disclose personally identifiable information through our chat room, message boards or other public on-line forums, this information may be collected and used by others accessing those sites. NewsOK does not monitor or collect information you disclose inside on-line public forums **.**

 ****

NewsOK encourages you to review the privacy statements and policies of other websites you choose to link to from NewsOK, so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and store your information. NewsOK is not responsible for the privacy statements, policies or content of other websites, including websites you link to from our co-branded sites. Websites containing co-branding (referencing our name and a third party’s name) contain content delivered by the third party and not NewsOK.

**_

Cookies and Third Party Ad Networks

_**

NewsOK does not currently use "cookies" when you enter or navigate within our website. NewsOK uses third party ad-networks to display advertisements in our website. These third party ad-networks will use cookies in accordance with their own privacy policies. These third party ad-networks may compile information about you and your on-line computer use. If you want to prevent one of the third party ad-networks from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you will need to visit each ad-networks’ website and request that you be removed from their system.

**_

Use of Your Personal Information

_**

The information we gather from you may be used in several ways, now or in the future, as follows: 

    * To gain a better understanding of our users and their usage pattern as a whole


    * Site administration and troubleshooting


    * Process e-commerce transactions, contest entries and other matters you initiate


    * Identify preferences in content and advertising


    * Target editorial, advertising or other content (such as promotions, special offers or other content) we think might be of interest to you


    * To communicate changes and improvements to our website or any registration you have made



NewsOK does not sell, rent or lease its users personally identifiable information to any merchant, advertiser or web publisher. Non personally identifiable user information (such as usage pattern, browser type and your computer) may be shared with third party businesses or advertisers with which we have a business or contractual relationship.

**_

Control Your Personally Identifiable Information

_**

NewsOK does not, at this time, share your personally identifiable information with third party businesses or advertisers, but reserves the right to do so in the future. If at some point in the future we decide to do so in order to enhance your on-line experience as stated under "Use of Personal Information," we will post notice of that decision on this page. If you prefer that we not use your personally identifiable information to allow third parties to call your attention to products, special offers and unique content that may be of interest to you, you will be offered the ability to decline at that time. 

**_

Children

_**

NewsOK does not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from or about children under the age of thirteen, except as may be permitted by law. If we discover that we have received any such information from a child in violation of this policy, we will delete that information. If you believe that NewsOK has any information from or about a child under the age of thirteen, please contact us by clicking on "Contact Us", Web Staff and send us an e-mail. 

Please review the privacy policy of other sites you or your children elect to link to through NewsOK for their children’s privacy policy. NewsOK is not responsible for the privacy policy or other content of any other website, including sites that are co-branded.

The foregoing policy is effective Feb. 7, 2001. NewsOK reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.
