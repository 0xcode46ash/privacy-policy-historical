**4\. Who is collecting information?  
** When you are on newt.org and are asked for personal information, you are sharing that information with newt.org alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. 

In particular, since Newt's free weekly newsletter is distributed by HumanEvents.com, signing up at Newt.org will automatically enroll you to receive Newt's newsletter from HumanEvents.com.  Signing up at Newt.org will not enroll you in any other of HumanEvents.com's newsletters.

Please be aware that newt.org Internet access partners, advertisers, and web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you.

** As a general rule, newt.org will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it or under the circumstances described below.

Business Partners & Sponsors : newt.org may disclose your personal information to business partners or sponsors, but this is specifically described to you prior to data collection or prior to transferring the data.

Many promotions offer opportunities to request additional information from sponsors. By requesting more information, you give newt.org permission to transfer your personal information to the sponsor so they can fulfill your request. In many instances, only your email address will be shared. If more information will be shared with the sponsor, you will be notified prior to the transfer.

Newt.org partners with HumanEvents.com to distribute Newt’s free weekly newsletter.  We may from time to time also work with HumanEvents.com to send you special offers and advertisements for products or services offered by third parties. We will not disclose any of your personal information to such third parties when we do this.  Sending you offers from our sponsors is one of the ways we financially sustain Newt.org’s operations so we can continue to provide you with Newt’s latest analysis and news.

Other: newt.org may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) newt.org's rights or property, other newt.org users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, newt.org cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

**9\. What about children's privacy?  
** Naturally, the safety of children is very important to us. Newt.org recommends that parents review all the sites their children visit to ensure that age appropriate content.

Newt.org is a general audience web site that complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act.

Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator is permitted to require a child under the age of 13 to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. Newt.org abides by this requirement.

**10\. What else should I know about my privacy?  
** Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

Ultimately, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.
