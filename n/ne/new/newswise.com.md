### History

Newswise was the first online news service for universities and research institutions for knowledge-based news. It was created in 1991 by Roger Johnson, Ph.D., a biochemist who became a science writer and freelance reporter in the Washington, DC, area in 1978. 

Newswise is the most innovative service of its kind. It introduced the online research-news service concept and first implemented a central resource for high-caliber news, plus provided access to a one-stop, searchable news archive. Newswise was the first to provide reports to its clients on the activity of its releases. It introduced the concepts of Breaking News, Meetings Advance, and other tools for journalists and public information professionals to improve their delivery and management of information. 

Newswise expanded to the web in 1996. It is the most comprehensive site for research, or knowledge-based news, with more than 400 leading research institutions participating. 

Newswise moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2001 and has offices in Helsinki, Finland, and Athens, Greece.

### Vision

The Newswise vision is to improve the relationship between journalists and public relations professionals by creating online communications and information management tools that decrease the stress of information overload. We believe new online technology provides the opportunity to change the paradigm of media relations by decreasing the invasiveness of information while increasing access. Paradoxically, online technology benefits this relationship-building by improving information management and allowing a noninvasive way of initiating relationships. 

Newswise maintains a comprehensive online database of knowledge-based news. It is a one-stop site for reporters to manage information within focused domains. Newswise currently comprises scientific, medical, liberal arts, and business research news, with plans to grow in additional sectors. 

Newswise offers a seamless combination of web and email tools to access its database of knowledge-based news. This use of both email and web makes it easier for journalists to access the news; we deliver it to them, but only the news categories they choose, and on the schedule they select. Newswise currently archives more than 62,000 high-caliber news stories, and each is full-text searchable. 

Newswise also maintains a complement of other tools for journalists, including online calendars of science and medical meetings, and a database of awards, grants, and fellowships. We also broker and amplify reporters' searches for experts with an Expert Query service; this allows journalists to access experts in science, medicine, liberal arts, and business in a simple way. A variety of new online tools will continue to be added to this kit. 

Our goal is to add value to information by creating context and the best delivery system — gathering the information into one location, organizing it, categorizing it by both topic and type, making it searchable, updating it regularly, and providing an email delivery system suited to reporters' desires. This adds value to the information and decreases reporters' need to "browse" or "surf" the web, or to use web-wide search engines that provide too much unselected information, most of which is not news. Newswise puts reporters in the information loop, while allowing them to manage the information.

### Business

Newswise is an entrepreneurial business. Reporters receive the service free, and the institutions that provide the information pay a fee far less expensive than mailing or faxing news releases. Newswise develops policies based on suggestions by reporters and participating institutions, and welcomes new ideas. 

We also serve the public as a comprehensive news resource, providing information directly from the institutions producing the news. This is a public service, and our primary focus is on reporters and the institutions providing the news.

### Who is a Journalist?

To have access to certain privileged information on Newswise, a user must provide credentials documenting that he or she is a full-time, professional journalist (not a student, e.g.). 

  1. The applicant must: 
    1. be on the staff of a media outlet (newspaper, magazine, newsletter, television, radio, etc.), which must be a journalism organization. It cannot, for example, be a publication representing a commercial interest, single-source advertising, an advocacy group, or an organization with an agenda that is not transparent when reviewing the publication, **or**
    2. be a full-time freelancer. The person cannot have a full-time job representing any organization other than a journalism organization. The freelancer cannot represent a group (either on retainer or as a major percentage of his or her income) that creates a conflict of interest. 
  

  2. This definition precludes: 
    1. journalism students, professors, etc.; they are employed by a university or are not full-time, professional journalists. 
    2. those who work for an advocacy group, even if they write for publications produced by these groups. There are a few exceptions to this exclusion, such as reporters for the news sections of _Science_ magazine and _JAMA_. We will evaluate publications from associations such as these on a case-by-case basis to determine if they meet our criteria of bias-free journalism. 
  

  3. If an applicant provides false credentials or misleading or misrepresentative information, or does not provide complete or accurate information, and we discover undisclosed conflicts of interest, we will ban that person's participation.

### Embargoed News

Journalists are provided an exclusive review of embargoed news as a courtesy to allow them to prepare an article for publication after the embargo date and time. Embargoes should only be used for research results news to be published in an upcoming journal or to be presented at a meeting. In general, the embargo date is the day before the journal publication date or the day and time of the meeting presentation, but there are exceptions, and the embargo date and time should be honored. If there are questions about a printed embargo date, check with the source contact. 

Journalists agree explicitly, when applying for a PressPass, to honor all embargoed news. That is, they agree not to publish or release the information to the public prior to the embargo date and time. 

In return, Newswise and the source agree to make the information available only to journalists under password protection during the embargo period.
