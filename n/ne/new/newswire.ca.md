Canada NewsWire does not share the individual information we gather on the Internet with third parties. The information we gather is helpful to us in the development of our service, but respect for our viewers and their privacy rights motivates us to closely guard and protect that information. 

All personal information provided to us is securely stored on CNW servers. We use the information you provide in the following ways: 

  * To give the developers of the site information that is useful in determining appropriate new features, content, and services. 
  * To provide advertisers, partners and clients with aggregate – not individual – information about our user base. This is a key element in providing our service free of charge. 



Information about individual users is not shared with any third party. Viewer's individual privacy rights out-weigh any other considerations in this regard. There are no exceptions to this policy. 

If, during any of our registration processes, you indicated you would like to be kept updated on new site developments, or to receive further information from selected organizations, those updates will be sent to you by e-mail. If you decide at any time that you do not want to receive updates, just send an e-mail message to [cnw@newswire.ca](mailto:cnw@newswire.ca) indicating your preference not to receive updates and we will remove your name from the update list.
