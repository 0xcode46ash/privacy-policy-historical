**Automatically collected information**

We collect information in the aggregate form through the use of cookies and IP addresses, such as demographic information and browsing patterns, including domain and host from which you access the Internet, your domain name, the Internet protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using, the name of the page that referred you to us, the date and time you access our site, the pages you visited, and the entry and exit times from the politicaliq.com website. We also collect information about your interactions and transactions with us and some of our business partners. Such information does not identify any individual and will not be linked to any personal information. We use such information to: 

  * monitor the usage of our website,
  * build up marketing profiles,
  * aid strategic development,
  * manage our relationship with advertisers and content providers, and
  * audit usage of the site.



We may share such information, in the aggregate form only, with our affiliates, partners or advertisers, or other third parties. 

**Use of Information**

In addition to the uses described above with respect to information you provide and information we automatically collect, we use collected information to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you if necessary, conduct research, assist with systems administration, resolve problems, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. We may occasionally use your name and email address to send you notifications regarding new services we offer that we think you may find valuable. We may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. We may also create compilations of information that are not personally-identifying and provide these compilations to other companies to help them understand the shopping patterns or general interests of visitors to the politicaliq.com website. 

**Use of Cookies**

We use "cookies" to identify you when you visit this site and to build up a demographic profile. Our use of cookies also allows registered users to be presented with a personalized version of the politicaliq.com website. A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. Find out more about the use of cookies on [http://www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by NDN only, and does not cover the use of cookies or other tracking technologies by any of our advertisers. 

**Submissions**

Any personal information you choose to provide to us with your submissions posted to this site may appear on the site, but only to identify you as the author of the submission, unless you expressly authorize us to make further use of the information on the site. If you voluntarily disclose or permit disclosure of personal information, that information can also be collected and used by others. If you submit to the site any comments, photographs, videos, music text or other content, you grant to NDN the unlimited, perpetual, royalty-free right to use your name, voice, likeness and other personal information in connection with such submission in any media, now known or hereafter devised, throughout the world. 

**Privacy Policy for Children Under 13**

In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (commonly referred to as “COPPA”), we do not require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any more information than is reasonably necessary to participate and make use of this site and under no circumstances do we require children under the age of 13 to provide us with any personal information. Children under the age of 13 should not submit or post any personal information without the written consent of their parents or legal guardians. If you are a child under the age of 13 and want to submit your personal information to us, you should ask your parents to send an e-mail to [politicaliqsupport@dave.tv] specifically allowing us to collect your personal information through this site. By doing so, you allow us to alert your parent or guardian about this site's Privacy Policy. We do not intend to sell, license or trade any such information collected to third parties. Parents may review or change the personal information of their children provided to us or further refuse our collection of such information by sending an e-mail to [politicaliqsupport@dave.tv]. 

**Partner Sites / Linked Sites**

Our site features several activities, which are co-sponsored or operated by other sites. These activities will be identifiable by their co-branding. While these activities originate on the politicaliq.com website, they may link to other sites not operated by NDN. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of any of our co-sponsors and strongly recommend that you check their privacy policies before engaging in these activities. Additionally, our site contains links to other sites, including those of advertisers. We have no control over the privacy practices of advertisers or other sites to which we provide links from this site. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, the click takes you off this site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data or solicit personal information. We strongly recommend that you check the applicable privacy policy of the site to which you are linking. 

**Security of Information**

We use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your personally identifiable information secure. Unfortunately, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to take care to protect your personally identifiable information, NDN cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting it and misusing it when collecting credit card information for online purchases. We also store any personal information, including credit card numbers, in a secure area to which the general public does not have access. 

**Updating Personal Information**

If you would like to change any contact or billing information, or if you no longer desire to receive any marketing communications from us or our partners, please email us at [politicaliqsupport@dave.tv]. 

**Changes in Privacy Policy**

We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, and will post any changes to this policy as soon as they go into effect without prior notice to you. Any such changes are effective as of the date such changes are posted on this page. Please check this page periodically to view our most current Privacy Policy.
