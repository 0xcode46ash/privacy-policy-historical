**Background**  
At New Tech Network (“NTN”), we take the privacy of the participants in our ground-breaking 21st century educational services seriously. Please read this Privacy Statement to learn more about how we treat personally identifiable information. We provide this Privacy Statement because you have a right to know what information we collect, how it is protected and used, and the circumstances under which it may be disclosed. If you have comments, suggestions, questions, or concerns about our Privacy Statement, please contact our Privacy Director at [privacydirector@newtechnetwork.org](mailto:privacydirector@newtechnetwork.org), or in writing at:  
Privacy Director, New Tech Network

**Online Privacy Standards**  
While there are no official standards governing privacy practices on the internet, we follow the principles supported by the Federal Trade Commission's Fair Information Practices Principles, currently available at <http://www.ftc.gov/reports/privacy3/fairinfo.shtm>.

**What This Statement Covers**  
This Statement covers NTN’s treatment of personally identifiable information that we obtain when you visit our website, [www.newtechnetwork.org](http://www.newtechnetwork.org/ "www.newtechnetwork.org"), and when you become a user of our services through one of our school or school district alliances. We regard personally identifiable information as information that can be used to identify or contact you in person, such as your real name, telephone number, birth date, email address, or physical mailing address.

**What This Statement Does Not Cover**  
A key feature of NTN’s services is provided through alliances with partner schools and school districts (“Network Schools”). Please note that this Statement does not cover the privacy practices of third parties that we do not own or control, such as the Network Schools. In addition, we may provide links to other third-party websites that may interest our users. All of these third-party sites, including the Network School sites, operate independently of NTN and they have their own privacy or security practices. For your best on-line experience, we encourage you to review their policies before submitting any personal information to them.

**HOW AND WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED**

**Information Provided By Network Schools**  
Network Schools provide NTN with information that is necessary for NTN’s system to work for each Network School enrolled in the service. The information provided by Network Schools is limited to faculty name, faculty email address, student name, student email address, student graduation year and, of course, the identity of the Network school itself. Some Network Schools also elect to provide a student identification number to NTN, however, this information is not a requirement of using the NTN services. The information provided by the Network School may be updated from time to time over the course of the program services. 

**Information Provided In Discussion Boards**  
Information may be provided in a discussion board operated through the service. This information may be collected by NTN. Discussion boards are open forums in which users of the service participate. The information provided in the discussion boards is open for other registered users of the service from a particular Network School depending on the user’s access level. For example, a teacher can view the discussion board activity of all students in that particular teacher’s Network School. 

**Information Provided In The NTN Resource Library**  
NTN also maintains an online document library featuring articles and other documents. This library is freely available online, even to those without user accounts, and may be viewed globally by anyone with Internet access. You may submit articles or other documents for inclusion in this library by sending an email. Because of the open nature of the document library, NTN does not advise that you include any personally identifiable information in any submission to the document library. 

**Information Provided In A Survey**  
On occasion, NTN conducts surveys to help evaluate our services and improve the services we provide. The information collected through surveys is voluntary and is treated according to the terms of any particular survey issued by NTN. 

**We Do Not Collect Information Directly Through Our Website**  
Any user can visit our website at [www.newtechnetwork.org](http://www.newtechnetwork.org/ "www.newtechnetwork.org") without providing any identifying information. If you would like to customize your experience and take advantage of many of the features of the NTN service, however, you will first need to be registered through one of our Network Schools.
