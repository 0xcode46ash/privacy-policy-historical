# News & Record Privacy Policy for Electronic Publications and Interfaces : News-Record.com : Greensboro & the Triad's most trusted source for local news and analysis

As of April 18, 2001

### Introduction

Welcome to the News & Record, a newspaper located in the Piedmont Triad of North Carolina. We believe in your right to know what information is collected from you when doing business with us or visiting our web sites and how that information is used and safeguarded. The following privacy policy applies to News-Record.com, News&Record Interactive.com, News & Record Direct, and all other businesses and Web sites operated by the Greensboro News & Record, Inc.   
The News & Record is affiliated with other online companies, some of which feature our branding. This policy statement does not apply to those companies' web sites; please refer to these affiliated sites to obtain information on their privacy policies. These sites include, but are not limited to, Cars.com and Zip2.com.

### Your Personal Information

News-Record.com collects personally identifiable information (name, e-mail address, etc.) and/or demographic data (zip code, gender, interests, etc.) that you submit when you:

  1. register for Subscriber Advantage and other services 
  2. complete a survey 
  3. register for a promotion, contest or sweepstakes 
  4. order a subscription to our newspaper 
  5. send us an email

  6. place a classified ad 



Transaction information is encrypted and retained in a database not on a web site.   
We use this information to operate the News & Record's services, to provide you with the highest quality service, and to offer you opportunities we think will be of interest to you. We will send emails to those who have elected to receive them informing registered users about specific offers (from the News & Record and our advertising partners) that are of interest to them.   
We will not disclose any personal information without your advance permission except when we believe the law requires us to do so or the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights or property of the News & Record. In order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers and others, we may disclose user information-but only in an aggregate form. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are male or within a certain age range.   
Credit card information will be provided to third parties only to provide products and services that you order. We may use the contact information that you provide to contact you about your account and/or to send you necessary information directly related to the product or service for which you have registered.

### Surveys

The News & Record may occasionally use online surveys to ask visitors for feedback on our products and services as well as to collect contact information (such as email address). We may use contact data from such surveys to send the user information about our company or to contact users when necessary. Users may choose not to receive these future, direct communications; see the "Opt Out Procedures" below.

### Children's Privacy

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) stipulates that the web site operators cannot knowingly collect information from children under age 13 without verifiable parental permission. The News & Record respects the privacy of children, and does not seek children's participation in services that require registration. We strongly recommend that parents supervise their children's use of the Internet. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in email messages or forums.

### Opt Out Procedures

From time to time, we may send you information about various products and services. If you do not want to receive this information, you can opt out by using the "unsubscribe" feature in an email reply to us, or you may send your unsubscribe request via email to [feedback@news-record.com](mailto:feedback@news-record.com).   
We may also send you information from other companies that offer products and services that we believe you may enjoy. If you do not want to receive these messages from other companies, you can opt out by using the "unsubscribe" feature in an email reply to us, or you may send your unsubscribe request via email to [feedback@news-record.com](mailto:feedback@news-record.com).

### Correcting and Updating Your Private Information

The information that you provide to the News & Record may be stored by us for an indefinite time. However, please feel free to request a change or deletion of this information at any time by sending an e-mail to [feedback@news-record.com](mailto:feedback@news-record.com).

### Usage Tracking

We do track usage patterns on our web sites in order to break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). However, we do not match this information with a specific user or his or her personally identifiable information.

### Cookies

A "cookie" is a small text file that is placed in your browser and allows the News & Record to recognize you each time you visit a News & Record Web site. The News & Record does not use cookies to collect personal information. Instead, they allow us to see which parts of our site you have used so that we can better serve you when you return to our site. Cookies may be used to provide you with information and special opportunities tailored to your interests.

### Security

The security of the information that you provide to the News & Record is very important to us. We use SSL encryption software and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of sensitive information under our control. However, our web sites include links to other sites, and when you choose to visit those sites, we are not responsible for their privacy policies. In addition, we may permit third parties to offer registration-based services through our site. We are not responsible for the actions and policies of these third parties, and you should review the privacy policies of these parties when supplying personally identifiable information to them.

### Remember the Risks Whenever You Use the Internet

You should know that when you voluntarily disclose personal information to the public on the News & Record web sites and its affiliated sites (for example, in electronic forums, chat rooms, and other public posting areas such as Bidzilla), that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other people. While we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot be responsible for information that you choose to publicly disclose. Further, you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any passwords or other account information.   
Our partners and other Internet sites or services that may be accessible through the News & Record sites have separate data and privacy practices that are independent of us, and we disclaim any responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. Please contact those sites directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.

### Direct Marketing Association

The News & Record is a member of the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) and we observe the industry's Privacy Promise and the DMA's Marketing Online Privacy Principles. If you have any questions about DMA policies for members, please contact the DMA at 202-955-5030. The News & Record reserves the right to change this policy as business needs require. Any changes will be posted to this page in a timely manner.
