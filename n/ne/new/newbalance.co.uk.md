Last Updated December 1, 2011.

Thank you for placing your trust in New Balance. You are very important to us and we want to provide you with a safe and secure online experience. This Privacy and Cookies Notice describes how we collect and use your information and explains the choices that you have with regard to how we use your information. The Privacy and Cookies Notice applies to "[www.newbalance.co.uk](http://www.newbalance.co.uk/)" (the "Service") operated by New Balance Athletic Shoe, Inc. and its affiliates ( “New Balance”, “we”, “us”, or “our”), whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Service) or you are a “Member” (which means that you have registered or transacted with the Service or a component thereof). New Balance will be a Data Controller for the purposes of relevant EU Data Protection legislation. By using the Service and providing us with information through the Service, you consent to this Privacy Notice. We suggest that you review this Privacy Notice periodically as we will update and change it from time to time.

**What information does New Balance collect about me?**

Like most websites, every time you visit our Service, we automatically collect information from you that would not allow you to be personally identifiable to us. Examples of this type of information include:

  * The type of Internet browser you are using
  * The type of computer operating system you are using
  * The domain name of your Internet service provider
  * The Web page from which you came
  * The pages you visit on our website



When you visit the Service, we may track your visit and, as described below in the section concerning “cookies”, collect certain data regarding your use of the Service and your activity on the Service, but we will not collect any identifiable information, such as name, email address, postal address, phone number, gender, and, when necessary, credit card information or other information necessary to process your order or send you special announcements (“Personal Information”) from you unless you choose to provide it to us.

When you make a purchase from New Balance, request to sign up for email or direct mail, we collect Personal Information that you have volunteered. Your submission of this Personal Information is entirely voluntary; however, if you elect not to provide this Personal Information, some of the services and/or features available on and/or through the Service may not be available for your use.

We also collect Personal Information when you elect to submit such information to us when you register for "My Account", participate in a contest, event or sweepstakes promotion, fill out a survey, or contact us (for example via email or by selecting "Ask the Expert" from the Service).

We may also obtain data through your Internet browser, such as your IP Address, which is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet.

**How do you use my Personal Information?**

The Personal Information we receive allows us to personalize our product offering and improve your online shopping experience, making it more convenient, efficient and enjoyable. We may use the Personal Information that you submit to us through the Service to: 

  * Customize your communications and shopping experience
  * Process your purchase, confirm your orders and communicate to you about account information or customer service needs
  * Adapt the content and layout of our pages tailored to your needs and so you do not have to enter information more than once
  * Notify you about new products and services, special offerings and other promotions
  * Coordinate contests, promotions, surveys or other website features
  * Improve our business and better respond to your needs



**How do you share my information?**

For the purpose of operating our business, we may transfer your Personal Information to our international offices and/or to third party service providers who may be located anywhere in the world who use that information only to conduct New Balance business. For example, these third party service providers may handle New Balance credit card processing, shipping, data management, email distribution, information analysis, and promotions management. We provide our preferred service providers with the Personal Information they need to perform their services and work with them to respect and protect your Personal Information. If you do not want New Balance to transmit your Personal Information to our third party service providers in accordance with this Privacy Notice, please follow the procedures described under the Opt-Out/Unsubscribe section below. By providing us with your Personal Information you agree that we may transfer the data outside the European Union for as set out in this Privacy and Cookies Notice.

We may use aggregated statistical information derived from your Personal Information for purposes such as reporting and marketing. For these purposes no use will be made of your Personal Information.

On rare occasions, we may disclose Personal Information upon governmental request, in response to a court order, when required by law, to enforce our website policies, or to protect our or others' rights, property, or safety. We may also share Personal Information with companies assisting in fraud protection or investigation. We do not provide Personal Information to these agencies or companies for marketing or commercial purposes.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Notice or with your prior consent, we will not sell, trade or rent Personal Information to other companies as part of our regular course of business. However, it's possible that we might acquire or merge with or be acquired by another company or that we might dispose of some or all of our assets. If that happens, your Personal Information may be disclosed to another company, but that disclosure will be subject to the Privacy Notice in effect.

**What about information that I post to blogs and other public areas of the Service?**

This Privacy Notice does not apply to any Personal Information collected by New Balance through means other than the Service. This Privacy Notice shall not apply to any unsolicited, whether or not personal, information you provide through the Service or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to, information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as the NB blog, any ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, and/or other unsolicited submissions (collectively, “Unsolicited Information”). All Unsolicited Information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and you consent to New Balance being able to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute anywhere in the world such Unsolicited Information to others without limitation or attribution. You should exercise caution before you post Personal Information that you post in public forums, such as the NB blog. Once you release your Personal Information for posting on public forums, New Balance cannot and will not be responsible for the privacy and/or security of such information.

**How do I know my Personal Information is secure?**

We have a variety of security measures to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information that we have collected from you from the Service. To ensure the information you provide online is secure during transmission, we use leading-edge encryption technology and Secure Socket Layers (SSL) while processing any Personal Information you supply.

These controls are certified by VeriSign®, a leading Internet security company. You can review our security certificate using your browser by clicking on the closed lock or solid key image at the bottom of your browser on any of the secure pages on our site. This will display our Service security information.

For security purposes, your full credit card number is not permanently stored within our system. On occasion, we may temporarily store the entire encrypted credit card number when it is necessary to manually contact a credit card company for verification.

**What is the New Balance Children's Privacy Notice?**

We do not knowingly ask for Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 (a "Child").

While New Balance's [Terms and Conditions](http://www.newbalance.co.uk/Terms-Conditions-of-Sale/terms,en_GB,pg.html) prohibits children under 18 from registering with the Service, parents should supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing online their name, address and other Personal Information without parental permission.

Therefore, we will not be responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, availability, reliability, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in third party sites linked to our Service. We strongly encourage you to review the terms and privacy policies of any third party sites before using their sites.
