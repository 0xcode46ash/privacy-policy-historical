You must be thirteen (13) years of age or older to be a member of our website and receive membership benefits, and you must be eighteen (18) years of age or older to participate in our A-List Invitations. We may conduct other contests, sweepstakes and/or special events over our site. To participate in these events, you must meet the designated minimum age requirements (for example, twenty-one years of age or older) for the specific event. Please see our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20021202070111id_/http%3A//newyorkmetro.com/nym/terms.htm) for additional information on membership and/or participation on our website. 

**III.   Collection of Personal Information**

We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website. To operate these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information from our visitors for specific purposes. For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policy or our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20021202070111id_/http%3A//newyorkmetro.com/nym/terms.htm). We may retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our database and to comply with various federal and state laws. 

**IV.   Registration for Participation in Website Activities and Services**

**V. Use and Collection of Information by Newyorkmetro.com**

To participate as a member of our website, or in online activities, special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas ("Interactive Areas" include chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards or auditoriums), you may be required to provide personally identifiable information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender ("personal information"). We may also survey visitors about various topics, including local events and experiences, television viewing preferences and how we can improve our website and services. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary. 

We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to operate our membership base, protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in specified activities or Interactive Areas and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website. 

We may also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card or website link to another person to inform them about the New York Metro site and our features. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-cards. 

The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you through our website. This website does not collect additional personal information about individual visitors or members from other sources. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we may collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the webpage from which a person enters our site, webpages visited, duration of visit and domain type. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity. 

We may produce certain contests, sweepstakes and special events with the support of affiliated or non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by New York Metro and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). For each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will post on the website applicable rules for the event, and if necessary, post any supplemental terms and conditions or privacy provisions. To the extent there is a conflict between those privacy provisions and this policy, the privacy provisions for the specific event will govern. 

**VI. Use and Collection of Information by Operational Providers**

For the convenience of our visitors, we may provide the opportunity to purchase certain goods, merchandise and services through this website. Companies other than New York Metro, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations, order fulfillment and/or contract services "operational providers." If you choose to use these optional services, our operational providers will request your personal information to fulfill your order or request. The voluntary submission of your personal information to these operational providers, including your order or request, will be governed by the specific provider's terms of usage and privacy policies. To facilitate an order or request, we may share your personal information with the provider. The operational provider may also share your personal information with us. We will store this information in our membership database. 

In most instances, we request that our operational providers adhere to the provisions in New York Metro's Privacy Policy and that such providers only share visitors' personal information with New York Metro, unless necessary to complete a visitor's request or order. We also request that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale or fulfilling the requested service or order. However, you must read an operational providers privacy policy to determine the extent of use and disclosure of your personal information collected online. 

New York Metro, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of operational providers, nor is the New York Metro family responsible or liable for the products or services provided by operational providers. 

**VII.   Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties Other than New York Metro**

We only share or disclose your personal information with companies other than New York Metro when it is required by law, disclosure is necessary to operate the website or certain website services, to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property and/or when disclosure is consistent with New York Metro's practices for services that are similarly provided offline. 

New York Metro is a partnership between Primedia Inc.'s New York Magazine and Metro Channel L.L.C., a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings, Inc. We may in the future share personal information with our parents, partners, affiliates or other entities for other purposes. If we decide to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose to our registered members and in this Privacy Policy the name of the entity(s) that we will share information with, what type of personal information will be shared, how the information will be used, and how to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out"). We may conduct joint activities with members of the New York Metro family; however, we will not share individual visitors' personal information with these entities unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy. 

When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect your e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our Terms of Usage Agreement. We may share your personal information with our operational providers or those persons, companies or agents who provide support for the internal operations of the website, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors. If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order. 

We may collect and provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on the site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

This site uses clear GIFs [Graphics Interchange Formats] (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs).

We use GIFs to gather non-personal, aggregate information on visits to our website, track usage of website links and assist with registration and log-on features, including chat rooms and e-mail. We do not disclose personal information that may be linked to our GIF collection practices to third parties. Other websites may also use clear GIFs. New York Metro, its parents and subsidiaries are not responsible for the use of clear GIFs by other website operators. Visitor’s must review other website operators’ privacy policies to determine the type and extent of tracking devices used. 

**IIX.   Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors**

Our website may post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of affiliate entities or of advertisers or sponsors which are companies that are not owned or operated by New York Metro, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These entities may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you link to or visit an advertiser's or sponsor's website, we may frame the site with our website logo; however, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. New York Metro, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries will not be responsible for advertiser or sponsor ads and/or links or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors. 

We may also provide co-branded services or promotions with certain sponsors or other entities. As a part of these services or promotions, we may request the submission of your personal information over our website for participation and/or registration. We may also share your information with the sponsor or entity assisting with the service or promotion to fulfill your request. If the co-sponsor or other entity collects your personal information, they may also share your information with us. 

**IX.   How To Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information**

You may add, change or delete personal information on your profile or registration for activities by contacting us via e-mail. Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes in your membership information and e-mail address. 

**X.   Our Security Procedures **

We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. Credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology. If we decide to share visitor information with other members of the New York Metro family, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website. 

For the convenience of our visitors, we may offer a list of helpful website links provided by other entities and/or persons. New York Metro does not endorse or recommend, nor is it liable for, the products or services of any websites not owned or operated by New York Metro. When you visit other websites you will also be subject to the privacy policies and terms of usage agreements, if any, of that website operator. 

**XI.   Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy**

We will review our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, and we may modify our policies as New York Metro deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will post these changes in this policy. We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis. 

_CHILDREN'S PRIVACY POLICY_ New York Metro respects the privacy of your child and we want to share with you our policies regarding children under the age of thirteen. We have developed this site to appeal to visitors over the age of thirteen. Although visitors of all ages may navigate through our website, we do not knowingly collect personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on this site by using false information, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation, and delete the child's personally identifiable information, user name and password from our records. 

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in the following circumstances allowed by law: 

  * To provide notice and get consent from a parent or guardian; 
  * To respond to a one-time request from a child, after which we will immediately delete the child's information; 
  * To fulfill a child's request for a subscription to a online newspaper, magazine or specific information on a regular basis and we will notify the parent or guardian before we contact the child again; 
  * To protect the safety of a child who is participating on this site; and 
  * To protect the security or integrity of the site, take precautions against liability, respond to a validly executed subpoena or warrant from law enforcement, or if permitted under other provisions of law.
