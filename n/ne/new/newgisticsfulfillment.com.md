Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on our Site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information you submit while on our Site. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We set a persistent cookie to store your passwords, so you don’t have to enter it more than once. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our Site, but your ability to use some areas of our Site will be limited.

Analytics/Log Files

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Site, analyze trends, track users’ movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in improving the Site, and to deliver content that is customized and personalized. IP addresses are not linked to personal information.

3rd Party Tracking

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, or service providers is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, or service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our Site. 

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help better manage content on our Site. We do not tie the information gathered to personal information.

Security

This Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you enter sensitive information (such as a User ID and password) on our service platform, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). All of your personal information is stored in computers at a 24 hour guarded facility behind a secure, multi-layer firewall that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Newgistics. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your private information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of such information.
