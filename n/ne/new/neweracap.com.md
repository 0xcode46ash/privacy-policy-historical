PRIVACY POLICY_**

New Era Cap takes your privacy as seriously as you do. We understand that you want to control your personal information, whether it concerns demographics or preferences. And we don't think having a good shopping experience means receiving unsolicited "related" e-mail from other companies after you've made your purchase. We don't like it and we won't do it. Accordingly, New Era Cap is committed to the responsible management of consumer information and abides by all rules, both ethical and legal, with respect to the use of consumer information. We strictly adhere to all established industry guidelines, and are continuously monitoring and enhancing how we manage the use and security of consumer information to uphold your rights. 

Our privacy policy is intended to notify you of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; what organization is collecting the information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company’s control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. Our privacy policy outlines the type of information we collect and store, our usage policy, and who to contact with questions or concerns.

Finally, please note that this privacy policy applies only to this site and not to other Web sites to which we link. We have clearly marked this site with our logo so you know where this policy applies.

**What information does New Era Cap collect and how does New Era Cap use it?**

  * When you order products or register on the site, we need you to provide your name, e-mail address, mailing address, day phone number and credit card information (when ordering products only). This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to New Era Cap, and receive back either the information or products desired.  

  * When ordering products and/or registering, we also allow you the discretion whether or not to submit additional information regarding your interests. This allows us to better know you and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to you.  

  * You will also be given a choice when registering whether you would like to be on New Era Cap’s mailing list, or whether you would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from New Era Cap.  

  * When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, New Era Cap may again ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so that we are able to better administer the contest and notify winners.  

  * New Era Cap also gathers certain usage information like the number and frequency of visitors to our site and its pages. Such information is only used by New Era Cap in the aggregate in order to allow us to determine how much our customers use certain portions of the site so that we can improve the site to assume that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of our customers as possible.  

  * New Era Cap may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, or would like to opt-out of any other information request or distribution, simply reply to any New Era Cap e-mail sent to you and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of your reply.   

  * In addition to providing the foregoing information to our supplier and merchants who help us process your order, if you choose to correspond further with us through e-mail, New Era Cap may retain the content of your e-mail messages together with your e-mail address and our response. 



**How does New Era Cap protect visitor information?  
**New Era Cap implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information to ensure a safe and secure shopping experience on our site. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information supplied by users is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or other standard security encryption technology and then encrypted into New Era Cap’s databases to be only accessed as stated above.

**Does New Era Cap use "cookies"?  
**For each visitor to our site, our server automatically recognizes your domain name, the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to our site and certain other non-personal information utilizing standard technology referred to as "cookies". Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on the site. New Era Cap uses cookies so that we can help provide our visitors with a better experience on our site. 

**Does New Era Cap disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?  
**New Era Cap does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration or contest submission. This information is used to better understand visitors’ use of New Era Cap’s site and to support related transactions made on the site. 

However, this data in an aggregate form may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. New Era Cap may also use e-mail addresses and other personally identifiable information to contact visitors who communicate with us. For example, we direct e-mail to visitors who provide us with their e-mail addresses for specific purposes such as receiving our e-mail newsletters or being notified if they have won one of our contests. Each e-mail newsletter always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to any New Era Cap e-mail sent to them and type UNSUBSCRIBE as the subject of their reply.

**NEW ERA CAP’S SPECIAL NOTE TO PARENTS  
**New Era Cap realizes that many children will visit them on the Internet, and New Era Cap therefore encourages children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any web site, including New Era Cap’s. However, New Era Cap believes that it is ultimately the parents’ responsibility to supervise their children’s online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the _[Direct Marketing Association home page](http://www.the-dma.org/)_.

**How does a visitor opt-out, remove, or modify information they have provided to New Era Cap?  
**After gathering any user information, New Era Cap offers users the opportunity to remove their information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer interact with our site until they later chose to do so by contacting us as set forth below. New Era Cap additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by sending an e-mail of those changes to [webservice@neweracap.com](mailto:webservice@neweracap.com).

**THIRD PARTY LINKS  
**In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, New Era Cap may choose various third party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with New Era Cap, New Era Cap has no control over these linked sites who each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of New Era Cap. New Era Cap has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, New Era Cap seeks to protect the integrity of its web site and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any [_feedback_](mailto:webmaster@neweracap.com) on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work).

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
