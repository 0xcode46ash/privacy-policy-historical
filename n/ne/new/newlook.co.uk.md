# Security | New Look UK

If you’ve got any questions, comments and requests about your account security, then please use the [Contact Us](http://www.newlook.com/uk/help/contact-us#/Top) form.

For your security, any new password you create with us has to be at least 7 characters and contain a mix of letters and numbers. However, we recommend that you set a password of at least 10 characters including capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. 

To access your stored data on our sites, you’ll need to sign in with your username and password. It’s your responsibility to keep these details secret and to ensure you don’t let anyone else use your account. If you have any concerns about your sign in details or think they’ve been misused, please contact us straight away and we can put your account on hold immediately. 

From time to time, we may make services provided by third parties available through our sites. To use these services, you must register with these third parties and deal with them direct. We have no control over the content of those third party sites or the performance of these services. Please note, that you use these services at your own risk and that we can't accept any responsibility for them or for any loss or damage that may arise from your use of them. Please check third parties privacy policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

We use the Verified by Visa and MasterCard SecureCode schemes to help stop unauthorised purchases with your debit or credit card.

When you reach our secure checkout you can choose to register for Verified by Visa or MasterCard SecureCode. Just sign up using the on-screen prompts, create a password then continue shopping. You only have to sign up once – then you can use your password when you shop with us or with other participating online stores.

For security, this password will be linked to your debit or credit card, and not your New Look account or your computer.

Alternatively, you can contact your bank directly for more information. Please note, if you decide not to register, we may need to ask you for an alternative payment method to complete your purchase.
