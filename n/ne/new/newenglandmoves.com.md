# Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to current and former customers of NRT Insurance Agency. The following policies and procedures protect the privacy of your information, whether you are a current or former customer:

Categories of Information We May Collect

In the normal course of business, we collect information necessary to offer quality products and services. For instance, we may obtain information such as your name, address, Social Security number, creditworthiness or credit history. Depending upon the products and services you purchase, we may also require information on your driving record and health status. We obtain this information from your applications and supporting forms, your transactions with us, our affiliated companies or non-affiliated third parties, from consumer reporting agencies, and from your medical provider, health reports and third parties such as the Medical Information Bureau.

The collection of this information, often necessary to properly evaluate, maintain, and service your account, may occur at various times while you have an account relationship with us. We make every effort to maintain accurate and complete customer information.

How We Use Your Information

Sharing Information Outside of the Cendant Family of Companies  
We may share all of the information we collect about you, as described above, with companies outside of the Cendant Family of Companies who perform marketing services on our behalf or with other financial institutions with which we have joint marketing agreements. We may also share information with companies outside of the Cendant Family of Companies as permitted by law, such as to respond to a subpoena or court order, to prevent fraud or to comply with an inquiry by a government agency.

We will not sell your personal information and we will not permit third parties, with whom we legally share your personal information, to sell, market, or resell your personal information.

Sharing Information within the Cendant Family of Companies  
We may share transaction and experience information about you, including identifying information (such as your name and address), and other information permitted by law, within the Cendant Family of Companies. The Cendant Family of Companies includes financial services companies and non-financial services companies (such as real estate brokerage companies and others).

Safeguarding Your Information

Access to customer information is limited to personnel who need the information to perform their job responsibilities. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed applicable regulations. We periodically review our security standards, procedures and technology to protect against unauthorized access to your confidential information.
