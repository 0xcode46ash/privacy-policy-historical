# NewCars.com Privacy Policy

Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Better Business Bureau's [BBBOnLine Privacy Program](https://web.archive.org/rd.php?http://www.bbbonline.org/cks.asp?id=103012218215929215!!m_id=800&l_id=105&zip=&model_id=0&detid=999), we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information.

NewCars.com is committed to online data security. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available through a link on all of our pages.

The Information We Collect

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the NewCars.com Web site. On some pages, you can request quotes and register to be contacted by NewCars.com affiliates. The types of personal information collected on these pages are:

> Name  
>  Address  
>  E-mail address  
>  Phone number  
>  Car preference information

An individual must disclose some personally identifiable information to receive a valid quote and/or requested information. Without this personal information, NewCars.com is unable to fulfill the request for a quote or other requested information.

Qualified Dealers and Other Third Parties

The NewCars.com car referral service uses a national network of high-quality dealers. They are dedicated to delivering competitive, haggle-free pricing, fast turnaround and excellent service. Approximately 90% of quote requests will be collected by NewCars.com. In areas where NewCars.com does not have any dealer coverage, you will be redirected to our affiliates' sites: Dealix (InvoiceDealers), JumpStart, AutoBuyingUSA or AutoNation.

In this case, the previously listed affiliates will collect personally identifiable information from you and use this information according to their own privacy and security policies, which can be further evaluated on [Dealix](http://invoicedealers.com/PrivacyPolicy.asp), JumpStart, [AutoBuyingUSA](http://www.autobuyingusa.com/privacypolicy.html) and [AutoNation](http://autonation.com/Corporate/Default.asp?Page=Privacy).

Our Commitment to Data Security

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Should you wish to access, review, update or correct all your personally identifiable information that we collected online, please e-mail us at [info@newcars.com](mailto:info@newcars.com).

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows an error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

The Way We Use Information

We use the information you provide about yourself when requesting a quote only to complete that particular request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your request.

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive and to inform you about new additions to our Web site. Such addresses are not used for any purpose other than that for which they were submitted and are not shared with outside parties.

The collected personal identification information is used for the purpose it was submitted for and NewCars.com's own marketing. At the first time of any first marketing contact between NewCars.com and the prospect, NewCars.com offers individuals a choice as to whether or not they would like to receive marketing in form of newsletters, etc. from NewCars.com.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.

We never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described previously without also providing you with an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

Finally, the collected personally identifiable information is never shared with outside parties or corporate affiliates with different privacy notices.

Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information on our Web site from those we actually know are under 16. No part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 16.
