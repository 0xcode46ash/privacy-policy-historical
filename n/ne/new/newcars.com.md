Appr. 90% of quote requests will be collected by NewCars.com. In areas where NewCars.com does not have any dealer coverage, you will be redirected to our affiliates' sites, StoneAge, Car.com, Dealix (InvoiceDealers), JumpStart, AutoBuyingUSA, AutoByTel, or AutoNation.

We, qualified car dealers, Dealix, E-loan, 4Insurance, and 1SourceWarranty use return email addresses to answer the email we receive and to inform you about new additions to our website. Such addresses are not used for any purpose other than that for which they were submitted and are not shared with outside parties.

The collected personal identification information is used for the purpose it was submitted for and NewCars.com own marketing.
