NewsLinQ.com has no control of what the business will use this information for nor will we use this information. If you have concerns or questions, please contact the business (web store) directly. 

Businesses that use our Site Promoter tools to market and advertise their site on the Internet are requested to submit information about them to third parties such as search engines, banner exchange affiliates, auction programs, etc. Once submitted, NewsLinQ.com will forward such information to those entities and will not have control over the resulting activities.
