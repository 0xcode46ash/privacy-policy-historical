# Privacy Policy - NewsCred

California Residents

Last Updated: June 2017

NewsCred values and respects your privacy. This Privacy and Cookie Policy (“Policy”) describes the types of personal data we collect, how we use the information, with whom we share it, and the choices you can make about our collection, use and disclosure of the information. We also describe the measures we take to protect the security of the information and how to contact us about our privacy practices.

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. We will only process your personal data in accordance with applicable data protection and privacy laws. For the purpose of EU data protection legislation, the data controller is NewsCred, Inc., of 386 Park Avenue South, 6th Floor, New York, NY 10016.

#### Information We Collect

NewsCred may obtain personal data about you from various sources, including our websites (including websites we operate on behalf of our clients), when you call or email us, communicate and/or engage with content through social media, or when you participate in events or other promotions. We also may obtain information about you from our business partners, clients and other third parties. For the purposes of this Policy, “personal data” shall have the meaning given to it by EU Directive 95/46 EC.

##### Types of Information

When you visit and interact with our websites and/or our customers’ websites, certain information may be collected via a cookie, including:

  1. your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address;

  2. your browser type and operating system;

  3. search terms that you use to reach the site;

  4. the web pages you were visiting immediately before and after you came to the site;

  5. dates and times of visits to the site;

  6. information on actions taken on the site (such as page views and site navigation patterns);

  7. amount of time spent viewing certain pages or screens;

  8. standard server log information;

  9. social actions taken with respect to the content on the site, including but not limited to Likes, Shares, Tweets, Retweets, Favorites and Pins on LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest; and/or

  10. advertisement interaction and viewing data, such as ad click-through rates and information about how many times you viewed a particular ad.




##### Information From Social Networking Sites

Our website includes interfaces that allow you to connect with social networking sites (each an “SNS”). If you connect to an SNS through our site, you authorise us to access, use and store the information that you agreed the SNS could provide to us based on your settings on that SNS. We will access, use and store that information in accordance with this Policy. You can revoke our access to the information you provide in this way at any time by amending the appropriate settings from within your account settings on the applicable SNS.

##### Third Party Links

Please note that NewsCred’s website and our customers’ websites may contain links to other websites and gather data from social media sites, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest. We recommend that you read the privacy policies of the aforementioned sites and every website that you visit. We are not responsible for those sites’ privacy practices.

When you visit our websites and/or our customers’ websites, NewsCred and our customers may also collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or online services. Because there is not yet a consensus on how companies should respond to web browser-based or other do-not-track (“DNT”) mechanisms, we do not respond to web browser-based DNT signals at this time.

##### Information Automatically Collected

We automatically log information about you and your computer or mobile device. For example, we log your IP address and unique cookie ID using cookies. Please refer to the sections on Cookies below.

##### Cookies

**What are cookies?**  
We may collect information using “cookies”. Cookies are small data files stored on the hard drive of your computer or mobile device by a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer or mobile device until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. We use two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your computer or mobile device, which are used only by us to recognise your computer or mobile device when it revisits our Site; and (2) third party cookies, which are served by service providers on our Site, and can be used by such service providers to recognise your computer or mobile device when it visits other websites.

We also may use the information we obtain about you in other ways for which we provide specific notice at the time of collection.

##### Business Communications

You may provide your email address to us or other contact information to receive industry news, intelligence, information about NewsCred products and services, and other business communications.

#### Business Transitions

In the event NewsCred goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users’ personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.

#### Disclosure

We may share the information we maintain about you with our service providers, business partners and clients. NewsCred also may need to disclose personal information when required by law and/or when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a) a current judicial proceeding, b) a court order or c) legal process served on NewsCred.

If you participate in certain features of this website (e.g., sharing content), please note that any information you voluntarily disclose through use of these features becomes available to the public and/or to other users whom you have designated.

#### Information Security

NewsCred has technical, administrative and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of user information we maintain. We recognize, however, that no program is one hundred percent secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose personal information. If you become aware of a security issue, please email us at privacy [at] newscred [dot] com. We will work with you to address any problems.

#### Your Rights and Choices

You may opt out of cookies on NewsCred’s websites and our customers’ websites by downloading the plugin located at <https://www.ghostery.com/en/download>. However, if you refuse cookies, you may be unable to access certain parts of these websites or be unable to use some of our and/or our customers’ services.

You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time on legitimate grounds, to the processing of your personal information, including the sharing of your information with third parties, by emailing privacy [at] newscred [dot] com. We will apply your preferences going forward. In some circumstances, withdrawing your consent to NewsCred’s use or disclosure of your personal information will mean that you cannot take advantage of certain NewsCred products or services.

#### Data Retention

We will retain your personal data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

#### Data Transfers

This is a U.S. website subject to U.S. laws, including those governing the privacy and security of your information. When we obtain personal information about you, we may process the information outside of the country in which you are located, including in the United States. The countries in which we process the information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you are located. We will protect your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

If you are a California resident, you may request that we provide to you (i) a list of the categories of personal information about you that NewsCred has disclosed to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes during the calendar year preceding your request, (ii) the names and addresses of such third parties, and (iii) if the nature of the third parties’ business cannot reasonably be determined from their names, examples of the products or services marketed, if known to NewsCred, sufficient to give you a reasonable indication of the nature of the third parties’ business. To submit your request, please email privacy [at] newscred [dot] com, with the subject line “California Privacy” and your request in the body of your email.
