We believe these are the reasons you do business with Northeast Credit Union.

These practices are followed by the credit union and its affiliate, Borthwick Associates, and therefore, this notice will be applied to both. If you have any questions after reading it, please contact us at 

_1-888-436-1847_. 

What follows is a description of the information we collect and disclose, including the parties who receive non-public information from us. This notice also explains your right to inform us if you do not want us to disclose certain information about you to other parties.

_**Disclosure of Information to Parties that Provide Services to Us**_

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements so that we may provide members competitive products and services. We may also disclose non-public personal information about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law.

_**Disclosure of Information About Former Members** If you cease to be a member of Northeast Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.  _

__**How to Opt Out or Stop Certain Disclosures About You**__

 _Please see attached list of third parties which you may opt out of if you choose.     
If you prefer that we do not disclose non-public personal information about you to non-affiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures, that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to opt out of disclosures to non-affiliated third parties, you may select one of the following: _

Once we receive your request, we have a reasonable amount of time to stop the disclosures. You may always contact us for assistance if you wish to later revoke your opt out election. 

_**Opt Out Treatment of Joint Account Holder or Co-borrower/Guarantor**_

Northeast Credit Union will treat a request to opt out from any joint consumer (joint account holder, co-borrower/guarantor) and apply the Opt Out request to everyone on the account. If a joint account holder or co-borrower/guarantor does not want to opt out (wants information shared with non-affiliated third parties that fall under the Opt Out definition - see attached Opt Out List) then the joint account holder or co-borrower/guarantor may establish his/her own account as long as the requirements for that account are met. 

_**How We Protect Your Information**_
