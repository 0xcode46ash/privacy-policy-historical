# Privacy Policy

Summary

At Northeast Credit Union we are committed to protecting   
your privacy. 

We recognize that preserving your trust includes protecting your privacy. The Board of Directors, management and staff of Northeast Credit Union considers this a priority. You should know that the information you provide us with consists of private personal information. We do not share any information with third parties other than what is necessary to provide you with the services or products you have requested, or is required by law, or to protect ourselves against fraud. Exception: we do share member names and addresses with Larry N. Walters Insurance Administrator, a business entity offering interested members Accidental Death and Dismemberment insurance.   If you have any questions about our policy, please contact a member service representative at 603-436-1847 or toll-free at 1-888-436-1847.

  
Privacy Notice

Northeast Credit Union's single purpose is to provide you with financial products and services to meet your financial goals. We intend to offer you diverse financial services including competitive products made available by our strategic relationships with other institution or service providers. We believe these are the reasons you do business with Northeast Credit Union. We also believe you do your financial business with us because we have a strong history of protecting our members' privacy.

We are required by law to give you this privacy notice. It describes our policies and practices that protect your privacy and enable us to share information to make available competitive financial products and services. These practices are followed by the credit union and its affiliate, Borthwick Associates, and therefore, this notice will be applied to both. If you have any questions after reading it, please contact us at 1-888-436-1847.

What follows is a description of the information we collect and disclose, including the parties who receive non-public information from us. This notice also explains your right to inform us if you do not want us to disclose certain information about you to other parties.

  
Information We Collect About You

We collect information about you from the following sources:

We MAY disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, as permitted by law.

  
Parties Who Receive Information From Us

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the following types of third parties:

  
Disclosure of Information to Parties that Provide Services to Us

We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements so that we may provide members competitive products and services. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you under circumstances as permitted or required by law. These disclosures typically include information to process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of our credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize or protect the security of financial records.

  
Disclosure of Information About Former Members

If you cease to be a member of Northeast Credit Union, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as may be permitted or required by law.

  
How to Opt Out or Stop Certain Disclosures About You

Please see attached list of third parties which you may opt out of if you choose.  If you prefer that we do not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to non-affiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures, that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties, you may select one of the following: 

Call the following toll-free number, 1-888-436-1847. 

You may opt out of these disclosures at any time. This opt out, by law, will not apply to disclosures that are legally permitted or to disclosures we make to companies that perform services on our behalf or to other service providers or institutions that have joint marketing agreements with us.

Once we receive your request, we have a reasonable amount of time to stop the disclosures. You may always contact us for assistance if you wish to later revoke your opt out election.

  
Opt Out Treatment of Joint Account Holder or Co-borrower/Guarantor

Northeast Credit Union will treat a request to opt out from any joint consumer (joint account holder, CO-borrower/guarantor) and apply the Opt Out request to everyone on the account. If a joint account holder or CO-borrower/guarantor does not want to opt out (wants information shared with nonaffiliated third parties that fall under the Opt Out definition - see attached Opt Out List) then the joint account holder or CO-borrower/guarantor may establish his/her own account as long as the requirements for that account are met.

  
How We Protect Your Information

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.
