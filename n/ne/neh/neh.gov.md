Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the NEH website and reviewing our privacy policy. Maintaining the privacy of our visitors is important to us and our privacy policy is clear. We will collect **no personal information** about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us. **NEH does not collect information for commercial or marketing purposes.**

Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website. As you can see, the information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site:

**I. Information Collected and Stored Automatically**

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does **not** identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit:

  1. The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "your school.edu" if you connect from a university) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; 
  2. The type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  3. The date and time you access our site;
  4. The pages you visit; and
  5. If you linked to the NEH website from another website, the address of that website.



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors and to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do **not** track or record information about individuals and their visits.

II. If You Send Us Personal Information

**

**** If you choose to provide us with personal information--by registering for a lecture, using the PRISM system, or sending us an e-mail comment--we use that information to register you and/or respond to your comment, as appropriate. 

**III. If You Apply Online to NEH**

Presently, only a few NEH programs accept online applications. If you apply online, we use the information you submit to determine eligibility, assist reviewers in evaluating the application, select successful applicants, and administer the award program. Some of the reviewers will be outside the agency; we will take appropriate security measures with the information that we share with them. The information otherwise would be disclosed only for a governmental purpose or as required by law. ****
