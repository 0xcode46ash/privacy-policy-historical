**Privacy Statement**

Maintaining the privacy of our users is important to us and our privacy policy is clear. We will collect **no personal information** about you when you visit our Web site unless you choose to provide that information to us.

**Personal Information**

If you provide us with information about yourself via e-mail or our Web site, your information will be used only for the purposes described at the point of collection, such as to send you information or to respond to your questions or comments. If you provide contact information, NEH staff or our contractors or partners may contact you to clarify your comment or question, or to learn about your satisfaction with our services.

We do not sell any personal information to third parties. We never collect information or create individual profiles for commercial or marketing purposes.

If you apply online to NEH programs, we use the information you submit to determine eligibility, assist reviewers in evaluating the application, select successful applicants, and administer the award program. Some of the reviewers will be outside the agency; we will take appropriate security measures with the information that we share with them. The information otherwise would be disclosed only for a governmental purpose or as required by law.

We also may share information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency. In other limited circumstances, such as responses to requests from Congress and private individuals, we may be required by law to disclose information you submit.

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are small bits of text that are either used for the duration of a session ("session cookies"), or saved on a user's hard drive in order to identify that user, or information about that user, the next time the user logs on to a Web site ("persistent cookies"). 

With the exception of videos (see below), our Web site uses session cookies. These cookies are not stored on your computer’s hard drive and are automatically erased as soon as you close your browser. We use session cookies to provide streamlined navigation throughout our site and for statistical analysis. 

For videos embedded in our Web site, a third-party video service provider sets a persistent cookie when you click to play the video. These cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive and allow the third-party provider to record and track Web sites that you have visited and which videos you have played. The third-party provider uses this information, among other things, to maintain accurate statistics of video use and to customize the video service for individual users. You can remove or block cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can still use our Web site if you do not accept the cookies; however, you may be unable to use certain cookie-dependent features. 

Further information regarding the handling of cookies is available on the third party provider’s website. The Federal Government also has guidelines for the use of persistent cookies.

**Third-party Web sites and Applications**

However, be advised that we cannot support a volume or constant update of changing external links that exceed our resources for this maintenance.

We reserve the right to review links and add or remove links at any time for any reason consistent with Federal policy or NEH guidance. Links to external Web sites may be removed if the Web sites lobby or solicit the Federal government on positions of fiscal or political nature, or if they receive funds or revenue for volume of traffic delivered from NEH to the external site where the site is not an official partner of NEH. Except for partnerships, NEH does not agree to reciprocal link arrangements.
