# Nevada Health Link Privacy Policy

                          Nevada Health Link Privacy Policy
Nevada Health Link will collect sensitive information from consumers in order to perform
Nevada Health Link functions, such as enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs) and
eligibility for advance payments of the premium tax credit (APTC) and cost sharing
reductions (CSR). Personally-identifiable consumer information (PII) and Protected Health
Information (PHI) are protected by federal law and state laws. This Privacy Policy
describes how information about covered persons or Nevada Health Link applicants may
be used, disclosed, and accessed.
What information will be collected?
Nevada Health Link will only collect the minimum information required to achieve its
mission of providing affordable health insurance to individuals and small businesses in the
State of Nevada. The information collected during the application process, enrollment,
customer support, and renewals will only be used to ensure the efficient operation of the
Nevada Health Link, verify the eligibility of an individual to enroll through Nevada Health
Link or to claim a premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction, and the amount of the
credit or reduction. This information will not be shared with any other person or entity
unless it is required to determine eligibility or to enroll in a qualified health plan.
In order to facilitate enrollment in Nevada Health Link, and to determine eligibility for
enrollment in qualified health plans (QHPs), advance payments of the premium tax credit
(APTC), and cost sharing reductions (CSR), Nevada Health Link must collect information
necessary to authenticate identity, citizenship status, residency, income, and incarceration
status. This data includes, but is not limited to:
    •   Demographic Data: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Age
    •   Income Data: Tax Filing Status, Marriage Status, Tax Dependents, Employer, Annual
        or Monthly Income
    •   Citizenship Data: Social Security Number, Resident Alien Number, Native American
        Tribe ID Number, Incarceration Status
    •   Disability Information: Whether the applicant is blind, disabled, or requires
        assistance with daily living (this information cannot be used to deny coverage, but
        may help an individual to become eligible for Medicaid)
    •   Payment Information: Credit Card Numbers, Checking Account Numbers


    •   Health Insurance Coverage Information: Past and current health insurance
        coverage, tobacco use, consumer plan selections, and other information necessary to
        facilitate enrollment.
    •   Pre-Authorizations, Current Episodic Status, Continuity of Care, etc.: For
        individuals and families enrolling in Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO)
        Transition Qualified Health Plans who were formerly enrolled in a MCO Medicaid
        Plan, pre-authorized care and prescriptions, current treatment plans, and other
        continuity of care information will be transferred between the MCO Medicaid Plan
        and that MCO’s Transition Qualified Health Plan to ensure continuity of care for this
        special population.
This information is captured during the application and enrollment process and is used
during annual open enrollments to provide an expedited enrollment experience.
To improve the Nevada Health Link portal and the overall usability of the site, some data
regarding page views, browsing behavior, and system response times may also be
collected. All personal data changes, eligibility results, plan selections, and any other action
performed by the user will be tracked for audit and appeals purposes.
Each interaction between an individual and Nevada Health Link or the Customer Contact
Center will also be documented along with any communications, notifications, or emails.
The primary purpose of recording this information is to help improve the efficiency of the
Customer Service Center, Nevada Health Link Operations, and to support the appeals
process.
What other parties will have access to my information?
Nevada Health Link will only share information with insurance carriers, and state and
federal agencies as required to process requests for enrollment in QHP’s and to determine
eligibility for health coverage, advance payments of the premium tax credit, and cost
sharing reductions. The following table outlines the entities Nevada Health Link will share
data with, and how that data is used. All entities that receive data from Nevada Health Link
are required to support the same level of data security standards as Nevada Health Link
itself.

How do I know my information will be protected?
Information collected by Nevada Health Link during the enrollment process is protected by
several federal and state laws, including provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act (PPACA), IRS Code, and Nevada regulations. In addition, Nevada Health Link has
policies and procedures in place to ensure information security and privacy. The following
laws and guidelines are important safeguards in the protection of information shared with
the Nevada Health Link:


45 CFR § 155.260 states that Nevada Health Link may only use PII to determine eligibility
for enrollment in qualified health plans, to determine eligibility for Medicaid and the
Children’s Health Insurance Program, and to determine eligibility for exemptions from the
individual mandate to maintain health insurance coverage. Nevada Health Link will fully
comply with this federal regulation. Nevada Health Link will not create, collect, use or
disclose personally identifiable information for any purposes that are not authorized under
this regulation. 1 The following principles are outlined in the regulation:
     •   Individual Access: Individuals will be provided with a simple and timely means to
         access and obtain their personally identifiable health information
     •   Correction: Individuals will be provided with a timely means to dispute the
         accuracy of their personally identifiable health information and to have erroneous
         information corrected
     •   Openness and transparency: All policies, procedures, and technologies that affect
         individuals and their personally identifiable information are fully disclosed to the
         public
     •   Individual choice: Individuals will be provided a reasonable opportunity and
         capability to make informed decisions about the collection, use, and disclosure of
         their personally identifiable health information
     •   Collection, use, and disclosure limitations: Personally identifiable health
         information will be created, collected, used, and/or disclosed only to the extent
         necessary to accomplish the goals of Nevada Health Link
     •   Data quality and integrity: Persons and entities will take reasonable steps to
         ensure that personally identifiable health information is complete, accurate, and up-
         to-date to the extent necessary to provide services to the members of Nevada Health
         Link
     •   Safeguards: Personally identifiable health information is protected with reasonable
         operational, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to ensure its
         confidentiality, integrity, and availability and to prevent unauthorized access, use, or
         disclosure
1 45 CFR § 155.260


     •    Accountability: These principles are implemented, and adherence assured, through
          independent security audits by a third party.
Nevada Health Link will maintain operational, technical, administrative and physical
safeguards
Consistent with all applicable laws and regulations, Nevada Health Link will ensure that all
information is protected through effective administrative and operational procedures
maintained by Nevada Health Link.
     •    Nevada Health Link will ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of all
          personally identifiable information that is created, collected, used, or disclosed by
          Nevada Health Link.
     •    Personally identifiable information will be used by, or disclosed to, only those
          authorized to receive or view it. PPACA section 1411 states that “an applicant for
          insurance coverage or for a premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction shall be
          required to provide only the information strictly necessary to authenticate identity,
          determine eligibility, and determine the amount of the credit or reduction.” It also
          states that this information must be used only for Nevada Health Link operations
          (such as verification of eligibility for enrollment, cost-sharing reduction, or premium
          tax credit). Penalties of up to $25,000 per violation exist for anyone who knowingly
          and willfully violates this restriction. 2
     •    Tax return information will be kept confidential in accordance with section 6103 of
          the Internal Revenue Code. The IRS will disclose certain available items of federal
          tax return information to the Data Services Hub after an individual submits an
          application for financial assistance in obtaining health coverage with Nevada Health
          Link or state agencies that administer Medicaid, CHIP, or basic health plans. The
          items that will be disclosed through the Data Services Hub are described under
          Internal Revenue Code section 6103(l)(21)(A) and the regulations issued under that
          section. Internal Revenue Code section 6103 protects the confidentiality of federal
          tax return information. 3 Disclosure of federal tax return information to the U.S.
          Department of Health and Human Services is allowed in order to implement
          eligibility determinations for health insurance affordability programs, within the
          confidentiality requirements in Internal Revenue Code section 6103.4
2 PPACA § 1411(g)
3 26 CFR § 301.6103(l)(21)(A)
4 26 CFR § 301.6103(l)(21)(A)


     •   Personally identifiable information will be protected against any reasonably
         anticipated threats or hazards to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
         such information.
     •   Personally identifiable information will be protected against any reasonably
         anticipated uses or disclosures that are not permitted or required by law.
     •   Personally identifiable information will be securely destroyed or disposed of in an
         appropriate and reasonable manner and in accordance with retention schedules.
Nevada Health Link will maintain appropriate security controls
     •   Nevada Health Link will ensure that its workforce complies with all information
         safeguards and security controls.
     •   Nevada Health Link will monitor, periodically assess, and update security controls
         to ensure the continued effectiveness of those controls.
     •   Nevada Health Link will require, as a condition of contracts and agreements, the
         same or more stringent privacy and security standards and controls to Navigators,
         agents, brokers or other contractors authorized to access any personally identifiable
         information.
     •   Nevada Health Link will use secure electronic interfaces when sharing personally
         identifiable information electronically. PPACA section 1413 requires the
         establishment of secure electronic interfaces with state health subsidy programs
         allowing the Nevada Health Link of data consistent with privacy and security
         standards in section 1942 of the Social Security Act. Nevada Health Link will ensure
         that all data matching and data sharing arrangements between Nevada Health Link
         and agencies administering the Medicaid and Children’s Health Insurance Program
         meet all requirements applicable to Nevada Health Link as well as all requirements
         applicable under Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. 5
