# Privacy Policy | Neverblue

### Introduction

This Privacy Policy sets out the policies and practices of Neverblue Media Company Limited, including its business unit, PulseMobile (collectively, “we” or “our”), with respect to personal information collected from visitors to either of our websites, [www.neverblue.com](http://www.neverblue.com/) and [www.pulsemobile.com](http://www.pulsemobile.com/) (collectively, the “Sites”).

It is developed in compliance with Canada’s  _Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act_ (PIPEDA) and British Columbia’s  _Personal Information Protection Act_  (PIPA). These Acts set out rules for how organizations such as ours can collect, use and disclose your personal information.

### What is Personal Information?

In this Privacy Policy, personal information means information about an identifiable individual, such as someone’s name, address, social insurance number, income or family status, as defined under applicable Canadian laws. 

Personal Information does not include information that is not personally identifiable, such as anonymous session cookies, browser settings or general IP locations (“Anonymous Information”).

### Collection and Use of Personal Information

We collect only what you expressly and voluntarily provide to us through a form on the Sites. This can include your name, phone number, email address and, if applicable, any comments you choose to make (collectively, your “Personal Information”).

We use this information only as necessary to contact you for the purpose of responding to your request to book a meeting.

We keep your Personal Information only as long as necessary for the purpose outlined above or as required or permitted by law.

### Collection and Use of Anonymous Information

When you visit our Sites, we automatically record certain Anonymous Information that your browser sends whenever you visit any website. If your browser settings permit, we collect the following:

  * browser information, including preferred language, operating system, internet service provider, platform and screen resolutions;
  * information about IP country and region; and
  * default session cookies that expire on browser close and cookies to track sessions over a period of two years, at which time they expire automatically (“Cookies”).



We do not collect IP addresses, only general geographic information, and our Cookies do not collect any specific credentials or data. We do not associate any of the foregoing Anonymous Information with specific individuals or any Personal Information.

We collect this Anonymous Information for the purpose of better understanding who is accessing our Sites and how they are doing so. We use it to distinguish unique users and see broad demographic information, as well as patterns in how users navigate through our Sites. 

### Disclosure and Security

Our network is protected by industry standard firewall and password protection and we have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of data under our control. 

We will not disclose or otherwise transfer your Personal information except as set out here, with consent, or where authorized or required by law, including, for example, in response to a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

Personal Information you submit on our Sites is stored in a secure database located in the United States and managed by a third-party service provider (the “Database Manager”). Such information is subject to United States laws, including those governing access to personal information.

The Database Manager is obligated to maintain confidentiality and security of Personal Information under its control. It is not authorized to use such information for any purpose other than to ensure that the information is stored securely.  Note, however, that we shall not be liable for any action or inaction by the Database Manager.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy at our discretion by giving reasonable notice of the revised terms, including by posting on the Sites.  When we do, we will revise the effective date at the bottom of this page.   

By using our Sites, you indicate your acceptance of this Privacy Policy.
