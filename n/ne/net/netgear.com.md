**NETGEAR PRIVACY POLICY FOR CUSTOMERS**  
Maintaining customer privacy is important to NETGEAR. The following information is available to help you understand how NETGEAR protects customer information.

 **Our Principles.**  
NETGEAR adheres to industry-standard privacy principles with respect to our customer information:

  * Notice - NETGEAR is committed to making our customers aware of our Privacy Policy.
  * Choice - NETGEAR provides customers with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mail offers.



 **NETGEAR's Overall Philosophy**

NETGEAR will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the applicable laws.

 **What We Collect and How We Use It**  
NETGEAR collects various customer information, including customer contact information, at various places on our website, including when a customer signs up for our mailing list, registers a product, or requests a whitepaper.

Any time a customer receives a special offer from NETGEAR via e-mail, they are provided with a link where they can choose to unsubscribe from NETGEAR's list. Customers can subscribe or re-subscribe to our mailing list, when they visit the NETGEAR website and provide the necessary information under our Community Registration.
