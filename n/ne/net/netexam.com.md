****PRIVACY POLICY – UPDATED JANUARY 2017**

Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our website and services (collectively, “Media Defined” or “Website”).

Media Defined complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland.  Media Defined has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.  Additional information regarding the Safe Harbor program, and Media Defined’s certification can be found at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/

By visiting or using any part of this Website, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as they may be amended from time to time. As we update and expand our Website, this Privacy Policy may change, so please check this web page for updates to our Privacy Policy. Furthermore, this Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is a part of, this Website’s Terms of Use agreement, which also governs your use of this Website.

**Collection of information**

When you visit our Website, we may collect information regarding your visit from your computer. Such information helps us to determine information about how you found our Website, the date that you visited our Website and search engines that may have led you to our Website. We collect this information in order to continually improve and enhance the functionality of Media Defined.

The information you may provide us with is classified into two general types (user-provided information and website usage information), both of which are discussed in greater detail below.

**Personal information you choose to provide**

In order to make your visits to our Website as enjoyable as possible, we may ask you for Personal Information. Personal information includes, for example, your name and e-mail address, both of which you may be asked to provide when registering with Media Defined. A description of some of the ways that you may provide personal information to us, as well as further details on how we may use such personal information, is given below.

  1. **Contact us/feedback**



If you e-mail us through a “Contact us” link on our Website, we may ask you for information such as your name and e-mail address so that we can respond to your questions and comments.

In certain cases, and with your permission, we may post content from your e-mails to us on the Website.

  2. **Questionnaires and surveys**



We may occasionally ask viewers of our Website to complete online surveys and opinion polls about their activities, attitudes and interests. These surveys help us serve you better and improve the usefulness of Media Defined. When requesting your participation in these surveys, we may ask you to provide us with your name and e-mail address.

  3. **Bulletin Boards**



Our Website may offer its users the opportunity to use bulletin board blogs and chat rooms and to engage in discussions with other users.

Our servers automatically collect data about your Internet Protocol address when you visit us.
