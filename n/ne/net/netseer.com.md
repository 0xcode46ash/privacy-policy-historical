# Privacy policy | NetSeer

#### LAST UPDATED: OCTOBER 27, 2014

#### GENERAL

NetSeer, Inc. (“NetSeer”) takes matters of privacy very seriously. We’re in the business of improving the online experience for consumers by delivering more relevant advertising on behalf of our advertiser and publisher Clients (“Clients”), which means we may employ the use of various types of data. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) is designed to inform consumers about how our technology collects and uses data in the course of business, and on our corporate website (“Website”), [www.netseer.com](http://www.netseer.com/). By visiting our Website, You (“You”) are accepting the practices that we’ve outlined as part of our Policy.

#### We follow the best practices in the industry

We’ve designed our policy to make sure You have a clear idea of how information is, and is not, used both for our Clients’ sites, and our own Website. Here’s what You need to know:

#### Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information (“PII”) is data that identifies You personally, such as your name, address, telephone number, email address, or birth date. We do not collect PII from Client websites via our ad servers or technology. We do, however, collect any data that You choose to share with us on our Website, such as signing up for newsletters or opting in to receive information from NetSeer.

#### Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“NPII”) refers to information that cannot be used to identify a specific person. Examples of NPII includes things such as your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, the type of Web browser you use, the operating system you use (such as Windows or Macintosh), and webpages you may have visited. We collect NPII when you visit the NetSeer.com Website, or the websites of our Clients. This is captured via a standard “cookie”, which is used by nearly every website today. A cookie is a small text file made up of alphanumeric characters. Cookies, however, do not collect or transmit PII.

#### How we use NPII

We use NPII for three basic purposes. The first is to “frequency cap” ad campaigns that we administer. Frequency capping controls the number of times You are exposed to an ad, which results in a better experience for You and the advertiser. The second way we use NPII is to serve appropriate promotions from advertisers if You have expressed an implied interest by visiting that advertiser’s site (known as “retargeting”).The third way is for Interest-Based Advertising (IBA), which uses consumer data from the ad exchanges to infer intent. NetSeer retains this data for 60 days, after which the data is aggregated and maintained for an additional two years solely for reporting purposes. While we also use NPII in a limited fashion for the administration and operation of our Site, it used primarily to improve the overall quality of experience with the information we provide on our Site. We do not share user-level data with third parties and only aggregate data is shared for reporting purposes.

#### It’s your choice to opt-out

If You would like to opt-out of NPII-based retargeting, please return to our homepage at [www.netseer.com](http://www.netseer.com/) and click on the “Opt out” button at the bottom of the page in the footer. Upon clicking “Opt out,” NetSeer will place an opt-out cookie on your browser. The opt-out cookie means You will not be retargeted by ads served through NetSeer’s media platform. If You delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if You use a different computer, mobile device or Internet browser, You may need to renew this opt-out choice. However, if You do choose to opt-in, NetSeer will delete the opt-out cookie and You may again be retargeted with relevant advertisement based on your visits to websites of our advertising clients.

#### Compliance with the Network Advertising Initiative

NetSeer adheres to the Code and is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) – a coalition of more than 90 leading online advertising companies championing the responsible and transparent use of information for Interest-Based Advertising. Since 2000, the NAI has been working with the leaders in online advertising to build consumer awareness and to reinforce responsible business and data management practices and standards. NetSeer will sometimes use third-party data providers to complement our product offerings, and some of these companies are also fellow members of the NAI. For more information on the NAI, or to opt out of behavioral targeting delivered by NAI member companies, please visit [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/).

NetSeer does not build and supply customers with any sort of custom segments. Nor does NetSeer engage in retargeting campaigns that market prescription drugs. However, NetSeer may offer retargeting services for consumer health products that do not require a prescription. Examples of where retargeting might be offered include certain health categories such as fitness equipment, calorie counters, etc.
