**PRIVACY POLICY **

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes NetSeer Inc.'s ("NetSeer") collection and use of personal information from Internet users visiting the NetSeer website located at NetSeer.com and other sites owned and operated by NetSeer (collectively, the "Site").  By using the Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Policy and agree to accept the terms of the Policy as currently posted on the Site.  Any changes to this Policy will be effective upon posting. If you have any questions about this Policy, please contact NetSeer at privacy@netseer.com. 

1. INFORMATION COLLECTED

Personally identifiable information ("PII") is data that identifies a specific individual, such as name, address, telephone number, email address, and birth date.  NetSeer does not collect PII.

NetSeer's web servers automatically collect non-personally identifiable information ("NPII") about Site visitors, such as demographic information (age, gender, city or state), and "click stream data." Click stream data includes information such as a Site visitor's IP address, web pages viewed as well as date and time, and browser and platform type. These automated server functions do not collect this information in a manner intended to identify a Site visitor. 

NetSeer uses a common Internet technology called "cookies" to collect NPII about Site visitors. A cookie is a small text file written to an Internet user's browser that contains unique information about the Internet user. Cookies permit the Site to recall information from a Site visitor's previous visits and customize the Site for the visitor's future use. Cookies do not collect or transmit PII. 

You may opt-out of our services at anytime by either disabling cookies in your browser preferences or by clicking here:

We use NPII for a variety of purposes, including the administration and operation of the Site, designing and developing new products and services, and generally improving the overall quality of your experience with the Site and NetSeer services. 

3. THIRD PARTY WEBSITES

The Site may include links to other sites that are controlled by parties other than NetSeer. NetSeer does not control the data collection policies of any website linked to the Site and no third-party sites are covered by this Policy. Site visitors choosing to access such third-party websites should carefully review the individual privacy policies governing any such websites.
