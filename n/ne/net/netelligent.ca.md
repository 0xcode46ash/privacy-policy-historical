eStruxture Data Centers Inc. and its affiliates ("eStruxture") are committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information which you may provide to us or we may obtain in the course of your relationship with us. This eStruxture privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") describes the type of personal information we collect, the manner in which we do so and how we treat it, consistent with our commitment to providing you with a satisfying and helpful shopping experience. 

Our Privacy Policy is designed to comply with applicable privacy acts and applies to our company sales, our web sites (the "Site", currently at: http://www.eStruxture.com/), and all other channels in which eStruxture collects and uses your personal information. Our Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. 

### 2\. What is Personal Information?

Personal information is information that refers to an individual specifically and is recorded in any form and includes such things as age, income, date of birth, e-mail and postal addresses, telephone numbers, financial information, credit reports as well as preferences and order history (the "Personal Information").

### 3\. How is Personal Information Collected?

Personal Information may be collected when you make a purchase, subscribe to our services or provide us with any Personal Information. Personal Information may also be collected online when you make a purchase, subscribe to our services, apply for credit, voluntarily register with us or update your existing profile, receive newsletters or emails, use communication services, answer surveys, enter contests or other promotional opportunities or make other submissions to our Site. We may also collect Personal Information from third parties to whom you have provided same.

### 4\. Why we collect Personal Information

We use Personal Information in an effort to improve our services, to communicate with you about our products, promotions or contests, to protect you and us from error and fraud, to process your requests or orders and to keep track of and analyze your purchases, transactions, account activity, payment history and to assess your credit-worthiness. We may also use this information to make offers to you, to help us target specific products to you, and to help us develop and improve our offerings and tailor them to your interests.

We do not sell or rent our customers' Personal Information to any other party. However, we may share some of your personal information in the normal course of business within our corporate family or we may transfer your Personal Information to third party service providers who assist us in serving you, such as vendors, suppliers and agents; however, we require them to protect your information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy. Our service providers may be located outside of Canada and may be required to disclose personal information under the laws of their jurisdiction.

### 5\. Consent

We will collect, use or disclose your Personal Information with your knowledge and consent, including as set out in the Privacy Policy, except where otherwise required or permitted by law. The method of obtaining consent depends on the circumstances and may be oral or written, express or implied. Implied consent is obtained in a number of ways, including where a customer relationship already exists, express consent has previously been given, or the purpose of using the Personal Information is reasonably apparent to you.

The law permits or requires that we collect, use or share your Personal Information in certain circumstances without your consent, including, for example, to investigate a breach of an agreement or a law or in response to a search warrant, to realize on security pledged for a loan, or to investigate or deter fraud.

You may change or withdraw your consent at any time, on reasonable notice, subject to legal or contractual restrictions. We will inform you of the implications of doing so. In order to change or withdraw your consent, please refer to the Contacting Us section below.

### 6\. Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention

Personal Information will not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with your consent or as required or permitted by law. Personal Information will be retained only as long as necessary for those purposes or as permitted by law. 

### 7\. Accuracy

We will keep your Personal Information as accurate, complete and up-to-date as necessary and reasonably possible for the purposes for which it is to be used. You may request access to any Personal Information we have on record in order to review and amend the information, as appropriate. In circumstances where your Personal Information has been provided by a third party, we will refer you to that party (e.g. credit bureaus). 

### 8\. Safeguards and Accountability

We will protect your Personal Information with appropriate security safeguards and safety measures, whether recorded on paper or captured electronically, against unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse. For example, electronic records are stored in secure, limited-access servers; we employ technological tools like firewalls and passwords; and we ensure our employees are trained on the importance of maintaining the security and confidentiality of Personal Information.

We are responsible for Personal Information under our control, including any Personal Information that is transferred to third parties for processing, storage or other purposes. We review our procedures and security measures regularly to ensure that they are properly administered and remain effective and appropriate for the sensitivity of the information.

### 9\. Openness and Individual Access

This Policy and any related information are available at all times on request.

Should you so request, we will, within a reasonable delay, inform you of the existence, use and disclosure of Personal Information relating to you, and give you access to that information, unless prohibited by law.
