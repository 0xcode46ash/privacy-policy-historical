**Information That We Collect and Use**     
We collect personal information from you when you register with the NOW™ (NetApp on the Web) site and when you request information from us about product and services. Registration with NOW gives you access to our support site, online communities, NetApp® Field Portal, and NetApp University, depending on your interests and level of authorization. Examples of personal information are name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, company name, and so on. For a complete list of all data elements that we collect and the use of those data elements, contact us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com).

We collect personal data about those who communicate with us such as e-mail address, user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and site registrations. This information is used to personalize our communications with you about products that are specific to your needs and interests. Rather than burden you with information that is not relevant or of interest to you, we try to target information that is specifically important to you. No personal data is collected, used, accessed, stored, or distributed without your explicit authorization. At any time, even after you have given authorization, you can opt out of receiving these communications by contacting us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com).

We use the information that we collect to improve the content of our Web pages by incorporating information that is relevant to our clients, to notify customers about updates to our Web site, to contact customers for marketing purposes that are related specifically to their needs and interests, and to track applicants for career opportunities. This information is not shared with other organizations for any reason, commercial or business, without your prior explicit consent.

If you browse and/or apply for jobs in the Careers portion of our Web site, your application and any additional information that you provide may be used to assess your skills and interests against career opportunities at NetApp, and for reporting purposes as may be required by U.S. law. This usage is covered in the initial authorization that you provide to NetApp. When you access our Applicant Tracking System, you are asked to provide your authorization for us to collect, use, process, store, and distribute your personal data before you enter any personal data. We use your information to communicate with you and to inform you of career opportunities.

NetApp does use third-party entities to provide valuable services on our behalf. To provide these services to you, we need your explicit consent to share your personal data with them. Third parties with which we share your information are bound by all relevant data privacy laws, terms of confidentiality, and this privacy policy. For a complete list of these third parties and the services they provide, contact us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com).

NetApp supplements the data it collects with additional data received from third-party sources, by using data append services. The additional supplemental data consists of contact, company, and industry data, as well as title, department, address, phone number, and updated e-mail addresses. For additional information about supplemental data and the third-party sources, contact us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com).

If you use communities, blogs, or chat rooms on NetApp Web sites, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, and used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. NetApp is not responsible for the personally identifiable information that you choose to submit in these forums, unless it was released by NetApp without your consent.

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name, but not the e-mail address.

**Internal Company Directory**     
On our support site, users can access an internal company directory of all individuals in their organization. Users can opt out of being part of this directory by contacting us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com). If you would like a testimonial posted in the directory, please indicate whether or not you want your personal data to appear with the testimonial.

**Third-Party Technical Support**     
NetApp uses the services of third parties to provide technical support services, including customer and field support. IBM Global Services and other third parties provide these services, based on the customer’s specific requirements. For a complete list of our third-party providers, contact [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com). Per our terms and agreements, all third-party providers are required to comply with all relevant country-specific data privacy laws.

**Tell a Friend, Import Contacts**     
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we ask you for your friend’s name and e-mail address. You may supply that information only if you have the consent of the individual whose name and e-mail address you are providing. (NetApp highly recommends that you provide your friend with our contact information and ask that they contact us directly.) NetApp automatically sends your friend a one-time e-mail message inviting him or her to visit the site. We do not store this information. We also use a service provider, Clickability, through which you can sign up, add contacts, import addresses, and send e-mails. This information is not collected by NetApp or by the service provider.

**Log Files**     
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring and exit pages, operating system, date and time stamp, and clickstream data. This data is not considered personal data because it does not identify individual users. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

**Cookies**     
Propensity management is the management of an individual’s inclination or natural tendency toward certain interests, products, needs, and so on. In order to tailor our communications with you to make sure that we are addressing your specific needs and not overwhelming you with unwanted information, we use cookies to handle propensity management. A cookie is a piece of information that is stored on your computer's hard drive by your Web browser. When you revisit [www.netapp.com](http://www.netapp.com/), our server recognizes the cookie, giving us information about your last visit. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can alter the settings of your browser to prevent automatic acceptance. If you choose not to receive cookies, you can still use most of the features of our Web site, including purchasing items.

This privacy statement covers the use of propensity management by this site only and does not cover the use of propensity management by any advertisers. We work with companies, such as Omniture, that use third-party cookies and Web beacons to collect anonymous information that helps us measure and improve our content and advertising effectiveness. Omniture collects and analyzes anonymous usage and volume statistical information from our users. This data is collected only in aggregate form.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons, Web Bugs)**     
We employ a software technology called _clear gifs_ (also known as Web beacons or Web bugs) that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, that are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs, which are about the size of a period, are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

**Legal Disclaimer**     
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our legal rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

We use third parties to provide services on our site such as an e-mail service providers, Web content delivery providers, chat providers, community platform providers, Web employment opportunity providers, product training providers, and sales lead tracking providers. When you sign up for these services, we share your personal information with the third party as necessary to provide that service. For a complete list of these service providers and the services they perform on behalf of NetApp, contact us at [privacy@netapp.com](mailto:privacy@netapp.com).

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

**Links to Other Sites**     
NetApp Web sites contain links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by NetApp. Although we do not share your personal data with these other sites, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by NetApp Web sites.

**Security**     
The security of your personal data is important to us. When you enter personal data on the NOW registration site, we encrypt that information by using secure socket layer (SSL) technology.

We follow generally accepted industry standards such as firewalls and encryption and data privacy legal requirements to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, although we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**     
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy page, to the NetApp homepage, and to other places that we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, who has access to it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
