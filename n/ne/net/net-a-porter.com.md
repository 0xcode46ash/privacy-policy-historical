  * What Personal Information do we collect from you and how we use it

NET-A-PORTER collects personal information in several ways when you place an order, buy a gift voucher for a friend or register for a service offered by NET-A-PORTER. By registering, you are consenting to the collection of your personal data. If an order is placed with us, we need to hold personal information including your name, email address, phone numbers, home address, shipping and credit/debit card billing address(es) so that we can process and fulfill your order.

Saved card details will never be shared with third parties and will only be used to process your order, using our payment partner's systems. Additionally we may also obtain information as a result of authentication or identity checks. Sometimes we may ask for your telephone number. This number may be given to our courier for delivery services. These details allow us to process your order and to let you know the status of your order. 

Users of NET-A-PORTER TV will only have their name and email address processed in order to provide the service and respond to any complaints or otherwise where required by law on in connection with any legal proceedings or dispute. 

In addition, our Live Chat provider stores all chat conversations for 13 months. These transcripts are only accessed by NET-A-PORTER for training purposes so we can enhance the service we provide. To receive a copy of your chat conversation simply request this when exiting Live Chat or contact our customer care team by emailing [customercare.usa@net-a-porter.com](mailto:customercare.usa@net-a-porter.com).
