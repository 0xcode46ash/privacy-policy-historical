This privacy statement covers the privacy and information sharing practices of NetQuote, including: 

•          what information of yours is collected; 

•          who is collecting the information; 

•          how the information will be used; 

•          with whom the information may be shared; 

•          what your choices are regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; and

**What information do you collect about me?**

We collect three basic types of information – personally identifiable information, non-personally identifiable information and technical information. 

_Personally Identifiable Information_.  We collect information about you to quote and service your insurance policy.  This is often called personally identifiable information if it identifies you and is not generally available to the public.  You provide personally identifiable information on your application, through your agent or broker, by phone, or online.  It may include your name, street and e-mail addresses, phone number, driver’s license number, Social Security number, date of birth, gender, marital status, type of vehicle, and personally identifiable information about other drivers who may be included on your insurance policy. 

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information_.  We may also collect certain non-personally identifiable information from your use of our Web site, such as usage activity and preferences.  We may share site usage activity and/or aggregated statistical information from our database with insurance providers or business partners (for example, the percentage of our users that are over 50 years old).  Even in these cases, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed. 

_Technical Information_. This information is unique to Internet transactions.  It includes the Web site that linked you to ours, your computer operating system, and the pages you viewed on our site.  Our Web site may also store “cookies” on your computer.  Cookies save certain non-personally identifiable information you enter on our Web site.  They also collect technical information, like your Internet protocol (IP) address, the type of operating system you are using, and session ID.  We may also use other technology (e.g., tracker GIFs) designed to enhance the functionality of our Web site and to make your transactions and other activities more convenient and efficient.  While these technologies vary, in some cases they may store a small file on the computer you are using to access our Web site.  We only use this technology to collect and store information relating to your viewing and use of our Web site and our correspondences with you.  You may set your Web browser software not to accept cookies, but, if so, the functionality of our site will be affected.  We may collect your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site and identify our users.  We may also use such technologies to remember user preferences or minimize the need for you to re-enter information. 

Third parties (including, but not limited to, software vendors, advertisers and fulfillment companies) may also use the above technologies by or through our Web site.  We have no control over what information such third parties track or collect, and we have no responsibility or liability for any tracking, data collection or other activities of such third parties.  ****

**How does NetQuote use your personally identifiable information?**

We use your personally identifiable information to create your insurance profile.  From this profile, we generate quote requests to our participating insurance companies.  If you meet their criteria, participating insurance companies and insurance representatives (collectively, “ _Insurance Providers_ ”) may provide you with an offline quote. 

Unless you give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we will not willfully use or disclose your personally identifiable information. 

**How do NetQuote’s Insurance Providers or other third parties use your information?**

We cannot control the privacy practices of Insurance Providers.  However, all the Insurance Providers should only use the information you submit to us for the purpose of providing you with an accurate insurance quote.  Insurance Providers use your personally identifiable information in combination with other information you submit about your insurance needs.  Rating criteria may be different for each participating Insurance Provider and each Insurance Provider may place different emphasis on particular aspects of your information. 

NetQuote also contracts with certain partners that utilize ad-serving technology offered by various companies.  To gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements, these companies may place a cookie on your computer when you view Web pages where these ads appear, or when you click on the ads.  These third-party cookies enable the companies to recognize certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor’s IP address, browser version type, operating system, Internet service provider, and time zone.  Although the information collected using these cookies does not directly recognize your personally identifiable information, these third parties may be able to associate the cookie information with your personally identifiable information if you registered for a product or service on their site.  We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these third party sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**Do we send your information to Insurance Providers? Do you have control over this?**

Yes, by clicking the “Submit My Request” button on the final page of our application screens, you are requesting that insurance companies subscribing to the NetQuote service contact you via email, telephone or fax, using the information you have supplied, to provide quotes for insurance products or services or to obtain additional information needed to provide quotes. This information is only sent at your direction. 

**Does NetQuote store your information?**

Yes. All information submitted through our quote request forms is stored on our computer servers.  We do not use your personally identifiable information except or with your permission: 

•          to forward it to Insurance Providers, 

•          to save it to your NetQuote Account, and 

•          to send you e-mail, including consumer surveys, as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**After you request quotes at NetQuote, who will contact you?**

After you submit your information to NetQuote by clicking the “Submit My Request” button on the final page of our application screens Representatives of Insurance Providers enrolled in the NetQuote service should contact you with information regarding your quotes, coverage, or insurance needs.  In addition to NetQuote e-mailing you a quote confirmation, NetQuote will occasionally e-mail a quality control survey to all customers who request quotes or coverage.  These surveys are optional.  While we may review individual survey responses as well as the aggregated results, none of the surveys are associated with personally identifiable information.  Additionally, NetQuote does not disclose or share survey responses with any third party. 

**Does NetQuote sell your information to other companies?**

No, we never resell, trade, lease or rent our users’ personally identifiable information to other companies other than participating Insurance Providers. 

**Does NetQuote send e-mails or other promotional material?**

When you save your information at our site you will be given the opportunity to receive further information from NetQuote.  Our communications are usually delivered to our customers via e-mail.  Your e-mail address may be provided to a trustworthy third party solely for this purpose.  Our customers generally find the information helpful. 

**Opt-Out**

If you would like to opt not to receive promotional or marketing material from us in the future, please submit your email address at  <http://extranet.netquote.com/MarketingMedia/optout.html>.  However, your option not to receive promotional and marketing material: (a) will not stop our correspondence with you, by e-mail or otherwise, regarding your existing or past relationship with us (e.g., your pending or past applications or our responses to questions or inquiries you pose to us), and (b) will not stop us, including our employees, contractors, agents and other representatives, from accessing and viewing your personal information in the course of maintaining and improving the Site. 

If you have completed the quote information page by entering your contact information, you will occasionally receive information from us about your quotes (although you may not have saved your information). 

If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving email advertisements from NetQuote, you can either follow the instructions in the advertisement.  Please note that it may take up to 10 days to process your request. 

**What do sites that have links from NetQuote do with your information?**

Please be aware that Web sites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you.  When you click on one of these links, you are being transferred to another website.  We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these linked sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours.  This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of Web sites linked to the NetQuote site. 

**How does NetQuote protect your information as it passes over the Internet?**

With SSL, when you enter a request for quotes or provide personal information, your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our computer servers.  To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser.  We recommend using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser.  Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are 128-bit browsers.  You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen.  If you are using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key.  When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server. 

When you agree to send information, we transmit your information to the company you select.  We offer encryption to each of our participating insurance companies.  We require encryption when transmitting information such as Social Security numbers or credit card information.

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

NetQuote may make significant changes to its privacy policy affecting the use of the personal information collected.  We will notify you by e-mail of any relevant changes.  However, if you have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated your account, then you will not be contacted, nor will your personal information be used in this new manner.  When we notify you, you will be able to opt out of this information usage by submitting your email address at  <http://extranet.netquote.com/MarketingMedia/optout.html>.  You should also check this posted privacy statement for changes.
