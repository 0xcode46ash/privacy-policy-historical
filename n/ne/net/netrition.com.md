### Privacy Statement for Netrition

Netrition, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following statements disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 

Netrition, Inc. does not sell, trade, rent, or give your personal information to others except what is necessary to process an order. 

We may use your IP address (a network identification number) to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

Our site uses Cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and user preferences. We also may use Cookies to deliver content specific to your interests. 

Our site uses an ordering system for customers to request products. We collect visitor's contact information (like their name, address, phone number and email address) and payment information (like their credit card numbers). Contact information from the ordering system is used to send orders and - if you choose to join our email mailing list(s) - information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below. Payment information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. 

This site contains links to other sites. **Netrition, Inc.** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

#### Security

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) which is the industry-standard encryption scheme to scramble data so it can be transmitted securely to us. We perform periodic security scans of computer systems responsible for the processing of customer information. 

#### Choice/Opt-Out

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving email from us from within emails sent from our mailing list. Each email contains a link to uniquely remove the recipient's email address from the mailing list. 

#### Google Analytics

Netrition uses Google Analytics, Google Analytics for Display Advertising, and Google Analytics/Adwords Remarketing to market our site across the web. Google Analytics collects information anonymously and reports website trends without identifying individual visitors. Google Analytics uses its own cookie to track visitor interactions. As a website owner, Netrition can view a variety of reports about how visitors interact with our website so we can improve our website and how people find it. For Remarketing, a cookie is placed on your browser, and then a 3rd party reads these cookies and may serve an ad on a 3rd party site. More information on Google Analytics can be found at: [www.google.com/analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics), [www.google.com/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/privacy.html) and [www.google.com/analytics/tos.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html).
