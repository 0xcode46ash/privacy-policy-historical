**Information We Collect**

**IP Address**  
The netLibrary Web site logs IP addresses for system administration purposes. Your IP address can help us diagnose problems with our server and track a user’s session to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. In addition, we track system information, such as the type of browser you are using, your operating system, and the referring IP address. We use this information in aggregate only; we do not link IP addresses to any personal identifiers. 

**Cookies**  
netLibrary uses a feature of your browser called a cookie to store your member ID and state information about where you are in the site. netLibrary uses cookies to keep track of where you are in the site since the Internet is a stateless environment, but many of netLibrary's functions, such as moving from one page to the next in a book, require state. netLibrary does not store any of your personal information in cookies. A cookie is simply a small data file that the Web site writes to your hard drive. A cookie can’t read any other data off your hard drive, pass on a virus, or read cookie files created by other sites. 

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. netLibrary will not operate properly without cookies enabled. 

**Registration**  
A significant amount of the site is available without registration, but in order to take advantage of some features of netLibrary, you must register and create a member account. The netLibrary online registration form requires you to provide your full name, e-mail address, ZIP code, a User Name, and password. All other registration information, such as your age, address, phone number, and employer, is optional and is marked as such. We hope that, like many netLibrary users, you will want to provide information about yourself so that we can continue to make our Web site more valuable to you. 

For certain contests, surveys, or chat forums, we may ask you to provide additional information about yourself. Participation in these enhanced services is completely optional. 

If you choose to purchase additional products or services from netLibrary, we will collect your billing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date. Occasionally, our publishers request that we provide the name of all eBook purchasers along with the items purchased. The purchase of eBooks may imply consent to providing that information. 

**Recommend to a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our "Recommend to a friend" service for informing a friend about eBooks offered by netLibrary, we ask them for both their email address the friend's email address. netLibrary will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site but does not store these email addresses for future use. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that netLibrary is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Usage**  
As you interact with netLibrary, your usage patterns are logged anonymously. This tells us if you searched to find information and what searches you used. We also log whether or not your searches were successful and what subject areas you visited. The logs use your session ID only, they do not connect with your specific member ID. Usage data is viewed and analyzed in aggregated form only. 

**Circulation Records**  
While you are viewing an eBook in netLibrary, or while you have an eBook checked out, the system has to be able to recognize you to know if you have access rights to that eBook. However, we do not keep any long-term circulation records. It is not possible to view a history of what publications an individual has used. We do keep track of any eBooks that you personally may purchase so that the system can recognize you as the owner and person authorized to access them.
