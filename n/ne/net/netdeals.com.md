**PlazaDirect Privacy Commitment**

PlazaDirect.com respects the sensitive nature of the information you provide to us. Our Privacy Policy is designed to maximize your ability to protect your personal information while giving you the opportunity to participate in our sweepstakes, to request catalog samples from the merchants appearing on PlazaDirect, and to obtain interesting and useful information about products and services. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we receive about you when you submit your entry form. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully because it governs how we use the information you submit to us. If the Privacy Policy changes in the future, we will not use the information you have submitted to us in a manner that is inconsistent with the Privacy Policy under which the information was originally collected.

**Information - What You Provide to Us and How We Use It**  
When you enter our sweepstakes or register with PlazaDirect.com for any other purpose, you will be providing personal information to us.

We will also provide your name and address to trusted third parties in order that they may send catalogs or other marketing materials to you.

If you opt-in (specifically choose) to receive e-mail offers about new products and services available from our trusted third party marketing partners, we will combine the personal information that you have given to us with other personal information about you that is available to us from our records and other sources (such as demographic information and past purchase history), in order provide you with email notices and offers that will be geared towards your individual preferences and tastes. Each email that you receive will provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future e-mails.
