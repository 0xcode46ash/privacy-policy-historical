NETRonline has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and the protection of your personal information.  
  
   
  
Privacy Policy  
  
| _**  
Advertisers**_   
We use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. _**Cookies**_  
This site uses cookies. Its use is restricted to simplifying the login process of certain sections of our Web site. _**Order Forms**_  
Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the order forms is used to respond to the visitor when necessary, or to provide them with the information they have requested. In no way is this information ever shared or distributed to outside parties. _**Disclaimers**_  
NETR and NETRonline encourage all users to browse the internet responsibly, and to heed these and all subsequent disclaimers that may appear while navigating from this site _ **Links**_  
This site contains links to other sites. NETRonline is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. You may establish a hypertext link to this Web site so long as the link does not state or imply any sponsorship of your site by NETRonline. However, you may not, without the prior written permission of NETRonline, frame any of the content of the Service, or incorporate into another website or other service any intellectual property of NETRonline. _**Accounts and Secure Transactions**_  
A portion of NETRonline allows a visitor to acquire online products or services by secure credit card transaction. When an purchase is made, NETRonline will be acquiring your name, address, email, and password. Basic order information is stored in our database: who, what, when, how much. Credit Card transactions are conducted using the authorizing service E Processing Network. NETR and the domain netronline.com possess a secure certificate from VeriSign that is used during credit card transactions.

Two types of credit card transactions will be conducted through NETRonline: 

**1) Pay as you go** :   
Each purchase is made by a separate credit card transaction.   
**2) Account** :   
One initial purchase is made by either submitting funds to NETRonline by postal mail, or by a secure online credit card transaction. A running balance will be maintained by NETRonline , from which future purchases will be deducted. Balance information on a customer's account will be securely stored in our database with the other account information. 

When a user wishes to terminate an account, all funds in that account will be returned in 7-10 business days by the method which they were submitted (either credited to the credit card or returned by postal mail). To notify NETRonline of your desire to terminate your account, you may contact NETR Account Services.
