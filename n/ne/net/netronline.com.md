** Accounts and Secure Transactions **

> A portion of **NETR _online_** allows a visitor to acquire online products or services by secure credit card transaction.  When an purchase is made, **NETR _online_** will be acquiring your name, address, email, and password.  Basic order information is stored in our database: who, what, when, how much.  This information will be stored on MS SQL Server, which is password protected and cannot be remotely interfaced with.  No credit card information is stored in our database.
> 
> Credit Card transactions will be conducted using an authorizing service,
>
>> [**The E Processing Network**](http://www.eprocessingnetwork.com/) ,
> 
> to handle the transactions securely.  Once a user makes a purchase, they will be sent to the Authorizer's web site for the secure transaction.  **NETR _online_** will provide to them the information the customer provided to us (name, address), product purchase list, and prices.  The Authorizer will take the credit card number and expiration date from the customer.  Once complete, the Authorizer will return the customer to **NETR _online_** with a success or failure code.  If successful, the purchase will be complete.  
> 
> **NETR _online_ ** will never be in possession of a credit card number or expiration date.  
> 
> Two types of credit card transactions will be conducted through **NETR _online_** :
>
>> Pay as you go:  Each purchase is made by a separate credit card transaction.
>> 
>> Account:  One initial purchase is made by either submitting funds to **NETR _online_** by postal mail, or by a secure online credit card transaction.  A running balance will be maintained by **NETR _online_** , from which future purchases will be deducted.  Balance information on a customer's account will be securely stored in MS SQL Server with the other account information.
>>
>>> When a user wishes to terminate an account, all funds in that account will be returned in 7-10 business days by the method which they were submitted (either credited to the credit card or returned by postal mail).  To notify **NETR _online_** of your desire to terminate your account, you may contact [**NETR Account Services**](mailto:greg@netronline.com?subject=Terminate%20Account).
>>> 
>>> Accounts are password protected.  In the event that a password is forgotten, it is the policy of **NETR _online_** that it will be mailed to the postal address which is listed in your account information.  Click [**here**](http://www.netronline.com/password.htm) to notify **NETR _online_** of a lost password.  
>>> 
>>> If your address is different now than it was when you established your account, you must submit to NETR an affidavit signed by you in the presence of a notary public.  This affidavit must clearly state your current and previous address.  Mail this to:
