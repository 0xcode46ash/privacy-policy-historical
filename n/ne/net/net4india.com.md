# Net4India ::: Internet Service that means business

  
Net 4 India knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your expectation that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting our Web site or by otherwise interacting with Net 4 India, you agree to accept the practices described in this Privacy Notice. The Privacy Policy applies only to Net 4 India and those websites that carry the Net 4 India brand. It does not apply to any other organizationâ€™s websites that we provide links to. 

What Information Does Net 4 India Collect?

> Here are the types of information we gather from visitors to Net 4 India: 
> 
> Information You Give Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provided to us in any other way, such as by telephone or by electronic mail. For example, we are required by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ("ICANN"), the organization which assumes responsibility for domain name allocation, to collect information about you during the domain name registration process. This information includes your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number. We also collect certain financial information from you during the domain name registration process. Namely, when you apply to register a domain name through Net 4 India and the payment option selected by you is via Credit card, we require you to provide a credit card number and billing address before we will process that application. 
> 
> Automatic Information: Net 4 India does not use "cookies." We do, however, receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, our servers track the type of Web browser you are using, and the page to which you link from Net 4 India. We collect this information to better develop a sense of what services our customers need and not to track your individual usage patterns. 

  
Does Net 4 India Share the Information It Receives? 

ICANN requires Net 4 India to make your full name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and, where provided, your facsimile number, as well as the creation and expiration dates of your domain name registration and the nameserver information associated with your domain name, to the public via an interactive Web page and a "port 43" WHOIS service. For the purposes of this Privacy Notice we will refer to this information as your "WHOIS Information." Please note that we may not be able to control how members of the public may use the WHOIS Information. If you have opted-into having your WHOIS Information available for bulk access, ICANN also requires Net 4 India to make that information available to third parties who enter into a bulk WHOIS data access agreement with Net 4 India. In making your selection to opt-into having your WHOIS Information available for bulk access, please refer to Bulk WHOIS data policy information.

Please note that if you have not opted-into having your WHOIS Information available for bulk access for marketing or other purposes, your WHOIS Information will still be made available to the public through the "port 43" WHOIS service described above. 

Except as set out in this Privacy Notice, you will receive notice when personal information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to have us share that information. We share personal information as described below: 

> Agents: We engage other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include providing marketing assistance, providing customer services, sending postal mail and email to you, removing repetitive information from customer lists, and analyzing data. These persons have access to personal information needed to perform their functions.
> 
> Service Providers: We engage other companies and individuals to perform enhanced services on our behalf. Many of our service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their services. 
> 
> Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or their assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if Net 4 India Limited or all or substantially all of its assets were ever to be acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 
> 
> Protection of Net 4 India and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is: (i) appropriate to comply with the law of the land; (ii) necessary for compliance with any legal summons, notices, orders, enquiries by law enforcement officials/ quasi-judicial forces; (iii) enforce or apply our Services Agreement and other agreements; (iv) or protect the rights, property, or safety of Net 4 India, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. 

  
Electronic Mail 

From time to time, Net 4 India may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning your use of our services. These communications are intended to inform you of important information regarding your account, or about general services provided by Net 4 India. If you do not want to receive email from us regarding service updates, please click the "unsubscribe link" at the bottom of any email you receive from Net 4 India. We will, however, continue to send you email regarding your account administration and necessary information, such as renewal information. 

How Secure Is Information About Me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which encrypts information you input. We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. You can further help to ensure your security by taking a few simple precautions. For instance, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your Net 4 India username and password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. 

What Information Can I Access? 

Net 4 India gives you access to certain information about you for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. 

  
Sites Other Than Net 4 India 

Although Net 4 India is committed to protecting your privacy, not all other Web sites are as conscientious. Therefore, Net 4 India cannot be responsible for the content or privacy policies of other Web sites including those of advertisers to which it may link and those which link to Net 4 India. This Privacy Notice applies only to the information collected by this Web site. We ask that you review the privacy policies of every online service you use before submitting personal information.
