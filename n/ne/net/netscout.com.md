**Non-Personal/Anonymous Information Collection**  
In some instances NetScout may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the website. Please read the “Cookies” section below for more information.

**Sharing Your Personal Information  
** We will not sell rent or otherwise provide your Personal Information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have granted us permission to do so.

We may be required to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure or other legal process requirements. NetScout will use reasonable efforts to limit the Personal Information it provides for these purposes.

We may share your Personal Information within NetScout or any of our worldwide locations for purposes of data processing or storage. 

We may also share your Personal Information with business partners, service vendors, authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction, including processing orders, processing credit card transactions, hosting websites, hosting event and seminar registration and providing customer support. We will only provide these third parties with the minimum amount of Personal Information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction and we require that they treat Personal Information consistent with the terms contained in this policy. 

We may collect and share Personal Information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of NetScout’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

The NetScout.com web site may provide links to non-NetScout sites we believe may be of interest to you. Those sites are beyond our control. You are advised to check the privacy policies and terms of use of any non-NetScout sites before providing your personal information to them. 

We will ask for your consent before we use or share your Personal Information for any purpose other than the reason you provided it or as otherwise provided by this policy. In order to let us know your preferences, we will require an action on your part, such as checking the appropriate option, to indicate your consent.

**Security of Your Personal Information  
** The security of your Personal Information is very important to NetScout.  We have in place physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access.  In addition, NetScout uses standard security protocols and mechanisms to exchange the transmission of sensitive data such as credit card details.

While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit. We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your Personal Information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and use a secure browser. 

**Cookies**  
NetScout may use “cookies” or similar technologies to collect certain information about you (such as IP addresses and domain names) to recognize and recall certain information about you when you visit our site, and to enable us to know when you have visited our site. We do this to enhance your use and the performance of the NetScout site.  If you do not want to enable the use of cookies, most web browsers have an option that allows you to reject or refuse cookies.  If you elect to refuse cookies, it may affect or limit your use of the NetScout site.  
As is true when you visit most web sites, NetScout may automatically receive information from you as part of the communication connection itself, which often consists of network routing information (where you came from), equipment information (browser type), and date and time.  NetScout may also use embedded URLs and embedded pixels to capture additional information.

**Data Retention**  
NetScout will not retain your Personal Information no longer than is necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected or as required by applicable laws or regulations. 

**Discussion Groups and Forums  
** If you participate in a NetScout discussion group or forum, you should be aware that the information you provide there is broadly available to all others who have access to that discussion forum or chat room, including parties both inside and outside NetScout. Also, please recognize that individual forums and chat rooms may have additional rules and conditions. Each participant’s opinion on a forum or chat room is his or her own and should not be considered as reflecting the opinion of NetScout.

**Non-US Use**  
If you reside or are located outside of the United States of America, be aware that any Personal Information you provide to NetScout will be transferred to the United States.  Certain countries may not allow information (such as email) to be transmitted outside of that country or region.   
By clicking on buttons such as “submit,” “continue,” “register,” etc., you consent to the transfers and processing referred to above taking place. If you have any concerns, we suggest you do not use the forms or contact mechanisms included in this web site, and use an alternative form of contacting us such as telephoning one of our operators or writing to us by postal mail. 

**Policy Updates**  
NetScout may amend this privacy statement from time to time. We will post a prominent notice in this section of this policy notifying users when it is updated.
