|  **Privacy Policy** |   
---|---  
  
Online privacy concerns focus on the protection of "member identifiable" information which a member reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "member identifiable" information is information which can be associated with a specific individual or entity, including, for example, a member's name, address, or telephone number, e-mail address and information about online activities that are directly linked to them.   
  
It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations to collect member identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services.   
  
netCOMPONENTS endeavors to safeguard the member identifiable information obtained from its web site users and visitors (collectively, "members") from unauthorized intrusions.   
  
**_General_**   
  
netCOMPONENTS will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any member identifiable information derived from the registration for, or use of, a netCOMPONENTS online service - including member names and addresses - without the consent of the member except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the event that such member is engaging in unlawful use of our web site. Member identifiable information will, however, be disclosed by you when you utilize our system to contact a supplier, such as when e-mailing a supplier or requesting pricing information or completing purchase orders. When netCOMPONENTS uses third parties to perform services on its behalf, netCOMPONENTS will request that such third parties protect your member identifiable information consistently with this privacy policy. However, we cannot ensure that all of your member identifiable information will never be disclosed, as regulatory and/or other requirements may make disclosure necessary.   
  
**Collection and Use:** netCOMPONENTS servers automatically gather information about traffic activity within the netCOMPONENTS web site, including which pages are viewed and which functions are executed. netCOMPONENTS primarily uses this information only in the aggregate. netCOMPONENTS may collect and use member identifiable information for various purposes, including but not limited to, billing purposes, to provide or change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that netCOMPONENTS may use your member identifiable information, in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services that may be of interest to you, but netCOMPONENTS will not disclose your member identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you.   
  
**Member Opt-Out:** A member may choose not to receive direct marketing communications from netCOMPONENTS in connection with netCOMPONENTS online services. Upon such choice, netCOMPONENTS (a) will not contact that member directly with marketing messages about netCOMPONENTS online services, and (b) will not use member identifiable information obtained from that member's registration to contact that member with marketing messages about any netCOMPONENTS products or services. A member may choose not to receive such messages by notifying netCOMPONENTS via e-mail, fax or mail.   
  
**Security:** netCOMPONENTS has implemented technology and security features to safeguard the privacy of your member identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use, and netCOMPONENTS, based on its judgment, will continue to enhance its security procedures as new technology becomes available. However, "perfect security" is not available on the Internet.   
  
**E-mail Contents:** netCOMPONENTS will not read or disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are transmitted using netCOMPONENTS services except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law.   
  
**Logging:** netCOMPONENTS provides logging features for e-mail and other communications used in the procurement process that are transmitted using netCOMPONENTS services. A member may choose to turn their own logging on or off. netCOMPONENTS will not read or disclose to third parties members private information that is logged except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law.   
  
**Improper Conduct:** netCOMPONENTS may also use member identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the member agreement for that service.   
  
**Account Information:** netCOMPONENTS honors requests from members for account information and will correct any such information which may be inaccurate. Members may verify that appropriate corrections have been made.   
  
**_Supplier Inventory File Uploads_**   
  
netCOMPONENTS is sensitive to the privacy, control, use, and security issues surrounding uploaded supplier/seller inventory files. netCOMPONENTS system is designed to prevent inventory files and aggregate inventory information from falling into unauthorized hands. Members have searching/viewing privileges only (they cannot download) and cannot do a sort to bring up aggregate data of a particular supplier. However, "perfect security" is not available on the Internet.   
  
netCOMPONENTS also provides content at locations other than the netCOMPONENTS web site that give the supplier, if eligible for inclusion, expanded exposure to electronic component buyers and engineers. netCOMPONENTS also takes measures, in these cases, to control the data or otherwise prevent the supplier's aggregate inventory information from falling into unauthorized hands, including providing only limited or partial data that is searchable by part number only. Suppliers not desiring to have their inventory data displayed at locations other than the netCOMPONENTS web site may opt-out by notifying netCOMPONENTS in writing via facsimile or e-mail.   
  
netCOMPONENTS would be pleased to provide, upon request (webmaster@netcomponents.com) by a supplier, a Nondisclosure Agreement (NDA) in order to provide further assurances regarding the protection of, and use of, the supplier's inventory data by netCOMPONENTS.   
  
**_Cookies_**   
  
The netCOMPONENTS web site makes limited use of "cookies" for the purposes of 1) making the member experience more efficient and secure, and 2) facilitating the gathering of non-specific member information. A cookie is a commonly used internet standard which stores, in a very small text file on the member's hard disk, information specific to the member. Cookie technology prevents access of this information by any web site other than the web site issuing the cookie. The private features of the netCOMPONENTS web site are only accessible when cookies are enabled in the member's browser. If a member does not wish to utilize cookie technology, this feature may be disabled within the member's web browser. However, doing so makes the private features of the netCOMPONENTS web site unavailable through that browser (for as long as cookies are disabled).   
  
**_Other Web Sites_**   
  
netCOMPONENTS' privacy policy only applies to the netCOMPONENTS web site. The netCOMPONENTS web site may link from several points throughout it's web site to third party information and service providers who may collect personal information from members in order to provide members with information or services. netCOMPONENTS has no control over the privacy policy of any third party company. Please examine the privacy policies of such third parties prior to submitting any personal information, as they may differ from netCOMPONENTS.   
  
netCOMPONENTS web site content is also featured on other web sites with differing or non-existent privacy policies. These web sites may collect personal information from their members that may or may not be used in conjunction with netCOMPONENTS site information. Prior to supplying any personal information to any third party company linking to netCOMPONENTS site, please read and understand their privacy policy.   
  
**_Advertisements_**   
  
Advertisements may appear on pages throughout the netCOMPONENTS web site. Some advertisements may request information directly from members or take members to web sites that may request personal information. netCOMPONENTS has no control over its advertisers' privacy policies, so please examine the privacy policy of any company advertising on netCOMPONENTS site prior to submitting any personal information.   
  
**_Surveys_**   
  
Occasionally, netCOMPONENTS may conduct surveys on it's web site. Surveys are conducted at random and are completely voluntary to web site members. The survey may require a member to provide member identifiable information in exchange for the information or services provided by the survey. netCOMPONENTS may use this information in an aggregate manner to better tailor the type of services, information, and advertising that are provided on it's web site.   
  
**_Policy Changes_**   
  
netCOMPONENTS reserves the right to change its privacy policy by publishing new terms on its web site and your access and use of the netCOMPONENTS web site thereafter constitutes your acknowledgment and acceptance of same. This privacy policy does not create any legal right for you or any third parties.
