**1\. Privacy Statement**

Net Starter is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. We have structured our Web site so that, in general, you can visit Net Starter on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. 

Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your contact/client relationship with Net Starter. 

**2\. Awareness**

Net Starter provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy, practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every Netstarter.com.au page, including pages found within our client system and subdomains. 

**3\. What we collect**

On some Net Starter web sites, you can subscribe to different events and seminars, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are name, contact and some preference information. 

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services (including registration), we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your professional interests, demographics and more detailed contact preferences. 

Our electronic newsletters record anonymous data about articles you have expressed interest in. Some Netstarter.com.au web pages use cookies, a data analysis technique. 

**4\. How we use it**

Net Starter uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service, whether as a visitor of the firm, contact or client. 

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. 

**5\. Who we share it with**

Net Starter will not sell, rent, or lease your personally identifiable information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we will only share the personal data you provide online with other Net Starter entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described in "how we use it". Such Net Starter entities and/or business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

**6\. Choice**

Net Starter will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honour such requests. 

Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. 

**7\. Accuracy & Access**

Net Starter strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. 

We will provide you with access to your information, including making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may view, update or correct your information. 

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. To access your personally identifiable information, return to the web page where you originally entered it and follow the instructions on that web page. To opt-out of Net Starter contact, provide your name, email and/or address and relevant information about subscriptions or registrations you may have with Net Starter. 

This opt-out will cancel all marketing and support communication and newsletters, including offline subscriptions. Certain areas of Net Starter's Web sites may limit access to specific individuals through the use of passwords and through providing personally data. 

Links to third party web sites on the site are provided solely as a convenience to you. If you use these links, you will leave the Net Starter site. Net Starter has not reviewed all of these third party sites and does not control and is not responsible for any of these sites, their content or their privacy policy. 

Thus, Net Starter does not endorse or make any representations about them, or any information, software or other products or materials found there, or any results that may be obtained from using them. If you decide to access any of the third party sites linked to this site, you do so at your own risk. 

**8\. Security**

Net Starter is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use encryption when collecting or transferring sensitive data.
