# NetIQ - Privacy Policy

  


In order to provide you with the best possible service, it helps us to know something about who you are and what your goals are in visiting our web site. By necessity, that means we must occasionally ask you for information about yourself. Your privacy is important to us, and our highest priority is to ensure that the information you provide is used responsibly and kept secure.

By using the pages on this web site that request personal information, you agree to the collection and the use of the information by NetIQ. If we decide to revise or update our privacy policy, this page will always reflect our latest policy.

This web site includes various registration forms that require you to provide personal information. Forms may also include non-mandatory information. NetIQ may send you emails with news about NetIQ products and special promotions. You can opt not to receive such emails by sending a request to [unsubscribe@netiq.com](mailto:unsubscribe@netiq.com). If you wish to unsubscribe from NetIQ's monthly newsletter, NetResults, please submit your request to [remove.newsletter@netiq.com](mailto:remove.newsletter@netiq.com).

NetIQ may, from time to time, run promotions and contests on this web site. Such promotions and contests require you to provide personal information, such as name, email address, and company. By entering your personal information, you indicate your eligibility to enter and you authorize NetIQ to use your name if you are a winner. Winners may be contacted by phone or email.

Some information may also be used to facilitate software downloads for customers who request product trials or product updates, and to grant access to secure, value-added areas of this web site to customers who have a support contract.

Information gathered from the web site is stored securely in a database. In addition to using this information to provide customers with the information, materials, and services that they have requested, NetIQ also uses this information for internal business purposes, such as evaluating customer interest in particular products and developing new products and services. NetIQ does not sell contact information to other companies.

NetIQ occasionally uses cookies to store information that will make it easier for you to use this site. Cookies store this information in encrypted format; cookies are not used to store sensitive information.

We use WebTrends Live to analyze traffic to this web site. Unlike some tracking services, WebTrends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors or maintain a database of individual profiles for each visitor. WebTrends Live collects only aggregate data. For more information about WebTrends Live's privacy policy, please [click here](http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm).

This web site links to other sites for which NetIQ is not responsible. As such, we cannot provide details on any privacy policies that may be implemented by those sites.

NetIQ welcomes any questions that you may have about our privacy policy. Please contact us at [webmaster@netiq.com](mailto:webmaster@netiq.com).
