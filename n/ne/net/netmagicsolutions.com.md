#### I. What information does Netmagic collect and how is it used?

There are a variety of situations in which Netmagic may collect personal information, such as when you register as a customer; purchase one of our products/ services; download case studies or white papers; order email newsletters; respond to a marketing campaign; place orders on our website; or when you’re working with a Netmagic service representative. In each of those situations, Netmagic only collects the personal information required to meet your needs. Depending on the circumstances, we may ask for your name, company name, Internet domain name, industry, IP address, billing or shipping address, credit card information, email address, fax number, phone number, or other pertinent information. Netmagic uses your information to better understand your needs, provide you with the services you have requested, and with a view to provide you with better service. We may use your information to help you complete a transaction, (including fulfillment of orders and promotional offers), to communicate back to you, to inform you of service updates as well as to manage and renew your subscription(s). 

Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing, maintenance of your subscription, and fraud protection and are not used for other purposes without your permission. Netmagic will keep your personal information for as long as you are a registered subscriber or user of our service(s) and thereafter, for no longer than is reasonably necessary for internal reporting and reconciliation purposes and to provide you with any feedback or information that you might request or require.

With the consent of our customers, Netmagic posts customer testimonials on our website, which may contain personally identifiable information, such as the customer’s name. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by email or via a prominent notice on our website and where necessary we will seek the prior consent of our users.

If at any time you wish to remove your personal information from a Netmagic website testimonial, please [contact service support](mailto:marketing@netmagicsolutions.com).

#### II. Does Netmagic disclose personal information?

In limited circumstances, Netmagic may need to share your information in order to meet your particular needs. Netmagic has a number of relationships with vendors with whom we may share your personal information for the purpose of providing a service, fulfilling an order, or meeting your other needs, including the provision of customer support. For example, we use selected vendors for the purpose of providing credit card transaction and check processing services. These vendors verify your purchase information, such as credit card number or checking account number, and authorize your transaction. In doing so, the vendors have access to limited information about users, but they are prohibited from using the information for any other purpose. Netmagic imposes strict confidentiality obligations on all third-party vendors with whom we share your information. By providing your information to us, you are deemed to consent to the transfer of your information to Netmagic’s third-party vendors in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

We may also need to share your personal information with other legal entities within Netmagic. All such entities adhere to the Netmagic Privacy Policy. From time to time, Netmagic may provide personal information to law enforcement authorities or other third parties in response to a subpoena, an official inquiry, or as may be required in the case of national security. Netmagic will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.

E-Billing Solutions (EBS) is a third-party vendor providing e-commerce solutions for Netmagic’s online payment gateway. As a result, Netmagic shares certain personal information with EBS to complete your transactions. The protection of such information is addressed in EBS’s [Privacy Statement](http://www.ebs.in/privacy-statement.php). Netmagic disclaims all liability for the data processing activities of its outside vendors.

#### VII. Does Netmagic keep track of website visitor data? 

Like many other companies, Netmagic uses “cookies” to remember user preferences and maximize performance of our website and services.

Any personal information we collect with cookies is not shared with any outside parties.

Please note the information gathered by cookies is necessary to provide certain subscription services. We cannot provide those services to users who do not give their consent to the data processing carried out through cookies or whose browsers are set to reject all cookies.

Cookies may also be used to control the type and/or frequency of ads, promotions, or other marketing messages the customer views. These ads may be placed by third-party advertising companies. Any information the advertising companies collect is non-personal and anonymous.

As is common on the Internet, Netmagic maintains log files of the traffic that visits our sites. For example, our servers may automatically record the information you or your browser send when you visit a website. These log files may include information such as your requests, IP address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your system.
