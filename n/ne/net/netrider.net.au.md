Netrider Privacy Statement

  
Netrider is committed to protecting your personal information. Where your personal information may be disclosed, and to the extent that we can, we believe in giving you a choice as to whom we may disclose your personal information, who may use your personal information and how that personal information may be used.

We believe that our Privacy Policy complies with the requirements of the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

**How we collect, use and disclose your personal information**

Generally, Netrider will collect personal information directly from you only to the extent necessary to provide membership service. The type of personal information we may collect from you generally comprises name, address, age group, gender, contact details and information collected as a result of you using or acquiring products or services through Netrider.

Occasionally, we may also collect, use or disclose your personal information for the secondary purpose of facilitating the distribution of marketing materials to you by Netrider or a third party (For example, Daily email summary from website of member posts). We will not do this if you opt for us not to do so.

We have a duty to keep confidential all personal information we hold about you. Generally, our duty of confidentiality applies except where disclosure of your personal information is:

* Compelled by law
  
For example, disclosure to various government departments and agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office, and disclosure to courts under subpoena.
* In the public interest
  
For example, where a crime, fraud or misdemeanour is committed or suspected, and disclosure against the customer's rights to confidentiality is justified.
* With your consent
  
Your consent is important to us. Your consent may be implied or expressed and it may also be verbal or written.

You imply consent where we may reasonably conclude that you have given consent by the actions you take or do not take. For example, where you acquire or use an overseas product, service or agency function (eg. Yahoo!Groups), you consent to that third party storing, using, maintaining and disclosing your personal information to the extent necessary for us to provide that particular Netrider product or service to you.

If you do not consent to certain uses of your personal information we may not be able to provide that particular Netrider product or service to you.

We reserve the right to make changes to the Netrider Privacy Policy and this Privacy Statement from time to time or as required by law.

**Security of your personal information**

Netrider takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from loss, misuse, unauthorised disclosure or destruction. Netrider has in place generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to keep your personal information safe.

**Web site security and privacy**

The internet has dramatically changed the way we do business. It allows Netrider to provide members products and services to them from the convenience of their own home or office.

We understand that you may be concerned about the confidentiality and security of the personal information we collect from you online. Accordingly, we have systems in place to ensure our online dealings with you are as secure and confidential as your dealings with us in person, or on the telephone.

**Cookies**

A "cookie" is a packet of information that allows the Netrider server (the computer that houses our web site) to identify and interact more effectively with your computer.

When you access our web site, we may send you a "temporary cookie" that gives you a unique identification number. A different identification number is sent each time you use our web site. Cookies do not identify individual users, although they do identify a user's internet browser type and your Internet Service Provider.

You can configure your internet browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent. Please note - with some Netrider services such as the picture gallery, "cookies" must be enabled on your internet browser in order to use and access the features of this product.

Shortly after you end your interaction with our web site, the cookie expires or "crumbles". This means it no longer exists on your computer and therefore cannot be used for further identification or access to your computer.

Some Netrider services, such as the discussion forums and picture gallery, enable you to select that your login details are remembered for next time you visit. If you select this option, the cookie will remain on your system.

**Links to other sites**

The Netrider site contains links to other sites. In addition, some of the content appearing on the Netrider web site may be supplied by third parties, for example, by framing third party web sites or the incorporation through "framesets" of content supplied by third party servers.

While Netrider will always endeavour to engage in business arrangements with commercial entities of good repute and ethical business practices, we are ultimately not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. We encourage you to read and understand the privacy policies on those web sites prior to providing any information to them.
