## How we store your personal information

The information that we collect from you may be transferred to and stored at a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. By submitting your personal information you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your personal information is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

These countries may not have the same data protection laws as those within the EEA, however, where such transfers do occur we will take the necessary steps to safeguard the security and integrity of your information and ensure it is processed to a standard commensurate with the requirements within these jurisdictions.

All information you provide to us via our site is stored on our secure servers. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Unfortunately the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your personal information we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

Access to systems that hold recruitment related information is restricted to authorised personnel through the use of unique identifiers and passwords. Your information is stored on systems that are protected by secure network architectures and are backed-up on a regular basis for disaster recovery and business continuity purposes and to avoid the risk of inadvertent erasure or destruction.

Our third party service providers will process your information in accordance with **our**  instructions and make decisions regarding the information as part of the delivery of their services. They are also required to put in place appropriate security measures that ensure an adequate level of protection for personal information.

**We may disclose your personal information to third parties in the following circumstances:**

  * In the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal information to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets.

This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection.
  * We may, in certain circumstances, disclose applicant personal information to the police (and other law enforcement agencies), if they are necessary for the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Each police disclosure request will be dealt with on a strict case by case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and proportionate.
  * We may also disclose applicant information to other third parties in order to defend our legal rights or in an emergency where the health or personal security of an applicant is at risk.



We may also use your personal information, or permit selected third parties to use your personal information, to provide you with details about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone, email or other electronic means.
