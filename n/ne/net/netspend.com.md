All visitors and current NetSpend cardholders to www.netspend.com are subject to the NetSpend Online Privacy Policy: 

At NetSpend, we recognize that the trust of our customers is one of our most important assets. As such, our primary goal is to deliver innovative payment products and world-class service while ensuring the integrity and sanctity of our customers' privacy. The following outlines some of the steps that we take on a daily basis to ensure that our customers' information is secure, private, and used only in a manner consistent with our customers' wishes. We will safeguard, according to our strict standards of security and confidentiality, any and all information our customers share with us. We use advanced security techniques and processes designed to protect the integrity and privacy of our customers' information, particularly when this information is used by our employees and partners to provide customer service.

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: (i) Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, (ii) Information about your transactions with us, or others such as your Card account balance, transaction history, parties to transactions and card usage, and (iii) Information we received from third parties, including government agencies, consumer-reporting agencies, such as your tax identification number and creditworthiness and credit history. We advise our customers about the general uses of the information we collect about them, and we will gladly and promptly provide additional explanation if our customers request it. We may disclose aggregate information about our customers and former customers to third parties with whom we may have a joint marketing agreement, or those companies who perform marketing services on our behalf. This includes all information we may collect directly or indirectly from you. NetSpend also uses your information to market its services to you and to gain feedback on potential new services. We will permit only authorized employees, who are properly trained in the appropriate handling of sensitive customer information, to have access to that information, and only if required by their business responsibilities. Employees who violate our Privacy Policy are subject to our disciplinary process, up to and including termination. 

We give our customers choices as to how their information is used, if at all. We provide our customers with the opportunity to remove their names used for mail, telephone or online marketing upon initial customer contact and subsequently on an annual basis. This opt-out choice includes products and services offered by NetSpend Corporation and our affiliate marketing partners, and customers may easily opt out by contacting us via U.S. mail or telephone.

Except as outlined above, we limit the release of customer information. In addition to providing our customers with the opportunity to opt out of marketing offers, we release information only with a customer's consent or request, or when we are required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. When a court order or subpoena requires us to release customer information, we notify the customer promptly in order to provide the customer with the opportunity to exercise their legal rights. The only exception to this policy is when we are prohibited from notifying the customer by law or due to a court order, or in cases in which fraud, money laundering and/or criminal or illegal activity is suspected.

We quickly respond to our customers' requests for explanation. In the event that we deny service or choose to end a particular customer's relationship, and to the extent permitted by applicable laws, we will provide a prompt and detailed explanation if requested. We will notify our customers in the event that our privacy policy changes. If our privacy policy is modified, we will attempt to notify our customers of these changes via e-mail, U.S. mail or via telephone. As customers do now, they will continue to have a choice as to whether or not they allow us to use their information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site (www.netspend.com) notifying users of said change(s). In some cases when we post the notice, we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. We will post our annual privacy policy notice to the cardholder's account center on our website. When we post our annual privacy policy notice we will also e-mail cardholders notifying them of the annual privacy notice. Should you wish, a paper annual privacy policy notice will be made available to you upon request.

Should customers need to update any information they have previously supplied to us, they may contact NetSpend Customer Service at 1-86-NETSPEND (1-866-387-7363) from 8:00AM to 10:00PM CT, Monday through Friday, and 8:00AM to 8:00PM CT, Saturday and Sunday.
