# Privacy Policy

**EMM Privacy Policy**

We respect and are committed to protecting your privacy.  This privacy policy lets you know how your personal information is collected and used, both by EMM and our clients who use our hosted application.  We have created this privacy policy so that you can understand the care with which we intend to treat your personal information.

**Information Collection and Use**

In cooperation with our clients, EMM collects lists of data including personal information with the purpose of delivering permission-based email campaigns to those lists.  EMM hosts these client lists on our servers. 

Our hosted application works in concert with this privacy policy to ensure that no sharing or disclosure of list data including personal information can occur between clients or to third parties.  EMM is contractually bound with each of our clients to maintain the privacy and integrity of their campaign data to include all personal information, tracking data and analytical data.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

EMM will never use, sell, share, disclose or rent any internal or customer supplied data to any clients, prospects, or other third parties. 

**Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies**

Some of our Web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies such as a single pixel gif.  EMM use single-pixel gif images, to count web page accesses and gather some general statistical information such as if an email has been opened or read.  Collected information is tied to the users personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties 

**Confidentiality and Security**

EMM warrants that all customer data remains the property of our customers.  We also will not use, rent, sell, transfer, or otherwise expose the contents of the tracking information resulting from click through, message opened, message read, or E Commerce conversions. EMM provides an SSL encrypted, password-protected mechanism for viewing and extracting customer data.  EMM maintains all customer data in a carrier-class secure facility protected by firewalls and other security devices. 

**Unsolicited Commercial Email (SPAM)**

EMM is committed to providing a permission-based model for email marketing.  To that end we can a strict anti-spam policy for all of our clients.  EMM clients are explicitly prohibited from sending any unsolicited material to recipients who have not expressed their permission to receive communications from our clients.  Additionally, EMM services may only be used for lawful purposes and may not violate any local, state, federal or international laws. 

These policies are part of our broader reaching Acceptable Use Policy that each of our clients are contractually bound to.  Violation of this policy will lead to a speedy termination of all access to the EMM application, servers and network.
