## How do you protect my privacy?

We understand that you may be concerned about privacy issues that surround the use of the Internet. And, we believe that you should have control over who receives your personal information, whether it concerns where you live, what your interests are, or how you choose to conduct transactions. We do not use the personal information that you provide, except to complete the transaction. In fact, we only disclose personal information to the charities if you give us your permission. You may also choose to make your donation anonymously. We will never sell, trade, or rent your personal information to other individuals or companies. 

## Will the charity I contribute to protect my privacy?

Each charity has its own policies regarding privacy of donor information. Please contact the charity you contribute to directly to learn about their privacy policies. We will only pass on the information you provide us if you authorize us to do so.
