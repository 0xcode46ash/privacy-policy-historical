**NetShelter Inc. Privacy Statement**   
Consumer privacy is of paramount importance to NetShelter Inc. ("NetShelter"), our advertisers, and the Web publishers in our network. NetShelter is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers, publishers, and advertisers, and to do our part to maintain the integrity of the Internet. 

The following statement outlines NetShelter's policies and principles regarding online privacy.

**Internet Consumer Data Collected by NetShelter**

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**  
When a consumer responds to an Internet advertisement served by NetShelter (running through our network of websites or in an email advertisement), NetShelter may collect personally identifiable information (e.g. name, address, zip code, e-mail address, gender, birth date) regarding the consumer who responded to the ad and who completed a form in order to receive various information, offers, etc. In all cases where such information is collected, it is done so only if the consumer voluntarily, knowingly and explicitly provided such information.   
By providing this information and their permission to receive communications from our marketing partners, consumers are agreeing to allow NetShelter to make their personally identifiable information available to the company sponsoring the advertisement, as well as to other trusted third parties in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy. As a result, these consumers may receive information on additional products, services and offers that may be of interest to them. NetShelter and/or our marketing partners may enhance and/or merge personally identifiable information about consumers, who have specifically requested to receive marketing communications, with commercially-available third party data collected from other sources in an effort to ensure that the messages being sent to the consumer in online and/or offline marketing programs are relevant to their interests. In the event we enhance and/or merge such personally identifiable information with data collected from other sources, we will take reasonable steps to maintain the integrity and quality of that information.   
NetShelter may share personally identifiable information (including information that has been enhanced with information from other sources) with advertisers, third party marketers and our affiliates for their online and/or offline marketing programs. While NetShelter strongly encourages clients and partners to adopt responsible approaches to online marketing, NetShelter is not responsible for the information practices of clients or their partners. The collection, use, and disclosure of information by clients and partners are subject to their respective privacy policies, which may differ from NetShelter's policy. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)**  
When a consumer responds to an Internet advertisement served by NetShelter (running through our network of websites or in an email transmission), NetShelter collects certain technical data (Type of Browser, Operating System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement, etc.). This type of information is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network Advertising Initiative section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) "ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes.   
NetShelter retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for accounting and auditing purposes.

**Consumer Choices Concerning Data Collection**

**Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies**  
When a consumer views an ad served by NetShelter, they are assigned a unique - but not personally-identifiable - number, known as a cookie, which is recorded and stored on their computer in their web browser's cookie file. Cookies do not harm Internet consumer's computers. While cookies are not essential to NetShelter's continued success, they do help us to reach several of our key goals, such as providing Internet users with a more fulfilling, results oriented experience on the web, reducing the repetition of advertising, and increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by Internet consumers. 

**Remove and Disable Option**  
You have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in your browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this.   
**Security Precautions**

NetShelter makes every effort to maintain the security of its network and the data we collect. Any data that is stored on NetShelter's server is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. NetShelter has a strict internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, limiting access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering NetShelter products and services. 

**The NetShelter Network**

**NetShelter and Client Website Privacy Policy Statements**  
NetShelter requests that website publishers belonging to our advertising network consent to and comply with the standards of online privacy, as outlined by the Online Privacy Alliance (OPA).   
Also, in accordance with the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI), NetShelter strongly encourages all websites within our network to create privacy policy statements and to provide Internet consumers with conspicuous access to their statements. Additionally, NetShelter requests that all website publishers doing business with NetShelter disclose any and all information that is being collected from Internet consumers on their website, including data gathered from banners and other forms of advertising being served on their website. Finally, NetShelter encourages the websites in our network to provide links to all advertisers gathering information from Internet consumers in their respective privacy statements. Please note that the NetShelter's privacy policy applies only to the information we collect and not to that collected by sites with which we may do business. We encourage you to always read the privacy policies of the sites you visit. If you have particular concerns about any website advertising with NetShelter with respect to privacy issues, please contact privacy@NetShelter.net. 

**Children's Privacy**   
As of April 21, 2000 the children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA") became effective. The regulations apply to the online collection of personal information from children under the age of 13. NetShelter is very sensitive to the issue of children's privacy and makes every effort to protect the privacy of children using the Internet. NetShelter's web site, products, and services are not developed for or directed at children. Our policy is not to permit anyone under the age of 13 to do business with us. If you believe your child has provided NetShelter with any personally identifiable data by registering at NetShelter's web site, please contact privacy@NetShelter.net to have them removed.   
We also request that all websites using our advertising network disclose in their privacy statements any and all information regarding the collection of information from children. 

**Involvement with Industry Partners**  
NetShelter is committed to helping protect consumer privacy on the Internet and, as such, we actively monitor consumer privacy issues. Further evidence of NetShelter's commitment to consumer privacy is our involvement with the following privacy advocacy groups: 

**BBBOnline & Truste **  
NetShelter fully supports and endorses the BBBOnline and Truste online privacy programs. For more information on the specifics of their respective policies and programs please go to www.bbbonline.com or www.truste.com. 

**Changes to the Privacy Policy**   
Your understanding of our privacy policy is of prime importance to NetShelter, but due to the changing nature of consumer needs and our business, NetShelter reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time without notice.Â  As such, we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically to note any changes that may have occurred.
