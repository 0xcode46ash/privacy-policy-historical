# neuvoo. Your job search starts here.

By using NEUVOO, you agree to the following terms: 

##  1\. Content 

All the jobs contained in NEUVOO's search results, or linked from those results, have been provided by external websites over whom NEUVOO exercises no control. NEUVOO automatically indexes all the jobs from external sources and assumes no responsibility for the content of any job listing.

Our team will investigate and take action to fix the problem swiftly. 

##  4\. Guarantee 

NEUVOO's team is working hard to maintain a high quality of indexed jobs. Because we index a lot of content, we cannot guarantee the validity and genuineness of all the jobs we index. If you find any jobs that look "spammy", "fishy" or "expired", email us at "contact@neuvoo.com" with a short description of the problem. Our team will investigate and take action to fix the problem swiftly.

Here’s what you need to know about our privacy policy:

##  1\. Cookies 

We (NEUVOO) use cookies. “Cookies” are text-based files that a server (NEUVOO) and a browser (YOU) share to keep track of certain events or preferences. We use cookies for the following:

Cookies are temporary and anonymous, and can be deleted from your browser at any point. 

##  2\. Personal information 

NEUVOO collects anonymous events for analyticcal purposes. We also collect your email address after a "search" (keyword and location) when you register to "email alerts". We store this in a database to send you daily email alerts based on your job search preferences.

Here’s what you need to know about our security measures:

##  1\. Protection 

We continuously test our system for potential breaches. We have dedicated resources monitoring our servers for any potential intrusions or hack attempts. We use SSL when necessary and have strict access control policies within our organization. We use Firewall on sensitive servers and run anti-virus programs regularly. No system is 100% secure, so we dedicate resources to ensure that we minimize the risk of leaks, breaches, or hacks. 

##  2\. Links 

As a search engine, most clicks will forward users to the source website. We do our best to remove sources containing malware, excessive advertising, phishing strategies, or any other method potentially harming our users or degrading their job search experience. If you run into a link that contains any of these qualities, please send an email to "contact@neuvoo.com". We will investigate and take action swiftly.
