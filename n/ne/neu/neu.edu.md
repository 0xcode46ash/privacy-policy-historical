# Online Privacy Statement | Northeastern University

## Welcome

**December 18, 2015:** Northeastern University is committed to delivering information services that recognize and respect users’ privacy concerns. This Privacy Statement describes how we recognize these concerns and uphold our commitments to address them.  This Privacy Statement is intended to inform you of our general policies and practices regarding our collection, use, and disclosure of the information that you submit to us and that we collect from you during your use of Northeastern.edu, neu.edu, the myNeu portal, and our mobile applications (“Services”). 

The types of information we collect may vary depending on the specific site you visit or application you use. Accordingly, this Privacy Statement is intended to be a general statement and may be supplemented by more specific privacy policies that pertain to personal information exclusively associated with a specific department, unit or function. 

Additional and/or different practices may apply with respect to data collected from participants in university-based or sponsored research studies that are governed by a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board, and in those cases the provisions of the Informed Consent form will govern and may supersede those set out in this Privacy Statement.

### WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?

**Personal Information We Collect**

**Other Information We Collect**

Personal Information does not include technical information such as unique device identifiers, randomly assigned unique identifiers in cookies, mobile device name, timestamp, IP addresses, and other similar information that we may collect.

For example, your web browser automatically sends us the type of computing device and operating system you are using. We may also collect and maintain the IP (internet protocol) address used by your computing device. In addition, we may collect the dates and times you access Services, URLs requested, file names sent or received, search strings, and errors generated. We may also collect other information to assist us in maintaining or managing our systems, diagnosing problems, assisting you with a help request, or informing investigations.

### HOW DO WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION?

We collect Personal Information as follows:

  * When you use our Services
  * When you voluntarily provide it to us
  * When you register and set up an account 
  * When you communicate with us
  * When you contact us offline or submit information to us offline
  * When you provide it through our website
  * From publicly available sources
  * From third-parties



We use data collection technologies to collect information about your use of our Services.  Third parties, widgets, and hosted solutions that we use on our website may use the following technologies for features, services, advertising, or analytics:

_Browser cookies_ are small pieces data placed on your computer as you navigate websites with your browser.  Browser cookies allow websites and various third-parties to distinguish your device from others by having the cookie consist of a unique identifier or other data.  Cookies can have many uses, such as to target advertising as well as to enable website functionality and for security.  We use both session cookies (which expire after you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our website may not work properly.

_Local shared objects_ (such as "Flash" cookies) are associated with non-Browser software like Flash Player.  Local shared objects can be used like cookies to distinguish your device from others, but will not be deleted or blocked using browser cookie controls.  You can visit adobe.com for guidance on how to delete and block Flash cookies.

_HTML5 local storage_ is another way that browsers can distinguish your device from others as well as remember data that may be important for the functioning of the website.  Typically HTML5 local storage is only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted.  You should check your browser software for how to delete HTML5 local storage in your particular case.

_Web beacons_ are image files that are used by third-party advertisers, analytics companies, and others.  Web beacons are embedded in web pages you visit and cause your browser to share its IP address with the third-party source of the beacon, together with any cookies associated with that third-party.  Web beacons can be used with or without cookies.  Blocking cookies will not stop your IP address from being shared through the use of beacons.

_E-tags_ are used to prevent duplicative downloading of content to your browser, which can enhance browser performance.  E-tags use unique identifiers for content that can also be used to distinguish your browser in certain instances from others.  Typically e-tags are only deleted if all Internet history, cache, and cookies are deleted.  You should check your browser software for how to delete e-tags in your particular case.

Our mobile applications may use the following technologies for features, services, advertising, or analytics:

  * Collection of device identifiers, such as Android ID, MAC address, or UDID
  * Collection of geolocation, including precise geolocation
  * Device name
  * Collection of platform specific identifiers such as Apple's Identifier for Advertising and Identifier for Vendor, and Android ID or Android's advertising identifier
  * Collection of carrier-related information including the name of your wireless carrier, and IDs related to the cell phone hardware in your phone as well as the network to which the device is connected
  * IP address
  * Mobile phone number
  * App-specific cookies



_Other technologies_.  Our website and mobile apps may occasionally use other technologies both for purposes of advertising as well as for features and services.

**Social Network Widgets**

Our Services may include social network sharing widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about your interactions with our web pages that you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. Information is transmitted from your browser and may include an identifier assigned by the social network or third party, information about your browser type, operating system, device type, IP address, and the URL of the web page where widget appears. If you use social network tools or visit social networking sites, you should read their privacy disclosures, to learn what information they collect, use, and share.

### HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?

We limit the collection of Personal Information to that which is required in order to provide services to you.  We collect personal information in order to deliver and better tailor the features, performance and support of our services and Website, and to offer you additional information about our services, personalized to you, your role, and interests at Northeastern.  Uses of some common categories of information are described below.

**Use of the NUID Number**

The NUID Number is used as the student identification number and, for faculty and staff, as an administrative system identifies.

**Use of the SSN**

We are required by law to collect SSNs from:

  * students;
  * those who are employed by and/or paid by the University;
  * individuals applying for or receiving financial aid; and
  * Sponsored Account applicants (last 4 digits only)



**Use of Contact Information for Emergency/Crisis Notification**

Any and all contact information you provide, such as home telephone numbers, cellular numbers, and email addresses may be used to notify you of an emergency or crisis that may affect you and/or the University community.

Your emergency contact information may be used to notify your designated emergency contact(s) of an emergency or crisis that may affect you and/or the University community.

### HOW DO WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION?

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, rent, or share your Personal Information with third parties.  We may disclose your Personal Information to: 

  * departments within the University;
  * third parties involved in assisting the University in providing services, including but not limited to employee background checks, administrative services, and technical services;
  * local, state and/or Federal agencies, pursuant to valid legal process; and
  * other parties as we deem reasonably necessary in order to protect and defend our rights, or the rights or safety of third parties



**How Personal Information is Shared Within Northeastern**

We use your Personal Information primarily to enable delivery, personalization, and improvement of services at Northeastern.  Personal Information may be shared with other departments and business units at the University to the extent necessary to deliver and improve services offered or to satisfy local, state and federal laws and regulations.

**How Personal Information is Shared Outside Northeastern**

We may share your Personal Information with others outside of the University, such as third-party providers, vendors, and others acting on behalf of the University, for a variety of purposes, for example, to the extent necessary to deliver,  improve and tailor services to you. Third parties who receive Personal Information are generally contractually prohibited from using or sharing Personal Information for any purpose other than providing services to users.  Northeastern does not sell Personal Information to third-party data brokers. The University may share Personal Information pursuant to valid legal process, to detect, prevent or investigate fraud or system or network security issues, or to protect the safety or rights of the university and other third parties.

**Sharing Cookies and Technical Information with Third Parties**

The University has relationships with authorized third-party providers whose services are accessed through the myNeu portal or other webservices. In order to facilitate your access to these services, the University may automatically send one or more of your cookies to the third-party site or service so that you may access third-party services without re-entering your myNeu user ID and password, or other required information, each time.

We use the information we get from web analytics tools such as Google Analytics, Inspectlet, and Crazy Egg to improve the user experience or our website. These tools collect data such as browser information, operating system, and page views through the implementation of session cookies or persistent cookies. Each tool creates a persistent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user. The cookie is only used by Northeastern University and/or the software publisher of the respective tool. The software publisher’s ability to use and share information collected about your visits to Northeastern University websites is restricted by each software publisher’s Terms of Use and Privacy Policies.

Digital Marketing and Ad Networks 

We may sometimes use "interest-based" advertisements also known as "online behavioral advertising." Online behavioral advertising is advertising that is directed to you based, at least in part, on your Internet browsing behavior across websites and over time. Although we do not share Personal Information with the third parties that conduct interest-based advertising operations on our behalf, these third parties and their affiliates do collect certain information as a result of their javascript "tags" and other technologies being used on our website. The information that they collect includes the names of web pages you view (URL's), unique identifiers, your IP address, timestamp, and certain types of technical information.  A longer list of some of the technologies used for advertising and other purposes on our website and in our mobile apps are listed under the "Technologies Used" section.

Third Parties May Collect Personal Information from Other Sources. 

Some third parties involved in advertising operations may maintain their own proprietary consumer databases that allow them to personally identify or track website visitors. Other third parties have proprietary technologies to determine what additional devices you may use, on which it can display relevant advertisements.

Do Not Track 

Do-Not-Track is a public-private initiative that has developed a “flag” or signal that an Internet user may activate in the user’s browser software to notify websites that the user does not wish to be “tracked” by third-parties as defined by the initiative. The online community has not agreed on what actions, if any, should be taken by the websites that receive the “do not track” signal, and therefore Do-Not-Track is not yet standardized. Our website does not alter its behavior or change its services when it receives a “do-not-track” flag or signal from your browser.

Your Privacy and Ad Choices  

You can make decisions about your privacy and the ads you receive. You can control whether companies serve you on-line behavioral advertising by visiting the Digital Advertising Alliance website and using its opt-out: http://www.aboutads.info/choices/.  The DAA opt-out requires that cookies not be blocked in your browser.

As an alternative to the DAA opt–out, you can also elect to block browser cookies from first parties (such as those from our website) and browser cookies from third parties (such as advertisers) by using the cookie blocking options built into your browser software.  If you block browser cookies, some parts of our website may not function correctly.  Also, blocking cookies will not stop third-parties from collecting IP address, data stored in "Flash" cookies, and certain other types of technical information that may uniquely identify your browser.

### Email

**Email Messages**

If you send us email, we may share your email address and message content with others inside the University, and with persons and organizations outside the University, to the extent it is necessary to process and/or address your inquiry, or serve your needs.

**Forwarding Email: Students’ Private Email Address**

If you forward email from your University-assigned email address to a private (non-Northeastern University) email address, we may send email to either or both addresses. We may also share your private email address with service providers inside and outside the University. 

**Faculty and Staff University-Assigned Email Addresses**

Faculty and staff University-assigned email addresses appear in the Northeastern email directory, and are visible to all students, faculty, staff, administrators and others who have authorized access to the directory.  They are also publically-available through the directory at northeastern.edu.  We may share faculty and staff University-assigned email address with service providers inside and outside the University and do so according to university policies.  Faculty and staff must comply with university policies and ensure that all business transactions are conducted solely through university approved systems.

**Telephone Numbers**

If you provide your telephone number(s), we may share these numbers with service providers inside and outside the University.

**What Are My Choices Regarding Collection of Information?**
