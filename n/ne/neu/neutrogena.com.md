This Privacy Policy tells you how Neutrogena.com collects, uses, and discloses personally identifiable information that you provide via this website. 

Neutrogena.com is intended for visitors over the age of 12. Neutrogena.com will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from visitors who are age 12 or under. 

Before collecting personally identifiable information from you, Neutrogena.com will specify the purpose for which the personally identifiable information will be used. You will have a choice as to whether or not to provide such data to Neutrogena.com. Please be aware, however, that if you decide not to provide that information, you may not be able to use some of the user convenience features of this website. 

Neutrogena.com will require business partners, contractors and affiliates with access to your personally identifiable information to agree to use that information in compliance with this policy and only for the purposes we have identified to you. 

If you wish to correct or delete your personally identifiable information, please send your request by e-mail to ntgweb@neuus.jnj.com. We will make reasonable efforts to comply with your request. 

Neutrogena.com will use reasonable measures to protect the personally identifiable information you give us from unauthorized access or disclosure. 

We use personally identifiable information collected through this website in a number of ways that are specified at the time that the information is requested.

Your personally identifiable information collected by this web site will not be sold to any third parties. We may sometimes analyze data that we collect in the aggregate to share with other Johnson & Johnson affiliates, business partners, and third parties regarding our website visitors (e.g., over two-thirds of our visitors are female). Such information can be important for a number of purposes, including research, marketing, advertising, developing website content for our visitors, attracting sponsors for prizes and contests, and so on.
