The Neat Company takes your privacy very seriously and we will never share your personal information with anyone.

Will you sell/share my information with others?

No. We respect your privacy and will never share your information to any unauthorized third party. If we ever share your information with a trusted partner, you will always be asked if you want to opt in to any correspondence with them. 

  
Why do you want to know my name and email address?  
  
We need this information to check your billing information, address your shipping package and to mail you the order confirmation. We also use your email address to send information about critical security updates. If you do not want to receive any correspondence from us, please contact us and we will be glad to comply with any requests you have. You should also check for unsubscription information in any email you receive from us.

  
Why do you want to know my credit card number and street address?  
  
We need this information to verify your billing status and then bill you for your purchases. We will then use your street address to ship you the products you purchase. We will never give out this sensitive information to anyone. It is only collected for billing and shipping. It is stored in a secure server and can be accessed only by a few trusted employees who handle billing. Click here for our billing policy.

  
How do you make sure my credit card information is secure?  
  
Again, we will never give out any details related to your credit card to anyone. They are stored in a secure server away from our office, and only selected personnel in our billing department have access to this information.

  
How do you use my personal information?  
  
Apart from using this information for shipping, we primarily use your personal information such as geographic locality and date/time purchased to analyze the buying habits of our customers and recognize marketing trends.

  
How can I start or stop receiving email from you?  
  
To join or leave our mailing list, please contact us.

  
Who can I contact at NeatReceipts about my privacy concerns?  
  
Please contact us and our customer support staff will be glad to address any concerns you have about your privacy.
