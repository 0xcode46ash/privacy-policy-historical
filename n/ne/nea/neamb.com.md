We use the above non-personal information to diagnose technical problems and track user interests so that we can provide content that interests you. 

**B.**  Children 

The NEA MBC website is a general website, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to provide us with their personal information.

**C.**  External Links

This Privacy Policy applies only to the NEA MBC and NEA Academy websites. It does not cover any websites that are linked to or from the NEA MBC or NEA Academy websites for which we are not responsible (“linked-sites”). These linked sites will have their own policies and practices which may be different from ours. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the policies and practices of the linked sites especially if you provide personal information to them.

**D.**  Cookies

To enhance your experience on our sites, our web pages use “cookies.” Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer’s (or mobile device’s) browser to store your basic information about you. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by registering on our site. Once you choose to provide a web page with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies to tailor the articles, products and services that are offered to you.

Please note that you can control which cookies you accept. You can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website’s server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser. You may find that some parts of our websites will not function properly and you may not be able to obtain certain products and services if you have refused or limited the use of cookies.

Additionally, NEA MBC allows third parties who advertise or provide content on the NEA MBC and NEA Academy websites to use cookies. Third parties’ use of cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, and is not governed by this Privacy Policy.
