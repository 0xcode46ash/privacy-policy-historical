  * Privacy Policy



The Neat Company takes your privacy very seriously and we will never share your personal information with anyone.

Will you sell/share my information with others?

No. We respect your privacy and will never share your information to any unauthorized third party. If we ever share your information with a trusted partner, you will always be asked if you want to opt in to any correspondence with them. 

  
Why do you want to know my personal information?  
  
We use the information you provide (name, address, phone number and email address)  to complete your order and  email the order confirmation. We also use your email address to send information about critical security updates, new product information and special offers and promotions from Neat Company and our partners. We do not share you information with other companies.   If you do not want to receive any correspondence from us, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/our-company/policies/email-preferences) to unsubscribe. If you received an email from us and you no longer wish to receive such messages, click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email.

  
Why do you want to know my credit card number and street address?  
  
We need this information to verify your billing status and then bill you for your purchases. We will then use your street address to ship you the products you purchase. We will never give out this sensitive information to anyone. It is only collected for billing and shipping. It is stored in a secure server and can be accessed only by a few trusted employees who handle billing. Click here for our billing policy.

  
How do you make sure my credit card information is secure?  
  
Again, we will never give out any details related to your credit card to anyone. They are stored in a secure server away from our office, and only selected personnel in our billing department have access to this information.

  
How do you use my personal information?  
  
Apart from using this information for shipping, we primarily use your personal information such as geographic locality and date/time purchased to analyze the buying habits of our customers and recognize marketing trends.

  
How can I start or stop receiving email from you?

Who can I contact at NeatReceipts about my privacy concerns?
