Nearpod Privacy Policy

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before accessing or using the Nearpod website or any of the Nearpod mobile applications.  

By accessing or registering to the Nearpod website, and/or by downloading any of the Nearpod mobile applications, you agree to become bound by this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, then you may not access the Nearpod website or use any of our products or services.  

Personal Identifiable Information from Children We do not intentionally collect any personal identifiable information from users under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian or teacher and believe that your child or student has provided Nearpod with Personal Identifiable Information, you should notify us at [support@nearpod.com](mailto:support@nearpod.com)  so that we may immediately delete the information from our servers.  

Our Privacy Policy describes how we use any personally identifiable information that is collected when you register and complete our form to activate your account. The Nearpod Materials includes mobile applications, website and its contents, and hardware equipment. Not all of the opportunities, methods, or technologies that can be used to collect or receive user information or Submissions, as described below, are in use or released, but may become used or made available as we release new features and offerings. Certain matters referred to in this Privacy Policy are dealt with in more detail in our Terms and Conditions. We recommend that you read this Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions prior to enrolling and start using Nearpod and Nearpod Materials.  

What types of information do we collect?  

As used below:

-”You” or “your” will refer to the user in charge of implementing Nearpod.

-”We” or “our” or “Nearpod” refers to Nearpod.  

During the Nearpod sign-up process, we may collect the following information from the user in charge of implementing Nearpod: First Name, Last Name, Institution Name, Title, E-mail Address, Phone Number, Address, City, State, ZIP code, Country, SchoolType, District, Approximate number of mobile devices in school, Twitter, Blog, etc.  

Nearpod and Nearpod Materials may offer conversation pages, chat rooms, social community environments, profile pages, as well as other interactive features in which you may provide us with your Submissions. If you provide personal information when you use any of these features, that personal information shall be privately posted on the Nearpod Materials. You are responsible for your communications, and are responsible for the consequences of their posting. Further, during the registration process, we will ask you to create a “username” to be used to access your account and the features of Nearpod and Nearpod Materials. Should you choose to post to the Nearpod Materials, make comments, give feedback, or provide us with other types of “Submissions,” we may use your member name to identify or credit you as the source of such Submissions.  

Submissions and your username may be used in perpetuity, even if you elect to terminate, delete, or remove your account or request us to remove your personally identifiable information. Please see our “Terms and Conditions” to read more about how “Submissions” are treated and handled.  

Newsletters  

Nearpod may be offering an e-mail newsletter to the user in charge of implementing Nearpod. To sign up to receive regular e-mails, you will be required to opt-in to receive said e-mails. This information will be used in aggregate form to assess general user interest in various internal products and services, and your personal and contact information will not be passed to any other organization. If you choose to sign up for a mailing list, you will receive regular e-mails, including alerts about new articles, industry trends, and/or other offerings.  

Will information be collected automatically by technology?  

We do not collect any kind of non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookie technology or IP numbers that track the audience. In HTML e-mails that we may send you, we may use technical methods for a number of purposes, including determining whether you have opened or forwarded those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e- mails. These technical methods may enable us to collect and use information in a form that is personally identifiable.  

Notwithstanding any other statements or representations here or elsewhere on our site, Nearpod reserves its right to disclose any information in its possession if it is required to do so by law, or it believes, in good faith, that such a disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, defend its rights or property, or to respond to an emergency situation.  

How you can access, change, or delete personally identifiable information?  

You can contact us to access, change, or remove any personally identifiable information that we have collected from you by sending an e-mail to support@nearpod.com. Please include your username and e-mail address so that we can better assist you with your inquiry or request. Please be advised that (a) requesting the removal of or not providing personally identifiable information may result in the termination, removal, or blocking of your account, registration, and/or access to the Nearpod Materials and (b) change of personal information may affect your use of the Nearpod Materials including the correctness of any results. We reserve the right to maintain archival copies of any personally identifiable information you have provided to us in a manner that will not allow it to be publicly used or accessed. Once you request a change or removal of your personally identifiable information and/or your account, we can give you no assurances that such information or account may be retrieved or reopened in the future.  

Nothing requires us to delete, block or remove any non-personally identifiable information from our Nearpod Materials or our databases, or any “Submissions” you have made even if they contain personally identifiable information from the user in charge of implementing Nearpod. All such information will be treated as a “Submission” under the “Terms and Conditions.”

We may amend our Privacy Policy at any time. We expect to amend our Privacy Policy from time to time as we change the registration procedure, possibly introduce or alter our offerings, change levels of user participation, and/or release new features. Nearpod elects the right in its sole discretion to remove or delete, temporarily or permanently, any and all information, including personally-identifiable and non-personally identifiable profile and registration information, Submissions (as defined in the “Terms and Conditions”), and any other information collected from or provided by you during and after installing Nearpod. Please note that, at all times, you should update your personal information to provide us with current e-mail addresses.
