## Privacy Policy

Wushibu LLC (referred to as "Wushibu") take your privacy seriously. Our Privacy Policy governs the collection and use of any information you provided to Wushibu. Please read the following carefully for our Privacy Policy.

###  Information Collection 

Our Services are primarily designed to help you share information with others. Most of the information you provide to us is information you agree to make public. When you create an account to use services provided by Wushibu, you provide some personal information, such as full name, username, password, email, and the like. You may provide Wushibu with additional information, such as a bio, homepage, location, gender, pictures, status and the like. By default, the information provided by you is almost always to be shared with public but you can make the information more private using settings provided by our Service. 

You may choose to indicate your location by check-in at a place or add a venue, and the location information may appear in your status update, and in your profile. If you do so, we may also save exact coordinates to help improve our service. However, please be really careful when labeling or tagging your location or check-in as residence or home, since your location or check-ins may be visible to your followers and/or public. If you still want to label or tag a place or checin-in as residence or home, we recommend the following ways to protect your privacy: (1) obscure the coordinate of the place by moving the pin on the map before add venue or check-in; (2) do not input any information which can be associated with you (e.g., your real name, user name, phone no, etc) in the place name or street or tag. Please note, you can control who can view your location information by editing your privacy setting. In addition, you can delete your check-in history or status posted before anytime from the website or from the mobile applicaitons.
