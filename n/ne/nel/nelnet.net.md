# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

Privacy Policy Effective Date January 1, 2006

Nelnet understands how important privacy is to you, and we are committed to providing you with extraordinary customer service. This commitment includes protecting the personal information you entrust to us by adhering to strict guidelines.  This privacy policy explains what information we collect about you, how we collect it, why we collect it, and with whom we share the information.  This policy applies to both our current customers and our former customers.  Nelnet reserves the right to change this policy, and we will communicate any changes to you, as required by law.  The effective date of this policy is January 1, 2006, and the practices described in this policy replace all prior policies regarding privacy of customer information issued by Nelnet or any of our affiliates listed below in the area designated as companies this policy applies to (“Nelnet Companies”).  **Important Note:**   If Nelnet services but does not own your education loan, the privacy policy of the lender that owns your loan applies instead.  As your loan servicer, Nelnet complies with your lender’s policy. 

Nelnet will not share your personally identifiable information with unaffiliated companies for marketing purposes that are unrelated to educational or financial products and services.  We do share information with companies that assist us in servicing your account, organizations that assist us in communicating our products, services, or special offers to you, and unaffiliated companies that offer educational or financial products and services.  As our customer, you may choose how you want us to handle your personally identifiable information.

**Online Information**

We at Nelnet are committed to providing you a useful and enjoyable online experience, and to protecting your personal information during your visit. When you access a Nelnet Web site, you can be sure that your information is protected by the latest security and authentication techniques. We may collect information from your visit, in order to personalize and improve upon your experience with us, but all information we collect is treated as confidential. 

 

To access student loan account information and send email via our Web site, you will need a browser that supports the use of Secure Sockets Layer (Netscape 4.0or greater, MS Internet Explorer 5.0 or greater, etc). This encryption technology helps ensure the authenticity of you online sessions and secures data being transmitted over the public Internet. 

 

If you are using Netscape Navigator, your session is secured if a key appears in the lower left corner of your screen; when the session is not secure, the key will appear broken. Internet Explorer displays a lock icon in a locked position on the status bar when you enter a secure site. When you leave a secure Web site, Internet Explorer displays a lock in an unlocked position on the status bar. If the page you are viewing uses frames, you may not see the key or lock, but can simply right-click anywhere in the frame and select “Properties”. If the Web site address (URL) starts with “https” the “s” indicates a secure site or area of the site. 

 

When you enter a Nelnet Web site, you will pass through our security “firewall” and we identify the Internet Protocol (IP) address of you computer or handheld device, The IP address won’t identify you personally, but it will let us identify the device you’re using and we store IP addresses in case we need to track a connection for security purposes. 

 

Nelnet Web sites use cookies in several applications for navigational purposes. A cookie is a small text file placed on your hard drive (with your permission) by a Web page server. Accepting a cookie from a Nelnet Web site does not give Nelnet access to your computer of any personal information about you. Also, the type of cookies we use don’t get stored permanently in your computer – they expire immediately after you close your browser and are deleted. You can also set up your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set or to prevent cookies from being set. 

 

If you supply us with your email address we may let you know by email about other products and services and product enhancements that may be of interest to you. You will have the opportunity to tell us you don’t want ot receive future messages with each message you receive. If you send us an email question or comment, we will use your email address to reply to you and we will temporarily store your email address, your message and our reply for quality assurance or to satisfy applicable laws and regulations. When we collect your email address this way, we won’t use it for marketing our products and services unless you have given us permission. If you are not comfortable that your email system is secure, you can always contact Customer Service by telephone. 

 

We don’t knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our Web sites about children under age 13. If we find out we have collected such information we will take all reasonable measures to delete that information from our system as soon as possible. We are not responsible for the collection and use of information by companies or individuals unaffiliated with us whose Web sites may contain links to ours, including vendors where you may shop. 

 

Please note that when you shop with a vendor who is linked to a Nelnet Web site, even though you may have started your visit at the Nelnet site, and even though Nelnet pages may still appear, your transactions are completed with a separate organization, not with Nelnet. We don’t share your personal information with them, but information you choose to share with them will fall under their privacy policies, which we encourage you to review. We carefully select other organizations in an effort to give you the value and excellent customer service you expect from Nelnet. 

 

**What information we collect and how we collect it**

“Nonpublic personal information” is information about you that is not generally available to the public and that Nelnet obtains through providing a product or service to you.  This information is collected to enable us to serve you effectively and efficiently. One type of nonpublic personal information we may collect is identification information such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone number, birth date, and Social Security number. We also collect financial information such as your income and assets.  This information is collected on loan applications and other forms.  We maintain information about your transactions with us and with our affiliates. Transactional information may include, for example, your account balance and payment history.  We also receive non-transactional information from third parties, such as credit bureaus.  This may include your credit history, credit score, or information you authorize us to obtain from others.  For example, when you obtain a federal education loan, you authorize Nelnet to obtain enrollment information from the school you are attending or plan to attend.  We collect information when you use our Internet Web sites and services, communicate with us via e-mail, or register or apply for our products and services. 

**Why we collect information**

We collect information about you to identify you as our customer and manage your account. This enables us to determine your eligibility for a loan and process the application. Your information is used to protect your account from unauthorized access and to process transactions to your account.  We use it to contact you about products and services, collect on your account when necessary, and to comply with various legal and regulatory requirements.   

**How we share information externally, as permitted by law**

In limited situations, Nelnet is permitted by law to share nonpublic personal information about you with companies unaffiliated with our organization in order to do business with you. For example, we are permitted to share information with the following types of organizations:

·    Service providers and business partners – These organizations include lenders that provide funding for loans, companies that originate loans and process loan transactions for us, and vendors that provide mail services, computer programming, and product and service delivery. 

·    Marketing service providers - These organizations assist us in communicating information about products, services, and special offers to you. 

We select our service providers and business partners very carefully.  These organizations receive limited information about you as we deem necessary to perform their functions and are always required to maintain the confidentiality of the information.  We restrict their use of the information to the purposes we authorize.

Nelnet may also share nonpublic personal information about you with parties unaffiliated with our organization in other circumstances, such as when you request that we do so or when required by law.  For example, Nelnet is required by law to provide nonpublic personal information about a customer who has a federal education loan to the school the student is attending, the guaranty agency, the United States Department of Education, and national credit bureaus.  Furthermore, Nelnet may share your information in response to a court order or subpoena, at the request of a law enforcement agency, or when we suspect fraud or criminal activity.

**How we share information within Nelnet**

The Nelnet Companies are involved in a variety of businesses related to helping families make their educational dreams possible.  Among the Nelnet Companies, we may share transactional information about you in order to provide you a loan or other product or service or to service your existing account. We may also share non-transactional information about you among the Nelnet Companies, such as information we receive from credit bureaus or other unaffiliated parties, in order to determine if we or our partners have another product or service that may be of interest to you.  Non-transactional information may include your creditworthiness, payment history with other businesses, and employment history.  You may direct us not to share such non-transactional information about you among the Nelnet Companies and with our affiliated companies by submitting to us a completed [Nelnet Privacy Option form ](https://web.archive.org/includes/privacy.pdf)and checking option number 1.

**How we share information with educational or financial organizations**

Nelnet may also share nonpublic personal information about you with parties unaffiliated with our organization that offer educational or financial products and services.  These parties may include, but are not limited to, schools, scholarship search groups, credit organizations, insurance providers, financial institutions, and securities companies.  You may direct us not to share your nonpublic personal information with these types of parties for these purposes by submitting to us a completed [Nelnet Privacy Option form](https://web.archive.org/includes/privacy.pdf) and checking option number 2.

**Previous selections of option number 1 or 2**
