# NESTA - Privacy

## Privacy and data protection policy

To operate efficiently, we must collect information about people, with who we work. These may include members of the public, current, past and prospective employees, funded bodies, and suppliers. We may also be legally required to collect and use information to comply with our statutory obligations.

We are registered with the Information Commissioner to process personal data. We are named as a data controller under the register kept by the Information Commissioner in accordance with section 19 of the Act.

To respect your privacy, we process your personal data in accordance with the eight data protection principles.

  1. Personal data shall be processed fairly and lawfully.
  2. Personal data shall be obtained only for one or more specified and lawful purposes, and shall not be further processed in any manner incompatible with that purpose or those purposes.
  3. Personal data shall be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purpose or purposes for which they are processed.
  4. Personal data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
  5. Personal data processed for any purpose or purposes shall not be kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.
  6. Personal data shall be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects under this Act.
  7. Appropriate technical and organisational measures shall be taken against unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.
  8. Personal data shall not be transferred to a country or territory outside the European Economic Area unless that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.



  
The Act refers to the term 'personal data'. For information held by NESTA, this means any recorded information held by us and from which a living individual can be identified. It may include:

  * name and job title;
  * contact information such as telephone numbers, addresses and emails;
  * age, disability status, ethnicity, gender and nationality;
  * occupation and company details;
  * other information relevant to our HR function.



It will include any expression of opinion about a living individual - or any indication of our intentions about that individual.

We may use this information for the following reasons:

  * to carry out our statutory functions;
  * licensing and registration;
  * complaints and dispute handling;
  * investigations;
  * research;
  * improving our services;
  * sending information, which we think may be of interest to you;
  * staff administration including HR functions;
  * to pass your details to accountants, consultants and other professionals for obtaining professional advice and complying with our contractual obligations;
  * complying with our legal obligations.
