# Nest | The Learning Thermostat | Privacy Statement

## Privacy Statement

#### At Nest, we take your privacy seriously.

This document explains what kind of information Nest collects and stores, including Personally Identifiable Information (information that can be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person).

To view our Web Site Privacy Policy, [click here.](http://support.nest.com/customer/portal/articles/215234-nest-privacy-policy)

##### We pledge to:

  1. _Be transparent_ about the different types of information we collect and how we use them.
  2. _Ask your permission_ before sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for purposes other than to provide Nest’s services, and to do so only when we think they will provide you with a welcome additional service.
  3. _Use best-in-class data security tools_ to keep your data safe and protect the Nest Learning Thermostat from unauthorized access.



If you have any questions, please contact us us at [privacy@nest.com](mailto:privacy@nest.com).

##### What information does the Nest Learning Thermostat collect?

The Nest Learning Thermostat collects:

  * Information input during setup
  * Environmental data from Nest’s sensors
  * Direct temperature adjustments to the device
  * Heating and cooling usage information
  * Technical information from the device 



_Information input during setup_ : When you install the Nest Learning Thermostat, you’ll be asked several questions about your schedule to help create an initial program of temperature settings. For example, we’ll ask questions like, “Is Nest located in a home or business?”. We’ll also ask for your zip code so that Nest can retrieve weather information for your neighborhood. In addition, Nest pulls information directly from your heating and cooling (HVAC) system to learn its capabilities – such as if it has heating and cooling or is a heating-only system. Answering these questions helps us to set up an initial program that will keep you comfortable.

_Environmental data from Nest’s sensors_ : We collect data from several sensors built into the Nest Learning Thermostat. These sensors collect data such as current temperature, humidity and ambient light in the room. They can also sense whether something in the room is moving. By recording this information, the Nest Learning Thermostat can make you comfortable when you are at home and save energy when you are away. For example, if Nest senses a light being switched on or that you’ve entered the room after an extended period of time, it can adjust the setting to a preferred temperature, based on an assumption that you’ve just woken up or returned home. Similarly, if the light goes off or no one is moving in the room, Nest may turn the temperature down sometimes to save you energy.

_Direct temperature adjustments to the device_ : If you change the temperature on Nest, it records and feeds that information to the Nest algorithms to learn your desired comfort level under different situations.

_Heating and cooling usage information_ : Every time your system turns on and off, Nest records the time and duration during which it was on in order to offer you features such as usage history.

_Technical information from the device_ : In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with Nest, we record your Nest model and serial number, software version, and technical information such as battery charge level.

##### What _**additional information**_ does Nest collect and store when a user connects their device to the internet?

To access your Nest Learning Thermostat over the Internet from a computer, a smartphone or a tablet, you will need to connect it to your Wi-Fi network. During setup, the Nest Learning Thermostat will ask for your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password to connect to the Internet. It will save this information on the device, along with your IP address, so that you can access it and control it from your computer, smartphone or tablet, and so that it can communicate with Nest servers and download software updates.

Once connected to your Wi-Fi network, your Nest Learning Thermostat regularly uploads to Nest cloud servers the data mentioned above (excluding your Wi-Fi password) to provide you with the service.

Additionally, when you create a Nest Account, we collect and store your email address. From that point forward, your email address is used for communications from Nest.

Like most Internet sites, we routinely record log entries (including information such as your IP address) and technical information (such as your browser type and version) when your browser, mobile device or Nest Learning Thermostat contacts our servers. These log files are used for troubleshooting and are stored on our cloud servers.

##### How does Nest use the information it collects?

We use this information to provide the Nest Services, which will over time make you more comfortable and help you save energy. This includes information and recommendations about your energy use. We may use your email address to send you this information, or to ask you to participate in surveys about your Nest use. We use service providers to perform some of these functions. Those service providers are restricted from sharing your information for any other purpose.

We use industry-standard methods to keep this information safe and secure while transmitted over your home network and through the Internet to our cloud servers.

##### With whom does Nest share my information?

Under no circumstance do we share Personally Identifiable Information for any commercial or marketing purpose unrelated to the delivery of the Nest service without asking you first. Period.

Our service technicians have supervised access to your information so they can answer your questions if you contact us for help and so they can monitor our servers for technical problems.

We may share your aggregated and anonymous information in a variety of ways, including to publish trends about energy use and conservation, to help utilities provide demand-response services and to generally improve our system. We’ve taken steps to ensure that the information cannot be linked back to you and we require our partners to keep all information in its anonymous form.

We will disclose information to law enforcement, or to comply with other legal requests, but only if provided with sufficient and appropriate legal process.  
If you select an outside party for the purchase, installation, or service of your Nest device and share your personal information, we cannot control the collection, storage or sharing of information collected by that party. For example, if you bought your thermostat from a retailer, they may collect personal information as part of the transaction. Or the party that installed the device may retain information that you provided to them to assist them in servicing the device if needed. Always check the privacy policies for any company that collects your personal information.

##### How long does Nest save my personal information and how can I delete it?

Nest stores your Personally Identifiable Information on Nest’s cloud servers for as long as you remain a Nest customer in order to provide you with the service.

As described above, some information is stored directly on the Nest device. All information is encrypted and cannot easily be accessed. You can delete the information on the Nest device by resetting it to the defaults (using Reset in the Settings menu).

If you want to delete your Personally Identifiable Information from Nest’s servers, please call us at 855-4MY-NEST. Because of the way we maintain certain services, after your information is deleted, backup copies may linger for some time before they are deleted.

We hope this answers all of your questions.  If you have any further questions, please contact us us at [privacy@nest.com](mailto:privacy@nest.com).

##### Policy active as of February 14, 2012: Edited to (1) Clarify that user information will be stored on the Nest device for longer than the three weeks stated in the previous policy.  This is to provide services over time to users who choose not to use the Wi-Fi functionality during the setup.  Data on the device can still be deleted at anytime using the Reset to Defaults menu; (2) Clarify that Nest may use user email addresses to send them customized energy usage information, recommendations, and surveys related to the Nest service; and (3) Combine all permitted sharing of Personally Identifiable Information under one heading.
