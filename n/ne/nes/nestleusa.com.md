Please note, the privacy practices set forth in this Privacy Policy are for this Web site only. Other Nestlé Web sites may have different practices (see appendix of sites). If you link to other Nestlé sites, please review the privacy policies posted at those sites. 

**Personal Information Use**

We collect personal information, like names, addresses, e-mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by our on-line visitors. The personal information you provide us is only used to fulfill your request.

Once on our mailing list, you may receive (by regular mail or e-mail) information about Nestlé's products, events, and services which may interest you. Individuals on our mailing list may also receive joint offers from Nestlé which feature products from other reputable organizations and companies. Please note, your information is not sold or transferred to these other companies. 

We may on occasion combine information we receive online with outside records to enhance our consumer profiles for our own marketing.
