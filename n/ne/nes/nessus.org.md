# Privacy Policy | Tenable Network Security

The Tenable Network Security group of web sites (the "Site") is owned and operated by Tenable Network Security, Inc. ("Tenable"). Tenable collects personally identifiable information and non-personal information on the Site. Tenable is committed to protecting your privacy. We have created this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect and use personally identifiable information. If you have any questions or concerns about Tenable's information collection and use practices, please send an email stating your questions or concerns, with the subject heading "Privacy Policy Question", to [marketing@tenable.com](mailto:marketing@tenable.com).

### WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?

We collect personally identifiable information about you if you choose to purchase, register or apply online for one of our products, services, promotions or other online activities. Our online activities include web seminars, support responses, user surveys, product demonstrations, registration for our partner program and access to downloadable software and documents. When you register or apply for one of our online activities, you complete a form that may require you to provide personally identifiable information, including your full name, email address and telephone number. To the extent you utilize our online store, you may also provide your credit card information and mailing address. 

### HOW DOES TENABLE USE MY INFORMATION?

We use your personally identifiable information to deliver the services you have requested, to evaluate your registration or application for our products and services, to process your request for information and to contact you if we need more information. We may use personally identifiable information to contact a user in connection with the user's inappropriate use of the Site. We may also use your email address, telephone number or mailing address:

  * for internal marketing purposes to obtain feedback on our products, the Site or on other aspects of our business;
  * to notify you of new products or services that we think may be of interest to you;
  * to send you promotional materials; and
  * to provide you with a newsletter.



If you prefer not to receive promotional materials, our email newsletter or other forms of communication, you may opt out by sending an email to the regional sales representative from whom you received the communication, asking us to drop you from our mailing or email lists. Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will not sell, rent, share or otherwise disclose to third parties the personally identifiable information collected on the Site. We may disclose your personally identifiable information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary to comply with the law. If we sell our company or all or substantially all its assets, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to the purchaser, which will be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. We may use a third party to process credit and debit card transactions, in which case we will allow such third party to access your personal information to charge you for any paid services you have authorized. We may also transfer your personal information to our authorized resellers for the purpose of further marketing our products to you.

We use anonymous information, such as aggregate data about visitors to the Site, to determine how to improve the Site, marketing and services, how visitors find out about the Site and which of our online services most interest visitors to the Site. We also may share anonymous information with third parties. This anonymous information cannot be used to identify you personally.

### DOES TENABLE COLLECT INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN?

We respect the sensitive nature of children's privacy online. You must be at least 18 years old to register, purchase or apply online for our products, services, promotions and other activities. If you are under the age of 18, please do not provide us with any information about yourself.

### WHAT TYPE OF SAFEGUARDS DOES TENABLE USE?

The security and confidentiality of your information is extremely important to us. We have implemented technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new technology and methods. Please be aware though that, despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.

### DOES TENABLE'S PRIVACY POLICY APPLY TO LINKED WEB SITES?

Our Privacy Policy applies solely to information collection practices on the Site. The Site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Tenable has no control or influence over the privacy practices of other web sites and that our Privacy Policy does not apply when you leave the Site. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of each web site you visit. 

### YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

A California resident who has provided us with personal information (a "California Customer") is entitled to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. If so, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, we will provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. 

Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy (including, but not limited to, sharing information with our third party resellers), we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. To prevent further disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on the Site. If you opt in to receive communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information.

California Customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing [marketing@tenable.com](mailto:marketing@tenable.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.

### MAY I CORRECT OR UPDATE THE INFORMATION COLLECTED ABOUT ME?

You may correct or update the personally identifiable information collected about you on the Site. To correct or update your personally identifiable information, please contact [marketing@tenable.com](mailto:marketing@tenable.com).

### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without notice. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post the changed Privacy Policy on the Site so that you are always aware of what type of information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it to third parties.

Effective Date: October 15, 2008
