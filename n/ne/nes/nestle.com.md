****Q8**** |      | **E Marketing - What is SPAMMING and what is Nestlé's position on SPAM e-mails?**  
---|---|---  
  
**A** |      |   
Spamming is where unsolicited e-mails are sent to you containing advertisements or marketing related materials without your consent.   
  |     |   
Nestlé does **NOT** send SPAM e-mails. Nestlé itself uses an anti-SPAM tool to protect our employees from SPAMMING. Sending e-mails without consent is illegal in many countries. Nestlé will not use your personal information (including your e-mail address) for direct marketing or follow-up communications unless you give us your **EXPRESS** permission. This is called "OPT-IN" consent.   
  |     |   
Also, Nestlé does not share your personal information with any Third Party (non-Nestlé Group) companies who will use your personal information for SPAM mails.   
  |     |   
Nestlé websites give you the opportunity to receive marketing information by e-mail. Every e-mail sent by Nestlé will give you the opportunity at any time to stop receiving marketing e-mails

****Q9**** |      | **How long does Nestlé keep your personal information?**  
---|---|---

****Q10**** |      | **What is Nestlé's policy on children using and communicating with our websites?**

  |     |   
We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under the age of 13 except on some of our children's websites.
