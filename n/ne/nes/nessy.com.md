# Privacy Policy - Nessy

**e-Safety**

Nessy is committed to maintaining a high level of online safety for children, parents and teachers. Nessy has no links to third party websites. We do not allow third-party companies to solicit or advertise to our users. Our intention is to keep Nessy free from any advertising of any sort.

Please help ensure that children have a safe and rewarding online experience by encouraging responsible information practices. To keep your child’s account safe, write their monkey name somewhere secret, and don’t tell anyone else these login details.

**The security of personal information**

The secrecy of your personal information is important to Nessy. Any information you provide will be held securely and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. All of the data collected, including usernames, passwords and any test results achieved, is stored on secure servers. Nessy will not sell or rent any of your personal information. We ask you to provide your email and telephone number solely to assist in coordinating and confirming your access to your Nessy online adventure (called a “Nessy Subscription” for short),

**What information do we collect?**

We collect information from you when you register on for a Nessy account, place an order, enter a contest, respond to a survey or communication such as e-mail, or participate in another Nessy.com feature.

When ordering or registering, we may ask you for your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, credit card information or other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

Like many websites, we use “cookies” to enhance your experience and gather information about visitors and visits to our websites. Please refer to the “Do we use ‘cookies’?” section below for information about cookies and how we use them.

If you decide to purchase a 1-year subscription to a Nessy Subscription your full name, email address, credit card billing information including mailing address will be required at the time of purchase. That information is not stored by Nessy, but is collected by PayPal for the purpose of processing payments made to Nessy. That information is safeguarded with appropriate security, and is not retained upon completion of the purchase unless you have set up a PayPal account. A PayPay account is not required to make a purchase.

**How do we protect visitor information?**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorised access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online. Your personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. When you place orders or access your personal information, we offer the use of a secure server. All sensitive/credit information you supply is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our databases to be only accessed as stated above.

**How do we use your information?**

We may use the information we collect from you when you register, purchase products, enter a contest or promotion, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other features in the following ways:

**Do we use cookies?**

Yes. Nessy Applications require cookies and will not function without them.

Cookies are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services. We also use cookies to help us compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

We may contract with third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and improve our business.
