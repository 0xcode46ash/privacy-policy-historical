# Neoseeker - Privacy Policy

|  |  |  **Neoseeker Privacy Policy**

Neoseeker and its Operators, Neo Era Media, Inc. understand and respect the need for the privacy of its users. To keep you informed of our privacy policies, we have provided this document disclosing Neo Era Media's intent, purpose and use of possibly private information, and detailing the methods of gathering of such information. 

Neoseeker works with a third party (Rydium) that serves ads to the site. To find out more about how [**Rydium**](http://www.rydiumnetwork.com/about.html) manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on our site please follow this link to go to **Rydium's Privacy Policy** section of our privacy page. 

Visitors to Neoseeker are not subject to involuntary information disclosure of any nature, other than those intrinsic to the operation of the site and the World Wide Web in general. Certain operations and features on Neoseeker may require the use of cookies and/or the propagation of session information. These cookies and sessions facilitate the visitor's experience at Neoseeker, but do not represent any other security or privacy concern outside of isolated, per visit session identification and/or recurring sessions for the purpose of storing and maintaining user submitted site preferences. 

Neoseeker does not collect private information from its users without their knowledge. Generally, users who come to Neoseeker are not required to disclose personal or private information. However, some special services such as forums and user content may require registration in order to allow full access to features. Further, Neoseeker encourages users to provide cursory private and/or personal information to build the community aspect of the site, and to obtain basic group demographics data for statistical analysis. Neoseeker does NOT sell, lease or rent to third parties, any private information linkable to a particular user and gathered through the registration process, without express consent from its users as indicated through information forms that users voluntarily fill out. 

From time to time, Neoseeker will offer incentives to users in the form of contests, prizes, and giveaways, and request that users fill out surveys or questionnaires to qualify for participation in these special promotions. Unless explicitly indicated, information from these surveys, and questionaires are used in group demographics studies and for better audience targetting - no direct relationship between demographic data and individual users is ever available to third parties. 

Neoseeker will take reasonable precautionary measures to protect and safeguard all information gathered from its users. Neoseeker does not, however, take any responsibility for any breach of security, accidental disclosure, theft, or tampering of its users' information. 

**Privacy for Children - As per COPA**

Although Neoseeker is generally targetted to an adult audience, we welcome the visitation and participation of young users, with their parents' consent. It is strongly recommended that users under the age of 13 refrain from disclosing any personal and/or private information either through the user registration system, or through participation in questionnaires and surveys, and instead opt to remain anonymous in their participation of site activities.

Please note that as of April 21st, 2000, the Child Online Protection Act of 1998 prohibits Neoseeker from the collection of private information from users under the age of 13 without parental consent. Users under the age of 13 must provide a signed letter from their parents to indicate that they are aware of their child's activities on Neoseeker and consent to these activities. This letter must be mailed or faxed to  Neo Era Media, Inc using the contact information below, before they can participate in activities requesting the disclosure of private information. 

Parents of our younger users may at any time, revoke their consent, and may request to review and edit the private information disclosed by sending a written request to Neo Era Media,Inc. via fax or mail. 

Though Neoseeker will take reasonable measures to ensure that users under the age of 13 do not disclose their private information without first obtaining parental consent, the site cannot guarantee the protection of young users who choose not to disclose their age and who do not follow the requirements set forth by COPA.

**Rydium Privacy Policy**

> **Web User Privacy Statement**
> 
> * * *
> 
> Rydium strongly believes in a consumer's right to privacy. All web user data collected by Rydium as part of the ad serving process is not personally identifiable (browser type, for example) and is used in aggregate form. Rydium does not conduct individual web user "profiling".
> 
>  **Cookies**  
>  Remote "cookies" on web user computers and server databases at Rydium facilities are used to store information by Rydium. A cookie is a piece of data placed on the Web User's hard drive by our servers. Cookies are used to improve the experience web users have when they see web advertisements. Cookies are not viruses and cannot erase your hard drive or otherwise damage your computer. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information.  
> Cookies are used to ensure that when a web user clicks on an ad, they are sent to the correct click-through destination. They are also used by our reporting system to estimate the total reach of an ad campaign, as well as frequency of display. This allows advertisers to determine with greater accuracy the composition of the audience they reach. Cookies are also used to sequence the delivery of a series of ads to a web browser, and to limit the number of times a web browser receives any one advertisement.Web Users have the option of blocking the use of cookies by changing a setting in their browser. Please see your browser supplier's website for details on how to do this.
> 
>  **Information Collection and Use**  
>  As with all web content delivery systems, Rydium records information about the interaction between a web user's browser and our servers. Those interactions include ad content (banner) delivery, counting click-throughs on an ad, and tracking webpage views after a click-through. Browsers typically provide the browser version, the oper ating system, and the IP address of the computer in use. This non-personally identifiable information is collected from web users to assist in the proper function of our service as well as the targeting of advertisements from our customers and the reporting of aggregate data to both advertisers and publishers. Rydium does not collect, use, sell, or purchase web user information that is personally identifiable.
> 
>  **Information Sharing**  
>  Web user information (all of which is non-personally identifiable) is shared with our advertisers and publishers in aggregate fashion. This means, for example, that of the millions of web users we deliver banners to each month, an advertiser will know what percentage of those users viewed their advertisement with a certain browser. The sharing of this information is essential to providing the services we offer. Rydium may augment web user information with additional non-personally identifiable information, such as an IP address to 5-digit postal code cross reference to aid in local targeting of advertising. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information by Rydium.
