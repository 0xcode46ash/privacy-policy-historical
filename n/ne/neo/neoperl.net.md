Privacy Policy
We are delighted that you are interested in our company and our products and would
like you to feel that your personal data is safely protected when visiting our website.
The protection of your privacy is very important to us. Please find below detailed
information about how your data is treated.
The collection, processing and use of personal data
You can visit our website without providing any details as to your person. We only
store access data without any reference to your person such as e.g. the pages which
you visit on our website, the date and duration of your visit or the website from which
you visit us. This information is analyzed solely for technical purposes in connection
with the administration of our website and in order to improve our offering and does
not allow us to make any inferences about your person.
Personal data such as, for example, your name, your address, telephone number or
e-mail address are only collected if you advise us of them voluntarily, e.g. by
completing contact forms, in connection with a registration or to carry out a contract.
We use the information provided by you without your separate approval only in order
to meet your wishes and satisfy your enquiries, i.e. usually to answer your query or to
process a contract that may have been concluded with you. Only if you have given us
your prior consent or if - to the extent statute so provides - you have not filed any
objection will we additionally use said information in order to be able to inform you
about our products and services and, as the case may be, to ask you about our
products and services.
Your personal data will not be passed on, sold or otherwise transmitted to third
parties unless this is necessary in order to answer your query or to process a
contract concluded with you or unless you have consented to it being passed on.
The use of cookies
So-called "cookies" can be used on our website in order to make visiting our website
attractive and so as to allow certain functions to be used. These are small text files
that are deposited in the memory of your internet browser. Cookies do not cause any
damage on your computer and do not contain any viruses. The cookies we use are
deleted from your hard disk at the end of the browser sitting. You can deactivate the
use of cookies at any time via your browser's settings.

Changes
If we wish to use your personal data in a manner that deviates from the intended use
notified at the time the data was collected we shall inform you of said change in
advance. We shall try to contact you about this via the last e-mail address known to
us. You can then decide whether you agree to the changed intended use. In the
event of any changes to our privacy policy, which do not affect the data already
stored on our database, we shall draw your attention to said changes via a
particularly emphasized notice on our website.
Right to Information
Under the statutory provisions on data protection you have the right to be informed
free of charge about your personal data stored on our database and, as the case
may be, a right to have said data corrected, blocked or deleted.
