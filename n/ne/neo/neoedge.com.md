Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies and web bug technologies on our site to measure advertising effectiveness. We have no access to or control over these technologies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by the NeoEdge service only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. You should be aware that different rules might apply to the collection, use or disclosure of your information by third parties in connection with their advertisements, promotions and other websites you encounter on the Internet. The use of such technology by these third parties is within their control and not ours. Even if we have a relationship with the third party, we do not control those sites or their policies and practices regarding your information. **This Privacy Statement does not cover any use of Personal Information that an Advertiser or ad server may collect from you.** We encourage you to investigate and ask questions directly of them in this regard. 

**Privacy of Your Postings:** We respect the privacy of the contents of users' e-mail and any postings on our websites. However, we reserve the right to monitor, edit, and disclose your use of the Service, information pertaining to any e-mail or posting or its contents to a third party if we believe such action is required by law or is necessary to protect and defend our rights, to enforce this Privacy Statement or our Agreement, or to protect the interests of our users, affiliates, advertisers, suppliers, service providers and others. 

**Disclosure to Third Parties:** We do not sell, rent, lease or disclose your Personal Information to unaffiliated entities or entities that are not our advertisers for promotional purposes, except in the limited circumstances listed below. When we plan to disclose your Personal Information to advertisers, we ask you to opt-in to do so, in which case their use of your information is subject to the advertisers' own privacy policies. The Service also offers co-branded services and features, which are events and/or promotions that we put together with another company ("Co-Branded Partner"). We will share your Personal Information with our Co-Branded Partner and your voluntary use of or participation in a co-branded promotion, service, feature or function, means that you opt-in and have given your affirmative consent to both NeoEdge Networks and our Co-Branded Partner to collect and use your Personal Information. If you wish to opt-out of a Co-Branded Partner's future use of your Personal Information, you will need to contact the Co-Branded Partner directly. 

We also have the right to disclose your Personal Information to third parties for the purpose of administering and maintaining NeoEdge Networks services, features, functions and operations. We will refer to these third parties as "

 _service providers_

" and we use service providers to efficiently provide the full range of content and the services, features and functions we bring you and we request that our service providers also protect your privacy and not disclose your Personal Information to third party marketers that are not associated with the NeoEdge Networks. Additionally, such service providers are not permitted to use your Personal Information for their own marketing or promotional purposes. 

We will make your Personal Information available to non-affiliated third parties in the following limited circumstances: 

  * When we are compelled to do so by a governmental agency, court or other entity (e.g., to respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process); 
  * If we believe your actions violate any law, regulation, our Agreement, this Privacy Statement, or any of our other terms and conditions, Rules, offerings or any other services, features or functions of the Service, or if you threaten the rights, property or safety of other users of the Service, NeoEdge Networks, its affiliates, or any of its or their service providers, suppliers, advertisers, customers, users, registered users or any other party; 
  * If, in our sole discretion, we believe such disclosure to be necessary or appropriate to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, to protect our business and assets, to defend our interests and/or to comply with our legal and regulatory obligations; or 
  * In the event of a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, transfer of control, joint venture or other business combination involving us, or our affiliates. 



**Security & Protection of Personal Information:** Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States, Canada and elsewhere. We maintain reasonable standards of security and confidentiality. However, as with most Internet sites, it is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications over an unsecured transmission. We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

We also limit access to the Service by our own employees to those individuals who are authorized for the proper handling of such information and any employee found violating our standards of security and confidentiality will be subject to our disciplinary processes. We request that our service providers follow the same policy. 

We reserve the right to deny access, use and registration privileges to any user, including, without limitation, a registered user of any services, features or functions of the Service, if we believe there is a question about the identity of the person trying to access any services, features or functions of the Service. If the burden or expense of providing access to your Personal Information is disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or if the legitimate rights of others would be violated, we may decide not to provide access to such information. In such cases, we will provide to you an explanation of why access cannot be provided and a contact person for further inquiries.
