# NEOHAPSIS > Privacy Policy

#### Neohapsis Privacy Policy

This purpose of this policy is to inform you of our practices related to your personally identifiable information and your use of this website, [www.neohapsis.com](http://www.neohapsis.com/).

Neohapsis provides services to businesses, and our website's purpose is to communicate with a business audience. This website is not targeted to consumers seeking products, services, or information for home or personal use. We do not seek to solicit or receive information from minors.

##### Personal information

Visitors can browse public areas of this website without disclosing personal data. Neohapsis operates this website on an "opt in" basis, that is, we collect personal information only if you volunteer it. Where we offer you the opportunity to volunteer personal information, we provide the option to transmit the information securely. If you authorize us to send you information and you later change your mind, you can change your communications preferences at any time by emailing us at webadmin.

When you volunteer personal information for particular purposes, we use it only for those purposes. We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information. We share it with third parties only if they are working on our behalf.

In addition, we will provide information to third parties if we are legally required to do so, and we reserve the right to transmit information to government authorities or use information in legal proceedings if we believe we have reason to suspect illegal activity or violation of our legal rights.

We do not include ad-server or other third-party web page content that would cause a visitor's clickstream information to be transmitted to a third party.

##### Non-personal information

Neohapsis logs basic technical data routinely automatically transmitted by your Internet browser. This may include internet protocol (IP) address, previous web page visited (referrer URL), browser type, and language. We maintain this information for security and technical purposes. In addition, we may aggregate this information for internal use, such as to analyze website traffic and usage.

##### Additional information

We have implemented policies, procedures, and technical safeguards appropriate to protect personal information from unauthorized and improper access, use, disclosure, modification, and destruction.

We may display links to websites controlled by other companies or organizations. These links are offered for information purposes. Neohapsis is not responsible for the privacy practices of the parties controlling those sites or the content or operation of their websites.

Changes to these generally applicable provisions will be noted on this page. We will not use a party's personal information for any new purpose without that party's explicit permission.
