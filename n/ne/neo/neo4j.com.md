Article 26 of the European Union’s Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personally identifiable information, regardless of the third country’s level of protection. By using this Site or the services, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by Neo Technology on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.

Neo Technology may also send registered users of the Site e-mail notifications notifying such users of any material changes to the Privacy Policy.
