**Personal Information**

To receive your Nerdist News e-mails, we require your e-mail address. Similarly, to provide you with text messaging services, we need your phone number and your provider information. So that we may provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical coordinates and telephone number. Nerdist does not collect any other personally identifiable information that you do not expressly provide. Nerdist Industries, LLC will never sell, rent or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission. Nerdist may share your personal information for the purpose of delivering our e-mail to you or as required by law.

   
**Non-Personal Information**

We may also request non-personally identifiable information, such as annual income, shopping preferences or age, also known as demographic and profile data, though this information is optional. We may use this data to improve our site and/or tailor your experience at our site, showing you or delivering you by email content that we think might be of interest to you, and displaying content according to your preferences. We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in Nerdist emails or on Nerdist.com, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

   
**Usage Information**

In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, Nerdist Industries, LLC may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers’ use of our site. This information is not personally identifiable and will only be used to find out how subscribers use our service and site. For example, this information will tell us how much time users spend on our site, from which other sites subscribers came, and to what other sites subscribers go. The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently deliver your emails.

   
**Review and Access**

Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update or modify this information.

   
**Choice/Opt-Out**

If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.

   
**Third Party Advertising**

Some of the ads appearing on our Web site may be delivered to you by our Web advertising partner or partners. Information about your visit to a partner site or sites, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal information), is used to serve ads to you. For more information about our advertising partner or partners, cookies, and how to “opt-out”, please contact us at info@nerdist.com for more information.
