# NERC - Privacy and cookies

## Privacy policy

NERC's website does not store or capture personal information, but for administration purposes merely logs the user's IP address which is automatically recognised by the web server.

## Cookies policy

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task;
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested;
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can use your web browser's settings to manage these small files yourself.

## Our use of cookies
