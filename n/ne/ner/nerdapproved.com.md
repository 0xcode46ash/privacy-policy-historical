We collect personal information like names, addresses and emails on a voluntary basis and only for functions that pertain to our content (i.e. post comments, contact forms, newsletters and contests).

When a visitor subscribes, personally identifiable information such as email addresses is collected. This information along with usage statistics is used only to improve the user experience and is not shared with third parties unless required by law.

Please refer to the [StackCommerce privacy policy](https://deals.nerdapproved.com/privacy) for information on how they handle newsletter and payment information.

Like all websites, we utilize log files and third-party providers like [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect and analyze traffic statistics using information like IP addresses, browsers,  ISPs, date of access, time spent on the site, pages accessed and links clicked. This information is not shared with anyone and does not contain any data that personally identifies the visitor. 

**Comments:**

Nerd Approved contains comments sections where readers can engage in a dialogue about our content. This service is provided through [Disqus](http://disqus.com/). For information on how your information is used, refer to the [Disqus Privacy Policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy). 

We try and actively monitor comments as much as possible, but this is no easy task and objectionable content might pop up from time to time. If alerted to a particular situation we will assess it and delete the offending comment if it is warranted.

Nerd Approved might request personal information from readers to fulfill requirements for contests. This may include shipping information, email and phone numbers.

Contests are generally handled through a [Rafflecopter](http://www.rafflecopter.com/) widget. Information is collected to identify participants, but is not used on our end for any reason other than to notify winners. When requested, we may share Rafflecopter data with the contest sponsor to verify entries.
