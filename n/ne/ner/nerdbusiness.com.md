# Privacy Policy | Nerd Business

Nerdbusiness.com is a blog by me, Derrick Schwabe. Privacy is a fundamental human right and I definitely support our right to privacy online. And so I am especially committed to ensuring the privacy of anyone visiting my blog. 

This site does collect some information about its visitors. Here's why: 

A) Website traffic   
It's nice to know how many people are visiting my blog. So I use a third party service which helps to track how many people visited. The service may use a "cookie" to collect this information upon each visit and may also collect the following information: page URL, page title, referring source, user agent, IP address, language, and screen resolution. If you prefer not to have this information collected, you may opt-out simply by visiting nerdbusiness.com with cookies disabled (you can disable cookies in your internet browser settings). This information will never be shared with anyone else for any purpose. 

B) Nerd Newsletter  
I offer a newsletter to those of you interested in receiving nerd related stuff by email. You will only receive email if you give me your permission. You can do this by subscribing with [newsletter sign-up form](http://nerdbusiness.com/blog/newsletter) which asks you to provide your name and email address. After subscribing, if you wish to opt-out of the newsletter you may do so by using the "Unsubscribe" link included in each email I send out using this service. Emails abide by ant-spam laws like CAN-SPAM and I will never share your name or email address with anyone else for any purpose. 

Feedback  
If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy please email [contact me](http://nerdbusiness.com/blog/contact). 

Respectfully,  
Derrick Schwabe
