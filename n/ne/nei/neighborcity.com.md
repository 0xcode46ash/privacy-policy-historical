## Privacy Policy

American Home Realty Network, LLC (“American”) respects the privacy of the information given us by its website visitors and registered users and recognizes the importance of protecting this information against unauthorized disclosure. To that end American has adopted the privacy policy (“Policy”) described below and will apply it to the information it gathers as detailed below. This Policy is current as you read it but may be amended from time to time to reflect changes and additions to it. Therefore visitors and registered users should check back for the most current version before relying on it for future use.

## The Information Gathered:

American gathers information about website visitors and registered users to improve the quality of its services. The data is collected in two ways: site visitor data and personal information data. 

Site visitor data is generally collected from website activity using “cookies”, “pixel tags” and “usage logs”. This information is collected on an aggregate basis on the visitor area of the website and on an individual basis from the registered user (password protected) area of the website. The site visitor data consists of (i) the number of visitors over a given period of time; (ii) the pages visited and the features used; (iii) the amount of time of each visit; and (iv) the domain name used by the connecting visitor. 

A “cookie” is a bit of electronic information transferred to the computer of each visitor and registered user to uniquely identify the browser being used. Cookies are used to secure the name, access codes, screen preferences, pages, and advertisements viewed (i.e. clicked on) of each visitor and registered user. Visitors and registered users can usually decline the receipt of these cookies by using various features of their software. However, declining the receipt of Internet cookies will likely interfere with a visitor's ability to view the website content. 

A "pixel tag" is an invisible tag placed on certain pages of our website. It is used to track a registered user’s activity on the password protected areas of our website. A pixel tag is also known as a "clear gif." 

“Usage logs” are data obtained by American’s computer servers that operate the website. With respect to each visitor and registered user, this data typically includes the existence of cookies, the internet protocol address, information about the browser program, and the information requested form the website. 

Personal information data such as name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc. is collected by the visitors and registered users completing various online forms, applications, surveys, and contact requests. Completing a new form will modify any information previously provided. 

## Usage and Gathered Information Disclosure:

American uses the site visitor data for various purposes, including: editorial corrections, visitor and registered user feedback, marketing and business promotion, statistical analysis of visitor and registered user responses, product and service development, content improvement and website layout, and usage feedback to advertisers. American uses the personal data as directed or authorized by the registered user to assist the registered user in securing the services of the selected real estate broker or agent, mortgage broker or company, title insurance company, or provider of other real estate related services.
