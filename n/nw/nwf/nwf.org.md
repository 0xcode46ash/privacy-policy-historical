## National Wildlife Federation  
Website Privacy Policy

The National Wildlife Federation recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of personal information collected from our website. Personal information includes your e-mail address, contact information, comments, and "click stream" data which tracks how you use our online services. We have adopted this organization-wide Website Privacy Policy to guide how we collect, store and use this personal information. 

  1. General Browsing Information--If you visit our site to read or download information, we may collect and store the following information about you in order to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, and to help us make our site more useful to visitors: 
    * the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account, or duke.edu if you are connecting from Duke University's domain); 
    * the date and time you access our site; 
    * the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our site; and the various pages that you visit while on our site. 
  2. Personally-Identifiable Information--We will explicitly notify you before we collect any personally-identifiable information about you (i.e. your name, email address, and contact information), and will not collect any information unless you choose to provide it to us. This information may be shared within our organization for the purposes of responding to any comments or questions you submit and/or providing follow-up information about our organization. Additionally, from time to time, we may share this information with other organizations that we believe may be of interest to you. Again, we will explicitly notify you before any of this information is collected.
  3. Publicly Sharing Your Information--NWF often receives information from website visitors who have successfully participated in our programs and/or employed our resources. In certain instances, we would like to publically share the comments and stories we receive by posting this information on our website. We will not, however, publically share ANY information we receive on our website without first receiving the express consent of the individual who submitted the information. Furthermore, we will not post information in any way that specifically identifies the sender of that information unless the sender approves it.
  4. Minors--Nowhere on our website will we collect personally identifiable information from minors without first receiving the express written consent of their parent or guardian.



National Wildlife Federation reserves the right to amend this policy at any time.
