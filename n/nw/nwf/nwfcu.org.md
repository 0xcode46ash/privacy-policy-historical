# NW Federal Credit Union | About Us

 

**Our Privacy Policy**

**Member Privacy Policy**

The protection of our members’ privacy and the safekeeping of confidential information are of utmost importance to NW Federal Credit Union. NW Federal Credit Union is committed to protecting confidential member account information.

_Accuracy of Information_

NW Federal Credit Union will take reasonable precautions to protect the accuracy and reliability of member information. However, members are responsible for updating their records when information changes. NW Federal Credit Union will respond to written requests to update information as quickly as possible. Requests for changes in member information must be made in writing and submitted with an authorized signature to protect against fraud. 

_Internal Procedures_

The credit union has established procedures for periodically training staff on the importance of member privacy and the credit union’s privacy policy. The credit union also distributes a copy of the policy to new staff members as part of new employee orientation.

Staff may access member account information only when necessary for business reasons.

NW Federal Credit Union has established appropriate security standards to protect against unauthorized access to member information.

_When Information May be Shared_

NW Federal Credit Union will only share information for legitimate business reasons, with the ultimate goal of bringing our members greater convenience, more choices, better service and financial savings. 

Personal financial information such as account balances or loan information will not be shared except:

  1. When necessary to complete a transaction. _Example_ : The member has provided proper identification and wishes to deposit money, pay a loan, transfer funds, _etc_. 
  2. When a third party is verifying the existence or condition of a member’s account in accordance with applicable law and the credit union has written permission from the member. _Example_ : A member is in the process of buying a home and must show funds available.
  3. When such disclosure is in compliance with the law, government agencies or court orders. _Example:_ The IRS has levied funds on a member’s account or the credit union has received a subpoena. 
  4. To protect secured assets or the assets of the credit union. _Example:_ If a member fails to make timely payments on loans at NW Federal, their information may be given to a third party collection agency.



Information shared with third party vendors will be limited to contact information such as members’ name and address. _Example:_ Names and addresses may be provided to certain vendors, such as insurance companies or auto sales promoters. Contact information will only be shared if the credit union has determined the following to be true:

  * These companies offer something of value to the membership.
  * These companies can mail promotional material at a saving to the credit union.
  * These companies sign a confidentiality agreement or have contracts that address privacy concerns.



Information obtained from outside sources (such as a credit bureau) will not be released by NW Federal Credit Union.

_Non-Disclosure of Information_

Members of NW Federal Credit Union can be confident that the protection of account information is the rule, not the exception. Although information collected in conjunction with a member’s account remains the property of the credit union, members may choose to ‘opt out’ of certain information sharing by the credit union. 

If a member wishes to opt out of receiving promotional materials, they should put their request in writing and send it to the Headquarters Branch of NWFCU. The request should include the member’s name, account number, and signature. Due to data processing restraints, credit union members wishing to opt out will be excluded from all promotional materials (including information that may be in their best interest and bring better convenience and money saving options). In the case of joint membership, one account owner’s request will be considered binding for the purposes of opting out, or opting back into the credit union’s promotional mailings.

_Availability of Policy_

NW Federal Credit Union is proud of our commitment to member confidentiality and will make this policy available to any member requesting it.
