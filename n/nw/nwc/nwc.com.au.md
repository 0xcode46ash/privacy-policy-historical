## Why ORC International collects information

We do this in order to provide information to our clients, government, commercial and not-for-profit organisations, that will assist them in making decisions about their products and services. Your input into these decisions is important as the more people that participate, the more our results will truly reflect the broadest possible body of opinion.

You can always identify an Interviewer from ORC International as they will always introduce themselves and provide our organisation's details.

However, while a respondent's information remains identifiable, respondents have the right to request access to, and/or correction or deletion of, any information about them held by our company.

Your details are automatically erased once a research project is completed. Please be aware that if we have already erased your details, we will not be able to access or retrieve your responses in any way.
