### Member Information We Collect

We only collect information about members we might need in order to establish and maintain accounts and services as required or allowed by law.  We may collect personal and financial information (member information) which is “non public.”  The member information we collect varies depending on which accounts and services you would want. Such information may come from the following sources:

> ****Application information****. We retain personal information we receive on any application that is given to us for membership, deposit accounts, EFT services, loans, financial planning, securities brokerage, insurance, or other credit union services.  This information includes: name, address, eMail, social security number, birth date, phone number, employment, financial status, and credit history.
> 
> ****Transactions****. When you make a transaction on your accounts (such as, ATM or debit transactions, loan advances, On-Line Banking, or conducting business by phone or at a branch), we retain the transaction information.  This includes: account number, the date, amount, location of the transaction, and other pertinent information.  Northwest Financial Resources (our investments and insurance services subsidiary) may also provide us with reports on securities or insurance transactions.
>

### **Member Information We Share**

In order to provide financial services, we may share certain information with our affiliate and third party service providers.  However, we only share information to the extent necessary to service a member’s account or offer new services.  If we share information, it is with the goal of bringing quality services, more choice, and greater convenience to our members.  Information we may have about former members is generally only shared or disclosed if necessary to enforce or administer an account or as required by law.

In order to conduct our operations, including account service or processing transactions, we need to share information with our service providers, including: data processing companies, check, ATM and other payment processing companies, payment networks, loan service providers, insurance companies, collection agencies, credit reporting agencies, financial planners, securities brokerage, and insurance companies, and financial service providers with whom we have joint marketing agreements.  These service providers act on our behalf and have agreed in writing to keep the member information we provide to them confidential.  We share the following categories of information to third party service providers depending on the specific services provided:
> 
>   * Personal information (name, address, and account number)

>   * Transaction information (dates, amounts, locations, and type of transaction)

> ****Sharing information as legally required or permitted****. We may share your member information in response to a lawful request issued by a court, government agency, or regulatory authority or as permitted by law in order to administer or enforce your account.  We may also share our experience information about you with credit bureaus.  Our reporting to credit bureaus is governed by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which affords you the right to make sure that your credit bureau reports are accurate.

### ****Our Confidentiality and Security Safeguards****

We have strict policies and security controls to assure that member information in our computer systems and files is protected.  Our employees are permitted access to member information that they may need to perform their jobs and to provide service to you.  Our employees have access to such member information as necessary to conduct a transaction or respond to your inquiries.  All employees are trained to respect member privacy.  No one except our employees has regular access to the credit union computer system and records storage.  The Credit Union has established internal security controls, including physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect the information you provide us and the information we collect about you.  We will continue to review our internal security controls to safeguard your member information as we employ new technology in the future.
