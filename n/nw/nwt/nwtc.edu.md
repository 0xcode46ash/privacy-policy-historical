### FERPA – Federal Government 

Access to a Northeast Wisconsin Technical College student’s educational record is governed by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA) and in conjunction with the Wisconsin Technical College System and Wisconsin Statutes. 

FERPA is a law which protects the educational records of students. A student’s official educational records are all paper and electronic records kept about the student which relate to being a student. Under FERPA, students have the right to access or deny access to their records. In compliance with these laws, the College annually notifies students of their rights regarding student information. 

A student’s official education record is confidential and shall not be released to anyone except the student (Under FERPA, parents are third parties, with no rights to the record.) Except under the following conditions: 

  * A Release of Student Records form duly signed by the student or a parent/legal guardian, is received and on file with the Northeast Wisconsin Technical College Student Records Department.  This form can be obtained at any NWTC campus or regional center in the registration office.
  * A request for specific information is received from a court or in compliance with judicial order pursuant to any lawfully issued subpoena.  Only the specific information will be provided. 
  * Request from NWTC Technical College faculty and staff with a legitimate need to know. 
  * Request from representatives of agencies or organizations from which the student is receiving financial aid. 
  * Request from officials of other postsecondary educational institutions to which the student has applied for admission. 
  * Under FERPA, as long as the student fits the category of "seeks or intends to enroll" at another institution (34 CFR Part 99.31(a)(4) and 99.34), you can provide any information you want from the education records to that next college. There's no difference under FERPA whether the information is the current ongoing progress or a final semester grade. If your college includes in its notice of FERPA rights that it will provide records to a succeeding school, you don't have to check with the student before forwarding the records. 
  * Request from other persons or agencies specifically exempted from the prior consent requirement by the Act. This includes certain federal and state officials of the District accrediting agencies, etc. 



#### Students do have the right to inspect their education records. The process to do so is:

  * Submit a written request for the inspection of identified records to the NWTC Registrar’s Office. 
  * The Registrar will contact you with a day, time and place for the inspection. 
  * The notification and inspection shall occur within 45 days from the receipt of the written request for inspection on records. 




After inspection, the student has the right to request the amendment of student education records that the student feels are inaccurate or misleading. They should write the Registrar, clearly identifying the part(s) of the record that they want changed, and specify why they feel the record(s) is inaccurate or misleading.   

If Northeast Wisconsin Technical College decides not to amend the record as requested, the College will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. 

#### For more information about FERPA, contact   
[Mark Franks](mailto:mark.franks@nwtc.edu), Registrar at (920) 498-6269 or (800) 422-NWTC, ext. 6269

### Public Records and Directory Information

However, anyone can request what is termed “directory information”. Each institution defines what they consider to be directory and non-directory information. The student also has the right to withhold any directory information that they wish from any third party by filling out a Privacy Request Form. Please consider carefully the consequences of any decision made to withhold directory information, as any future requests for such information from non-institutional persons or organizations such as prospective colleges and employers will be refused. NWTC will honor an individual’s request to withhold directory information until removed by the person, but cannot assume responsibility to contact a student for subsequent permission to release information.
