**PRIVACY STATEMENT FOR NWSOURCE**

* * *

The following statement discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for NWsource, a service of The Seattle Times Company.

**Our philosophy**  
We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. 

**Site registration and personalization**  
Site registration is required to use the personalization tools on our site: My NWsource, E-mail, Calendar, Address Book, and To-Do List. These tools are provided by InfoSpace. When you establish a NWsource account, the registration information you provide is collected and stored by InfoSpace, but we retain control of this information and its dissemination. We will never willfully disclose individually identifiable information about our customers to any third party without first receiving that customer's permission. We may allow InfoSpace to access your information for administrative purposes, such as to send you your password, if you forget it. InfoSpace may not use it in any other way. 

Your personal information is stored with cookies. A cookie is a small file that stores information about your personal preferences, either on your computer (client-side cookie) or on the web site you're visiting (server-side cookie). Your personal information, such as your account information, is stored in a server-side cookie. Your non-personal information, such as your preferences, is stored in a client-side cookie. For more information on cookies, please read our FAQ. 

Once you register with our site, any contact we may have with you will be at your request. In the near future, we plan to offer e-mail notification services which will allow you to receive e-mail from us about new content, services and products. At that time we will invite you, by e-mail, to sign up for these services. We will continue to not let third parties solicit our members. 

**Third-party providers**  
Most of the technologies on NWsource are provided by InfoSpace. Via NWsource, you may also have access to third-party products and services provided by InfoSpace's partners and affiliates. An example of a service provided by a third party is Real-Time Quotes. We do not control the information that may be collected by using these third-party services. For more information on these services, and InfoSpace's information collection practices, please read the InfoSpace privacy policy. 

**Advertising**  
We use cookies to track how many times an ad is delivered (impressions) and how many times it is clicked (click-throughs). We collect this information and share it with our advertisers, along with aggregate information about site usage and demographics. We do not share any personal information with our advertisers. 

**Public forums**  
Information that you disclose about yourself in a public chat room, message board or other public forum will immediately become available to anyone who has access to those public areas. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Links**  
This site contains links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Children's guidelines**  
This site is not intentionally targeted at children under 13. We encourage children to ask for parental consent before using or submitting any information on our site. 

**How to update/remove personal information**

For information on how to update/remove information listed in our online directories, please read our FAQ.
