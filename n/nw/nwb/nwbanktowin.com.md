# Privacy and Security | Nationwide.com

At Nationwide, protecting your privacy is crucial. We know you are interested in how we collect, use, share and protect your information. We promise to treat your personal information responsibly and provide you with choices about how we use and share it. If we change our privacy policy, we'll post the changes right here.

## Collecting, using and sharing visitor information

Many of our online activities don't require visitors to our website to register for an account or give us any personal information.

Nationwide and our business partners are still interested, however, in who visits our site and how they use it.

## Collecting and using your personal information

We require you to share your personal information with us for some of our online activities. These activities include accessing your policies online, applying for products or services and asking us questions.

Personal information is any information that identifies you and describes your relationship with Nationwide. Some examples of the information that the Nationwide family of companies may collect include:

  * Name, address and Social Security number
  * Assets and income
  * Property address and value
  * Account and policy information
  * Driver's license number
  * Financial information



  * Credit reports and other consumer report information
  * Information from applications and transactions
  * Any information you give Nationwide
  * Public information



If you apply for a product or service, we may collect information from your consumer reports, such as your credit report or motor vehicle report. We may use an "insurance score." An insurance score uses information from your credit report to help predict your future claims. Typical items that could affect an insurance score include payment history, number of revolving, new and collection accounts, bankruptcies, and foreclosures.

You may request the credit report source. Each Nationwide company has different contact information and instructions for requesting this information, so you'll want to review the specific privacy statement for the Nationwide product you own. We have included links to these products and companies under [Privacy & Security](https://web.archive.org/privacy-security.jsp "Privacy Security").

We may also need to collect your medical information. But we won't use or share your medical information for marketing, unless you give us your permission.

You may choose to correspond with Nationwide via email. Please be careful about the information you send to us in email. As with any public Web tool, email may not be secure so please do not include sensitive information.

We collect your personal information when you:

  * Ask a question
  * Use tools and calculators
  * Apply for products or services
  * Complete a form



  * Conduct transactions
  * Apply for a job
  * Send us an email
  * Subscribe to receive emails from us



## Sharing your personal information for servicing

We don't sell your information.

When you buy a product, we may share your information with other Nationwide companies or our business partners to service your product. We may also share your information with your agent, investment advisor, investment company, broker-dealer or transfer agent affiliates. They use your information to manage your policy or account.

We also share your information for everyday business purposes. Some examples include mailing your statements or processing transactions that you request. You cannot opt out of these.

## Sharing your personal information for marketing

We want our customers to have choices about how and when they do business with us. So Nationwide sells insurance, investment and banking products through many different sales channels, such as agents, the Internet or over the phone. All of these different sales channels make it easy for you to buy our products and interact with us.

Some examples of our sales channels include:

  * Nationwide agents who sell Nationwide auto, home and life insurance
  * Independent insurance agents who sell products from many different insurance carriers
  * An independent broker-dealer who sells Nationwide annuities



  * Your bank, or another affinity group that you belong to, that might offer Nationwide products
  * Your employer, who may offer a Nationwide retirement plan



Each sales channel has a specific privacy statement. These privacy statements explain how we use your information, including how we share it for marketing purposes.

For example, we have signed contracts with some of our sales channels that don't allow us to share your information to market other products to you. If you purchase a Nationwide product through one of these sales channels, such as an independent agent, we will share your information only to service your product. Because we do not share your information for marketing purposes, there is no need for you to opt out. We will tell you if this policy should change and provide you with an opportunity to opt out before we share your information.

We may share your information if our contract with the sales channel allows it. We may share it with other Nationwide companies or our business partners so they can tell you about products that might interest you. If this is the case, you will receive a “share” privacy statement with an opt-out choice. We may also have joint-marketing agreements with our business partners. This means that we may partner with them to offer you a product that might interest you. They may use your information to market their products. If you would like to learn more about opting out, please read the next section.

To learn more, review the specific privacy statement for the Nationwide product you own.

## Opt out

You can ask us not to share your information with other Nationwide companies or our business partners to market new products to you. Please remember, Nationwide offers many different types of products and services. You may not want to opt out if you would like to learn about these products directly from one of our companies. Please call us toll free at 1-866-280-1809 to opt out of this sharing.

**If you have already opted out, you don't need to opt out again.**

If you don't want your registered representative to take your information to a new broker-dealer, please call us toll free at 1-877-223-3370.

**Vermont customers  
** We won't share your information with Nationwide Companies or our business partners for marketing purposes without your consent. 

Remember, you don't have to opt out if you receive a "no share" statement because we won't share your information.

## Confidentiality and security

We use physical and technical safeguards to protect your personal information. We limit access to your personal information to those who need it to do their jobs. The law requires our business partners to use your personal information only for our purposes. They may not share it or use it in any other way. We comply with all data security laws.

## Web links

Other companies or organizations may have links to their websites on our web pages. We are not responsible for how they collect, use, disclose or secure the information that you provide to them. Please read their privacy policies so you can learn how they use your information.

## Questions

If you are a Nationwide customer, you can ask us for a copy of your personal information. Each Nationwide company has different contact information and instructions for requesting this information. You'll want to review the specific privacy statement for the Nationwide product you own for these instructions. We have included links to these products and companies under [Privacy & Security](https://web.archive.org/privacy-security.jsp "Privacy Security").
