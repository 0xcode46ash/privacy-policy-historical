NSDL Privacy Policy in Brief

The full NSDL Privacy Policy can be [seen here](http://comm.nsdl.org/download.php/179/Privacy_Draft-3.pdf).

**Introduction** The NSDL in general subscribes to the ALA Library Bill of Rights (<http://www.ala.org/work/freedom/lbr.html>). The document below describes briefly the NSDL provisions for protection of user privacy and confidentiality when using the NSDL Main Portal. 

In a library, the right to privacy is the right to open inquiry without having the subject of one's interest examined or scrutinized by others. Confidentiality exists when a library is in possession of personally identifiable information about users and keeps that information private on their behalf. 

The NSDL policies cover the NSDL Main Portal and those portals and services directly under the aegis of NSDL Library Services and Operations. Other portals and services may have their own policies, which may differ. Users are urged to be aware of the relevant policies on the portals and services they use.

**Registration**

When users register with NSDL, generally in order to have access to services using customization or personalization options, they are asked to supply a unique user name (not necessarily their full legal name), a password and an email address. The email address is used only for retrieval of lost passwords and for user account maintenance. Email addresses will not be redistributed to any third party except under court order. They will not be available internally except where necessary, nor will they be used to track usage.

**Personalization and customization**

Personalization services allow users to maintain a persistent, customized view of the NSDL as they login, and to create content with the NSDL, either for their own purposes or to share. Users will be asked to decide how much of their personal information or content can be shared when such information may be relevant or useful to other users. Users should be aware that because search engines cache such information (and the NSDL Preservation Service does as well), any information once public cannot reliably be removed from the public internet. 

Access to some information may be shared at user discretion. Internally, it will be available to limited staff for the purposes of quality control.

User created public content is potentially linkable by other users, and therefore will be maintained even if the creator is no longer a registered user. User created customization information will not be maintained if the user is no longer registered.

**Web server logs**

For quality control and security reasons, the NSDL web servers will track basic information regarding visitors to the site, and their usage. Log information on usage transactions will be aggregated for statistical purposes and the logs discarded. In addition, some users will be tracked anonymously during random sessions to glean information on user behavior of search and other services. This information will not be linked to specific users and will not be retained in any way traceable to a particular user. Internal access to information on usage at the transaction level will be limited to relevant NSDL staff only, and will not be available to third parties for any purpose. Aggregated statistics, unconnected to specific users, will be available widely. 

Logs with transaction information will be retained for a limited time and will be discarded after the relevant information is extracted. No usage transaction logs will be backed up after that period has passed. Access to information on transaction logs, prior to the routine discarding of such information, will be available to appropriate law enforcement agencies upon production of a court order.

**De-registration**

A method for purging registration information is available to authenticated users. Registration data purged via the de-registration process will not be retained by the NSDL.
