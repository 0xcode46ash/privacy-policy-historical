# US NSF - Privacy Policy

  
Privacy Policy  


Thank you for visiting the National Science Foundation web site. Please note that we collect no personal information about you when you visit our web site unless you choose to provide that information to us. **All information submitted by visitors is voluntary.**

If you are visiting the NSF home page to browse through our site, read pages, or download information, we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does **not** identify you personally. We automatically collect and store **only** the following information about your visit:

  1. The **Internet domain** (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our web site; 
  2. The type of **browser** and **operating system** used to access our site; 
  3. The **date and time** you access our site; 
  4. The **pages** you visit; and 
  5. If you linked to the National Science Foundation site from another web site, the **address of that web site**. 



We use this information to help us make our site more useful to visitors—to learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We do **not** track or record personal information about individuals and their visits. 

If you request information or services from NSF and submit personal information to facilitate response to your request, we use the information provided to respond to your message. Pressing the “submit” button indicates your consent to use the information you provide for this purpose. We will not share the information you give us with another government agency unless your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise provided by law

Subscribers to [National Science Foundation Update](http://service.govdelivery.com/service/multi_subscribe.html?code=USNSF&custom_id=823) fill out a simple form when setting up their accounts. A National Science Foundation Update account cannot be created without a valid e-mail address. However, NSF makes no attempt to identify individual subscribers or their selections. We do not create individual profiles with the information you provide or collect information for commercial marketing. 

Some NSF websites use “session cookies” to facilitate a visitor’s activity within a single session, but these cookies are not written as files to your computer’s hard drive and do not persist after you close your browser. The site does not currently make use of “persistent cookies.” If, in the future, we do start using a “persistent” cookie in order to customize your experience on the website, such a cookie will adhere to our longstanding policy—namely, the cookie will contain no personally identifiable information about you, will not be readable by servers other than [www.nsf.gov](https://web.archive.org/index.jsp), will be totally voluntary, and will be solely for your use.

For website security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, NSF employs software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage to the information on our Web sites. Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

If you have questions or concerns about NSF's privacy policy, please contact Leslie Jensen, Office of the General Counsel, phone: 703-292-5065, email: [ljensen@nsf.gov](mailto:ljensen@nsf.gov).
