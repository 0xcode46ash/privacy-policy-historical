# :: NSW Lotteries ::

This Policy sets out the approach New South Wales Lotteries Corporation (NSWLC) has adopted in its collection and management of personal information. NSWLC has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate and confirm its commitment to your Privacy.

This Policy relates to personal and sensitive information collected by any means by the Corporation.

**1\. Background**  
NSWLC markets, operates and conducts a wide range of lottery-based gaming activities. These games include Lotto, Lucky Lotteries, Powerball, Lotto Strike, Instant Scratchies, 6 From 38 Pools and Oz Lotto.

NSWLC is committed to providing the highest levels of customer and player service and respects the right of individuals to maintain their Privacy.

New Privacy laws took effect on 21 December 2001. From that date, newly acquired personal and sensitive information obtained by NSWLC or modification of personal and sensitive information already held is subject to the Privacy Act 1988 (the Act) and the National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information (NPPs). 

**2\. Aims of the Privacy Policy**  
NSWLC wants to help people understand the reasons behind, and actions taken in, the protection of personal information and will be fair and open about the process. 

The Corporation respects the individual’s right to privacy and is committed to ensuring that the collection, accuracy, storage, use, disclosure, de-identification and destruction of personal information is compliant with the Privacy Act 1988, incorporating the Privacy Amendment (Private Sector) 2000, best practice and the NPPs. 

NSWLC will ensure that its employees receive training in the proper handling of personal information. Access to information held by us will be limited to authorised people on a strict, need-to-know basis relevant to their roles and responsibilities.

**3.How and why NSWLC collects Personal Information?**  
Often times, personal information is gathered in order to improve service levels to customers. Personal information is information or an opinion, including information or an opinion forming part of a database, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can be reasonably ascertained, from the information or opinion. 

Personal information is essentially collected through the Players Club, Instant Scratchie Second Chance Draws and Prize Claims Forms for the primary purpose of administering our gaming activities and ensuring that players who win prizes obtain their winnings. The personal information NSWLC collects may include: 

• Name;   
• Address;   
• Telephone Number;   
• Ticket Number;   
• Lottery Product Played; and   
• Signature.

The Players Club Registration Form also has a number of optional fields. NSWLC does not require this information to complete our primary purpose. The optional information aids NSWLC in providing better and more satisfying services to players. If the optional information is not provided, players may not be able to realise the full benefits of membership of the Players Club.

The Players Club Registration Form, the Instant Scratchie Second Chance Draws and Prize Claims Forms include an opt-out box whereby information is not made available for publication or disclosure. If this box is ticked, details about you will not be published or disclosed.

NSWLC strives to ensure that the information collected is accurate at the time of collection and at the time of use.

**4\. Use and Disclosure of Information**   
NSWLC collects and uses information for the primary purpose of managing and promoting its lottery games. NSWLC may use information that has been collected to enable the highest possible level of service to be provided to lottery customers. This may include notifying customers of special offers, new products and other opportunities to participate in NSWLC products and services.

NSWLC will allow players and users of its services to interact with it anonymously wherever it is reasonable and practicable to do so. 

On occasions NSWLC may issue marketing materials to its Players Club Members who have previously supplied information to us. If you do not wish to receive further material, please complete the opt-out provisions on materials sent to you and return it to NSWLC addressed to the Privacy Officer or email [privacy@nswlotteries.com.au](mailto:privacy@nswlotteries.com.au). 

If you choose not to receive marketing material from NSWLC, you may miss out on special products, offers and opportunities. 

NSWLC will obtain consent for use of personal information for secondary purposes unless the use would be within that person’s reasonable expectations. NSWLC may use the information we hold for the following secondary and related purposes:

• To provide lottery-based gaming services;  
• To manage and promote those services;  
• To inform you of the ways our services to you may be improved;  
• To research and develop our services;  
• To gain an understanding of your lottery-based gaming needs in order to provide you with a better service; and   
• To maintain and develop our systems infrastructure.

NSWLC may disclose your information to: 

• Your authorised representatives (eg legal advisers) but only upon receipt of your written authorisation;   
• Unrelated third parties to enable outsourcing of relevant functions and only for the primary purpose of providing those functions;   
• Professional advisers including but not limited to accountants, auditors and legal advisers; and   
• Courts, Government and regulatory authorities as required or authorised by law.

In order to efficiently operate our lottery business it is sometimes necessary for NSWLC to obtain various services from outside suppliers. In these instances your personal information may be passed to the contractor undertaking these services. All of our contracts specify that any information passed to the contractors in the course of their duties must be protected, used, secured and disclosed in accordance with the Privacy Act and the NPPs.
