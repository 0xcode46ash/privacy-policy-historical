Third-Party Content

Nxtbook is a digital publishing technology provider (and not a publisher) of nxtbooks or other content supplied by third parties. Accordingly, we have no editorial control over such content. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers or other information or content expressed or made available by third parties, including those made in nxtbooks offered by our web site, are those of the respective author(s) or publisher(s) and not of Nxtbook. Neither Nxtbook nor any third-party provider of information guarantees the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any content. Under no circumstances will we be liable for any loss or damage caused by your reliance on information obtained through a nxtbook. It is your own personal responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any information or content available through a nxtbook.

A nxtbook may contain links to other Internet sites and third-party resources. Nxtbook does not assume any responsibility or liability for any communications or materials available at such linked sites. Nxtbook does not intend links in nxtbooks or on the Nxtbook web site to be referrals or endorsements of the linked entities; they are provided for convenience only.

Internet Protocol Addresses

Your computer uses Internet Protocol or "IP" addresses every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the web pages you request) can be sent to you. Our server automatically collects IP addresses. Nxtbook will not use your IP address to attempt to personally identify you.

Referrers

A "referrer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the web URL you linked from, and is automatically collected by our web server. This information is collected and used by Nxtbook to understand the web sites referring traffic to our web site and to present appropriate content to our potential customers. Nxtbook tabulates referrer information on an aggregate basis to identify trends and traffic patterns. 

Nxtbook may enter into agreements with content partners that require nxtbook to count the number of product downloads stemming from a referral from a content partner site. This information is collected, used and aggregated by Nxtbook to fulfill the reporting requirements of those agreements. This information may also be combined with the referrer information described above and tabulated on an aggregate basis to identify general trends and traffic patterns.

Other

Nxtbook may automatically receive and record information in our server logs or from our cookie-based tracking service from your browser, including your IP address, your computer's name, the type and version of your web browser, referrer addresses and other generally accepted tracking information. We may also record web site page views (hit counts) and other general statistical and tracking information that is aggregated with that of other users in order to understand how our web site and nxtbooks are being used.
