This Privacy Policy sets out the policies and practices of NowPublic Technologies Inc.

This Privacy Policy is part of, and incorporated into, the [Terms of Use](http://my.nowpublic.com/help/terms_and_conditions) for our Site. 

In this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information that identifies you personally, either alone or in combination with other information available to us, including without limitation your name, address, email address, telephone number, age, background, photos of yourself, or other personal information, as further defined under applicable laws.

**This Privacy Policy May Change**

We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Policy, at any time and without prior notice, by posting the revised version of this Privacy Policy on the Site. Your use of the Site following any such change constitutes your agreement that all Personal Information collected from, or about, you through the Site after the revised Privacy Policy is posted will be subject to the terms of the revised Privacy Policy.

**Collection and Use of Personal Information**

NowPublic collects the following types of information from visitors to our Site:

**Optional Voluntary Information**

In order to access or use certain services and capabilities on our Site, or to participate in certain programs, you may be required to voluntarily submit Personal Information through our Site. The use of these services or capabilities, or participation in these programs, is purely optional - you are not required to submit any Personal Information to our Site if you do not wish to use or participate. 

For example, you may wish to provide Personal Information in connection with:

  * registering to become a contributor to our Site; 
  * using our "email story" feature; 
  * participating in surveys, contests, or polls; 
  * participating in referral programs or other promotions; 
  * registering on our Site for any other reason; 
  * submitting feedback. 



Please note that if you use our Site to send content from our Site to a friend, we do not collect or store your friend's email or mobile device number, and the applicable message is considered to have been sent by you rather than NowPublic. 

**Usage Tracking**

We may track user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site, as well as use of various environments and tools offered to contributors within or through the Site. We sometimes track and catalog the search terms users of our Site enter in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand our audience. 

**Cookies and Advertising**

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it may enable us to relate your use of this Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We generally use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit the Site. 

In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These companies may use information (not including a user’s name, address, email address or telephone number) about user visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to our users. 

If you would like more information about this practice or to prevent this information being used by these companies, visit [ DoubleClick](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx), or our [online advertising networks](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp). 

NowPublic may use cookies to track user traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Site, to deliver information through your session, and to personalize the Site for you based on your preferences and selections. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. Disabling cookies may result in errors while using the Site.

In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs - which may contain visitors’ IP addresses - with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.
