We maintain this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and for tracking the success of our referral program, but will not send further unsolicited communications. 

We engage third party services such as TechTarget and KnowledgeStorm to identify potential users of our Services. These services employ their own mechanisms to enable individuals to opt out of email distribution lists.

Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites that you may access from our Web Site.

_Automated Web Site Tracking_

When you visit one of our Web Sites, statistics about your visit are automatically collected. This information does not identify you personally, but rather identifies information about a visit to the Web Site. This information may include how many people visit the Web Site, the user's Internet Protocol (IP) address, which pages are visited, from which domains our visitors come and which types of browsers these persons use. We use these statistics about your visit for aggregate, analytical purposes only, to help us improve the performance and effectiveness of our Web Site.

If you reject cookies, you may still generally access the informational material on our Web Sites, but you may be unable to obtain some of our Services or access some portions of our Web Sites. 

_Certificate Application Information_

In order to issue digital certificates and provide our Services, we must collect and maintain Personal Information about prospective Certificate Holders. Our information requirements may vary according to the type of Service being requested, as provided in the applicable service agreements, enrollment forms, and/or certificate applications. This information may include name; corporate affiliation; job title; postal address; telephone numbers; email address; gender; date of birth; dates of employment; and driver's license, passport or other government-issued identification documents numbers. We use this information to document and verify the identities or persons to whom we issue certificates or provide Services.

**INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE**

 _Aggregate Information_

We share non-identifiable aggregated demographic information about our user base with third parties, such as our marketing partners and advertisers. This information does not contain Personal Information and is not used to identify or contact individual users. 

_Personal Information_

We disclose Personal Information for the following purposes: 

_Certificate Information_

All information that you provide us that forms the content of a certificate will be "published" in a repository that can be accessed by third parties. No person should have any expectation of privacy in the contents of a certificate. 

_International Data Transfer_

We maintain and process Personal Information in the United States. Accordingly, information obtained elsewhere will be transferred to, maintained in, and processed in, and under the laws of, the United States. By subscribing to one of our Services, you must consent to such transfer and processing of your information in the United States. 

**SECURITY**

We consider the protection of all personal information we receive from our Web Site visitors, Subscribers, Relying Parties, and Certificate Holders as a core responsibility. We have security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of Personal Information. As with any transmission over the Internet, however, there is always some element of risk involved in sending personal information. In order to try to minimize this risk, we encrypt information that you submit to us electronically when submitting requests or ordering certificates. 

We implement data security safeguards based upon generally accepted industry standards to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or loss. Nonetheless, no data security techniques are 100% effective, and we cannot guarantee its security. 

**PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES**

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on our Web Site. We may change this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. If we make material revisions to this Policy that change the ways in which we use or disclose previously collected Personal Information, we will post a notice on our Web Site and, if appropriate, by email.
