# Privacy Policy

Last updated June 2, 2014 Not Doppler Pty Limited ("Not Doppler") is committed to ensuring our website (www.notdoppler.com) and any published mobile apps (under the publisher name: Not Doppler or Not Doppler Pty Limited) are fun and safe environments. Not Doppler does not actively run a user registration system, forum, chat or instant messaging function and thereby does not directly collect any personally identifiable information about our users unless they directly contact us or respond to a feedback survey and provide such information. Some games featured or hosted on Not Doppler that are managed by third-party publishers may contain features such as user registration systems, forums, chat rooms and so forth; which are not managed by Not Doppler and are dictated by the privacy policy of the game's publisher. 

Not Doppler does however collect some basic browsing related data for advertising and analytics purposes. Please consult the below privacy policy which contains further details: 

**Cookies and data collected:**  
Not Doppler collects information about the way visitors and players are using our website through the use of Google Analytics and its related cookie(s). The goal of collecting this data is to make better informed decisions about what games our users are more likely to enjoy and to help improve the experience on Not Doppler. The type of information that Google Analytics collects includes browser and operating system type, country, pages visited, time spent on site, date/time stamp and broad demographic information. Google Analytics does not collect any personally identifiable information about you on Not Doppler.

Certain games on Not Doppler will create "Local shared objects" which allow the game to save game progress so that when you return you can pick up from where you left off. Any game save data is stored only on your computer and not transferred to Not Doppler or any other third party. Some games from third-party publishers that are included on Not Doppler may offer the ability to save game-progress in the cloud via third-party servers, in which the storage and retrieval of such data is dictated by the privacy policy of such game publisher offering the service.

Please see Advertising section below for further details on cookies. 

**External Links:**  
Not Doppler may link to other web sites and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of these external sites. Some games on Not Doppler also contain links to external sites or may contain requests for personal information for gameplay purposes (e.g. account registration or chatroom features) which are governed by their own individual privacy policies. All users should therefore also be aware of the individual privacy policies within any game that requests personal information such as name or email address.  **Advertising:**  
Not Doppler is a free to use website and generates revenue through third-party advertising on the website. Without the support of this advertising Not Doppler would not be able to provide new games every Thursday. These third-party advertising companies may collect and use information about your visits to this and other websites to help determine which advertisements are most suited to your interests and measure performance of any advertising campaigns. In order to collect this information, the third-party may use a cookie or other such as javascript codes. Not Doppler has no influence over the policies of third-party advertising networks (except our ability to discontinue using their services).
