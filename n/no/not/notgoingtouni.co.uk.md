#### Why we collect your data?

By collecting your data, it allows us to understand what your needs and wants are, provide personalised content and match the most relevant adverts and services for you. It also allows us to provide targeted offers and services you may be interested to hear about.

#### Data Protection Principles

Not going to uni Limited complies with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003. The eight principles relating to the processing of personal information are:

  * Fairly and lawfully processed
  * Processed for a limited time
  * Adequate, relevant & not excessive
  * Accurate
  * Not kept longer than necessary
  * Processed in accordance with your rights
  * Secure
  * Not transferred to countries without adequate protection



Your privacy and security is of utmost importance to us. We will always follow these principles and ask you how you would like us (or our partners) to communicate with you. The Information Commissioner regulates compliance with the Data Protection Act.

#### Marketing consent

By returning or submitting a form with your personal information to us or your continued use of our services, you consent to:

a) our processing your personal data for the above purposes; and

b) the transfer and processing of your information in countries outside of the European Economic Area which may not provide the same level of data protection as the UK. If we do make such a transfer or if your personal information will be processed outside of the European Economic Area, we will put a contract in place to ensure your information is protected or where applicable covered by the US "Safe Harbor Program".

#### Marketing consent

If you are an existing customer we will keep you informed of product developments that relate to these products and services.

When you give us your personal information, we will give you an option to receive additional ongoing marketing communications from us which may include offers and news of alternative products and services.

We do not sell our customer data to other companies to use for their marketing purposes outside of notgoingtouni.

All of our marketing communications will have a method to unsubscribe.

Please note: Many products or services include personalised communications as part of their package; users will be given the opportunity to control the receipt wherever possible. In the event that the product or service consists entirely of communication (e.g editorial bulletins) this may take the form of unsubscribing from the specific communication.

If you purchase or redeem an offer with us, we may need to disclose your personal information to our partners, suppliers and subcontractors in order to process your order, fulfil deliveries, complete billing and invoicing transactions and to inform delivery and logistics planning.

We may supply personal data to trusted suppliers for analysis purposes. This will be done under agreement with us and will be in line with this policy.

We will work with other companies for promotional purposes where readers may be asked to opt in for future contact from that specific partner. With your permission we will transfer that customer data to the third party at which point it will fall under their own privacy and security controls. Not going to uni Ltd cannot be held liable for subsequent issues arising from third party usage of transferred data.

#### Disclosure

Your personal information will be disclosed where we are obliged or permitted by law to do so. If you post or send offensive or objectionable content anywhere on or to any of our websites or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on any of our websites, we can use the information that is available to us about you to stop such behaviour.
