## Return Policy

What if I receive my product and it does not work?

Please call our Customer Care Department at 1-800-999-3756 to receive parts and service if needed. If you receive a machine that is damaged beyond repair we will be happy to send a replacement machine or give a full refund.

If the freight company does not allow you to refuse the shipment please call us while they are still at your home.

What is the return policy

We give a 30-day trial period on all products. If you are not satisfied for any reason please call 1-866-896-9777 to set up a return. If you were not charged for shipping on your initial delivery you will only be charged for the return shipping. A 10% restocking fee is also charged on all returned merchandise (unless the merchandise is defective). Returns must be arranged within 30 days of receiving the product. You must receive a Return Authorization number from us in order to return the product. The following information is required to obtain a Return Authorization: 

a. Model number

b. Serial number

c. Accurate reason for the return

Products being returned must be disassembled and packaged in the original box or comparable package. If you do not have a box, we can provide one for you. 

Icon is not responsible for the disassembly of the product.

Once the product is packaged, take it to your curb and we will send a freight carrier to pick up your machine and upon receipt at our warehouse we will refund the purchase price (price of machine plus tax) less the restocking and return freight fees. All products must be returned in good condition and with all paperwork, parts and accessories or an additional 10% charge may be added. You can expect a refund in the same form of payment originally used for the purchase within 30 days of our receiving your returned product. Once a Return Authorization number is issued, the product must be returned within 30 days of the issuing date or the Return Authorization number will become invalid. If we are doing an exchange of your product, the unit being returned must be received back to Icon within 30 days from the delivery date of the new machine or you agree to pay Icon the full retail cost of the machine.

What if I want to cancel my order after it has shipped?

We will refund the purchase price (price of the machine and tax) less to and from shipping charges. If you were not charged for shipping on your initial delivery you will only be charged for the return shipping fee. A 10% restocking fee is also charged on all returned merchandise.
