This Privacy Policy explains how NoRedInk collects and uses information from its users who access the Website and use our services, including NoRedInk's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers NoRedInk's treatment of any Personal Information that NoRedInk's business partners share with NoRedInk, or that you provide to NoRedInk through a third party website. **This policy does not apply to websites or practices of companies that NoRedInk does not own or control, or to individuals that NoRedInk does not employ or manage, including providers of third party software that may be offered on NoRedInk's Website ("Third Party Software").**

HOW IS CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION TREATED?

**

If you are a minor (under the age of 18), you may only use this service and disclose Personal Information with your parent or guardian's express consent. NoRedInk collects limited Personal Information from students ("Children's Personal Information"), but only where that student's school, district, and/or teacher has contracted with NoRedInk to collect Children's Personal Information from students for the use and benefit of the learning environment. NoRedInk requires schools, districts, and/or teachers to obtain parental consent from students' parents before collecting any such Children's Personal Information. If you are a student, please do not send any Children's Personal Information about yourself to us, other than what we request from you when you sign up for the Services. In the event that we learn that we have collected Children's Personal Information from a student without parental consent being obtained by his or her school, district, and/or teacher, or if we learn a student has provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what we request when he or she signs up for the Website, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a student may have provided us Children's Personal Information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Website, or that a student's school, district, or teacher has not obtained parental consent, please contact us at [info@noredink.com](mailto:info@noredink.com). 

Hereinafter, references to "Personal Information" shall apply to personal information of individual Website users who are not student registrants. References to "Children's Personal Information" shall only apply to personal information of student users of the Website. General references to "information" shall apply to all users.

WHAT INFORMATION DOES NOREDINK DISPLAY OR COLLECT?

**

When you use the Website, you may set up your personal profile and interests, send messages, perform searches and queries, and transmit information through various channels, depending on the category of user ("User Category") you are, and as permitted by the functionality of the Website. The information we gather from users enables us to personalize and improve our services. In most cases, we retain such information so that, for instance, you can return to view prior messages you have sent or easily see your connections list. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time to enable reversion to the prior version of that information. In addition to the foregoing, we collect the following types of information from our users.

 **

You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our features. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain information, products and services, customizing the content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new features. The Children's Personal Information you provide shall only be used for creating your individual account (which will identify you within the user group(s) for which you have been granted an access code ("Limited-access User Group")), and for sending you Notifications.

Information Collected Automatically:

**

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with the Website or our services. NoRedInk automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, NoRedInk cookie information, and the page you requested. We also record the details of your activity on the Website. This information is not Personal Information or Children's Personal Information.

Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. NoRedInk only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Website or services so that we can make the Website appealing to as many users as possible and improve those services. As part of this use of information, we may provide aggregate information to our partners about how our users, collectively, use our site. We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use our partners' services and the Website to help provide you with an optimal online experience.

 **Email Communications:**

If you provide us your email address, we may send you email communications. If you are a student, we will only use your email address to send you Notifications. If you are not a student, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from NoRedInk if your computer supports this type of program. NoRedInk uses this confirmation to help us make emails more interesting and helpful. We also compare our non-student user list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our users.

 **

WHAT ABOUT COOKIES?

**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. NoRedInk cookies do not collect Personal Information or Children's Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information or Children's Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or email address is.
