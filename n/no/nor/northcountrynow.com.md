**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing a classified ad only to complete that order and charge for the ad. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order.

We use the information you provide when requesting advertising information or submitting news items, photos, links and comment only to confirm the identity of the submitter. We do not share this information with outside parties.
