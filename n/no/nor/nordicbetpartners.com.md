* ## What cookies are and what we use them for

Like most websites we use cookies to a limited extent to enhance the user experience and provide customisation and useful features to our website and products. We also use standard analytics software to allow us to see how our users are interacting with the site in aggregate.

Since we are able to collect this data on you, we want to be as clear as possible about how we collect the data, what we collect and most importantly, what we do with it. The aim is to provide you the user, with as much transparency and control as possible.  
What we should make clear from the start is that we DO NOT sell the information collected by cookies, nor do we pass the information on to anyone else!

So what are ‘cookies’? Well, a ‘cookie’ is a small piece of information stored on your web-browser (Explorer, Firefox, Safari) which allows your web-browser to remember specific information about a website or webpage.

This ‘cookie’ provides us with useful information related to visitors to our website such as, if you’re a unique visitor or if you have been to our website before. The time you spent visiting our website and which particular page you spent the longest time on, allowing us to calculate the average length of time users spend on our website. Also, how did you find your way to our website, via a search engine or from a direct link.

With this information, we can see where our website is working and where it is not. An example could be that we have very few unique (new) visits from customers but we do see that those who have visited us before, do so again. 

## When we ask for your data it's to give you something back

Knowing something more about you, our customer, helps us give you more of what you want. More exclusive offers, more of what you like, more information and more control…

What's the pick of our bonuses and offers? What's the right offer that YOU want? Our weekly newsletters will keep you posted.

## We are clear on what data we hold and what we do (or don't do) with it

We work continuously to develop clear, easy-to-read and easy-to-understand terms and conditions and promotions.

We use information on how users use our websites and applications to understand how we can improve them and the content they hold. By understanding which promotions, products and offers you like, we can recommend others that you might also like. We will also use this knowledge to create more promotions and offers big and small that we think you'll love. 

## You control the data we have

We recognize that personal information is valuable and needs to be treated with care. As we mentioned previously, we will NEVER sell it to anyone and we won't clutter your email with stuff you don't want.

If you don't want to continue to receive relevant targeted advertising via our website and via newsletters after you have closed your account, we recommend that you also delete any cookies set on your web browser. 

## What if my cookies are blocked – Unblock them!

With cookies disabled, the website will restrict and disallow you from maximising your product experience and in some cases may disallow you from taking part completely. For example, with cookies blocked the website will forget your login information producing an inconvenient user experience requiring that you enter the same information multiple times. Such situations indicate that you may have overdone cookie blocking and certain cookies may need to be unblocked.

Unblocking cookies from your web browser will allow you to fully realise the brand experience including the latest casino games, poker tournaments, website promotions and the best offers customised just for you.

If you wish to unblock the cookies on our site, or any other website, this can be done through your web browser settings. You may wish to visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) which contains information on how to do this on a wide variety of web browsers
