# Consumer Privacy Principles

Consumer Privacy Principles

Northern Trust Corporation ("Northern Trust", "we", "us", or "our") and its subsidiaries recognize and respect the privacy expectations of our customers. In that spirit, we provide the following principles of consumer customer privacy: 

Use, Collection and Retention of Customer Information   
We support the principle that financial institutions should collect, retain and use information about individual customers only in situations that the institution believes it would be useful (and allowed by law) in administering that person's business and in providing products, services and other opportunities to its customers. 

Maintenance of Accurate Information   
We have established procedures to further the goal that our customer's financial information be accurate, current and complete in accordance with reasonable commercial standards. We strive to respond to requests to correct inaccurate information in a timely manner. 

Limiting Employee Access to Information   
We seek to limit employee access to personally identifiable information to those with a business reason for knowing such information. Northern Trust believes in educating employees so that they will understand the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy and believes in taking appropriate measures to enforce employee privacy responsibilities. 

Protection of Information via Established Security Procedures   
We maintain appropriate security standards and procedures regarding unauthorized access to customer information. 

Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information   
It is Northern Trust's policy not to reveal specific information about customer accounts or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except for the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies to maximize the accuracy and security of such information or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence or business matter; unless 1) the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 2) the customer requests or permits it; 3) the disclosure is required by or allowed by law (e.g., subpoena, investigation of fraudulent activity, request by regulator, etc.); or 4) the customer has been informed about the possibility of disclosure for marketing or similar purposes through a prior communication and given the opportunity to decline (i.e., "opt out"). 

Maintaining Customer Privacy in Business Relationships with Third Parties   
In the limited circumstances that we provide personally identifiable customer information to a third party, we expect that the third party will adhere to similar privacy principles that provide for keeping such information confidential. 

Protection of Information Online   
We subscribe to the same privacy principles that protect personally identifiable customer information on the Internet. Our online security procedures include the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts (or scrambles) the information transmitted as it travels through the Internet, and decrypts the information after a secure connection has been made with our Internet server. For a complete description of our online security procedures visit [www.northerntrust.com/passport/security.html](https://web.archive.org/personal/onlineservices/private/security.html). To provide better services to our customers and more effective web sites, we gather and analyze online data, including number of hits, number of page visits, length of user sessions, etc. Additionally, we use and analyze "cookies," small pieces of information stored by a web site on users' browsers that can only be read by the web site that set them. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and Northern Trust does not combine data collected through cookies with other customer information.
