# Privacy Policy

#### NORML's Privacy Statement

NORML understands your concerns about your privacy, both on and off the Internet. We have provided this privacy statement so that you will know what information NORML gathers, how we use that information, and what you can do to correct it if necessary.

#### What information NORML gathers about you

 **Web Traffic Monitoring**  
NORML keeps track of **non-personally identifiable information** such as the [IP address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) of the user's computer, time of access, browser type and files downloaded to gather usage statistics for its web site. IP addresses are not associated with other information about a user, but only indicate general visitor navigation patterns. This is typically done by most websites.

Additionally, though NORML is primarily funded by individual donors, in order for NORML to successfully meet its organizational goals through other fund raising sources the NORML's website has embedded tags that allow some third party entities such as [Quantcast](http://www.quantcast.com/docs/display/legal/Privacy+Policy) and [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect **non-personally identifiable** usage statistics.

NORML does not collect personal information through our website other than what is supplied to us on a voluntary basis.

 **Cookies**  
NORML's web site does not use cookies, except for the case of periodic pop-up windows relating to NORML messages and legislative alerts.

You may ask to stop receiving future mailings as [described below](http://norml.org/privacy-policy#unsubscribe). Telephone numbers, if provided, are used to contact the buyer in case of problems with a purchase and may in the future be used to solicit contributions.
