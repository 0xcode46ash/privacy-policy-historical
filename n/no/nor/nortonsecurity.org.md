You also acknowledge and agree that the data can be combined and/or refined and/or used in any other matter with data from any of the websites owned and/or operated, in whole or in part, by NortonSecurity.org.

Please be advised that NortonSecurity.org advertisers or websites that have links on the Site may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those websites linked to the Site are not covered by this Policy.

The Site will not disclose your personally identifiable information except as described below:

Some of our employees and contractors are subject to non-disclosure agreements with us.

These and other legal restrictions may prohibit their use of the information you provide us for any purpose except to facilitate the specific Site-related operation, unless you explicitly agreed or gave your prior permission to them for additional uses.

If you complete a transaction with an advertiser linked to the Site, the information obtained during your visit to that advertiser, and the information you give, may be provided to the advertiser. Advertisers linked to the Site have separate policy practices for which NortonSecurity.org has no responsibility or liability.

We may disclose account information where we have reason to believe that disclosing the information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating NortonSecurity.org's policies as specified in the Privacy Policy or relevant Terms of Use, may be violating state or federal law, or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) NortonSecurity.org's rights or property, other users of the Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. NortonSecurity.org may disclose or access account information when we believe that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain and improve our services.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they unlawfully collect from the Site. We will try to protect your privacy, however, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

**  
What are my choices regarding collection, use, and distribution of my information?**  
We may contact you if you use the services provided by the Site or if you contact us directly by direct mail or email. We will also contact you regarding any problems with your account and for website misuse.

**  
How may I use other users' information?**  
Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply with all applicable local laws and rules regarding online conduct and privacy, as well as content. Specifically, but not as a limitation, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding transmission of technical and personal data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside.

**  
What security precautions are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of my information?**  
Whenever the Site handles your personal information, we take steps to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with the relevant Terms of Use and this Policy. Your information is stored on our servers located in the United States. We use procedural and mechanical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. We cannot, therefore, warrant or ensure the security if any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.

If you choose to share your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy.

NortonSecurity.org reserves the right to transfer any and all information that we collect from visitors, or that we otherwise collect concerning or in connection with the Site, to a third party in the event of a sale or other transfer of assets or of any portion of our business.
