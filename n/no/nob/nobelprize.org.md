## How we collect your personal information 

Some of the services at Nobelprize.org, such as certain educational games and interactive services, require registration. To use these services, we may ask you for personal information and an account password.

Other services (such as the options to evaluate and rate our content) may give you the option of providing personal or demographic information, such as your e-mail address, name, address, ZIP or postcode, age, gender, preferences or favourites. You can decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Nobelprize.org may not be able to fully provide those services to you.
