Nolo is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.nolo.com](http://www.nolo.com/). When you visit a Web site displaying the [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/) trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. This Web site has agreed to participate in TRUSTe's formal resolution process. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us by e-mail at [privacy@nolo.com](mailto:privacy@nolo.com). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe by clicking [here](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php).

The TRUSTe program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from this site.

### Security

We work with LMi.net E-Commerce Solutions to make our site as secure as possible, helping you avoid e-fraud while using a top-of-the-line shopping cart system.

To protect the security of the information you give us when you order online, Nolo uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your information so that no one other than Nolo will be able to decode it. SSL establishes a secure connection between your computer and our computers, and that connection remains secure until you complete or cancel an order.

How will you know that your connection is secure? Simply check the lower right corner of your browser after placing a Nolo product in your shopping cart. If you see a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending on what browser you are using), your connection is secure and your information is safe.

### The Use of Cookies

Nolo's website places a session cookie on your computer. A cookie is a unique identifier that helps us understand how visitors navigate the site. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major websites employ them. Most browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept the cookie.

The cookie itself does not identify you, your email address or any other personal information. We use the information it provides to help us improve the site and our service, and to provide our visitors with a better experience while on the site. These cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information. Even without accepting a cookie you can still access most of the features on the site. There will, however, be limitations on your use of some site functions. For example, if you choose to disable cookies you will not be able to take advantage of promotional discounts in our outbound emails. In order for the links in our newsletters to work, the subsequent landing page we create for the promotion and in order have you receive the appropriate discount, your cookies will need to be enabled. The email itself does not contain a cookie, the landing page you come to via the email will use a cookie to apply the appropriate discount. There is no personal or aggregate data collected by these cookies. The cookies are used to track the flow of traffic through the site and to maintain a list of products that have been added to the shopping cart.

### Log Files

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamp.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

### Nolo Now

Users who wish to create an online will using Nolo Now will be asked to provide information in order to create an account. Once you start your will, we'll keep your data for 90 days so that you can come back, make changes, and complete your document. If you purchase the will, we'll keep your data for a year.

You may also delete your entire account via the account management page.

Payment is made when a user wants to download/print their completed document. They may complete the will, but will not be able to download or print it until they purchase the will.

### Suggestion Box

The suggestion box is for customers to submit suggestions about our products. Contact info is not required, but, if any is given, it is used solely for follow-up, if necessary. No personal information submitted via the Suggestion Box is used for any other purpose.

### Communications from the Site

Nolo may contact customers via email for various reasons. The details on when and why are explained below.

**Order Confirmation Emails  
**After placing an order, a customer will receive a confirmation email with their shipping address and order details, including an order number.

**Email Newsletter Subscription Confirmation Emails**  
Anyone subscribing to one or more newsletters _for the first time_ gets a confirmation email which contains:

  * confirmation of subscription
  * names of the specific newsletters they are subscribed to
  * two links to free downloadable eProducts
  * an email address in case subscribers have questions or comments
  * instructions on how to cancel their subscriptions



Anyone _updating_ their current subscriptions or email information gets an email that:

  * confirms their changes
  * names specific newsletters they are subscribed to
  * an email address in case subscribers have questions or comments
  * instructions on how to cancel their subscriptions



In addition: Anyone who signs up for the first time for a particular newsletter, or changes a current subscription to get a new newsletter, will then receive the current edition of that newsletter within minutes of subscribing – which is mentioned in the confirmation email. The only exception is Nolo's Special Offer, which is sent out to new/current subscribers only when the next one is available.

**Email Newsletter Cancellation Confirmation Emails  
**Anyone unsubscribing from an email newsletter(s) receives an email confirmation that they are unsubscribed. This email details those email newsletters they will no longer receive, and those that they are still subscribed to. If they are no longer subscribed to any email newsletters, this is also indicated. Cancelled subscribers are also provided an opportunity to re-subscribe at any time, and an email for any questions or comments.

**Regular Email Newsletters  
**Nolo.com currently publishes four regularly delivered email newsletters:

  * NoloBriefs (delivered monthly)
  * Nolo's Special Offer (delivered monthly)
  * Nolo's BizBriefs (delivered monthly)
  * Every Landlord's Legal Quarterly (delivered every three months)



**Irregular Email Communications**  
Nolo's Legal Updater is an opt-in service that delivers emails to subscribers who want to be informed when a new edition of their current book or software is available. The information collected on this page is product title or titles desired (mandatory), first name (optional), last name (optional) and email address (mandatory). Federal, state and local laws change constantly, often annually. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consumers to know when their do-it-yourself legal books and software no longer reflects current laws. Nolo's Legal Updater provides this information, and gives consumers a chance to obtain the latest edition or version at a reduced cost.

Nolo.com will from time to time deliver email offers to customers who have opted to allow us to communicate with them, though not all are subscribers to Nolo's email newsletters or to Nolo's Legal Updater. Customers who ask to no longer receive such offers are marked as "Do Not Deliver" in our database.

Finally, if there's ever a major error included in a Nolo email that provides misleading information or misstates the nature of an offer, Nolo will send a corrected version of the email, accompanied with an explanation of the problem.

### Sharing of Information

Nolo does not share aggregate or personal information with 3rd parties who are not service providers.

### Legal Disclaimer

Nolo will disclose personal and aggregate information when required by a valid legal mechanism such as a search warrant, subpoena, or court order, or when we deem it necessary, in our sole discretion, to protect our rights and the safety of others, or our members, employees, or properties.

### Online Surveys

At times Nolo will run online surveys asking for specific contact or demographic information, such as what areas of the site interest you and how you use the web for personal use. These surveys are always optional. The purpose of these surveys is to improve the website for its users.

### Off-Site Links

Nolo provides links to other sites. Nolo is not responsible for the privacy practices or contents of these other sites.

### Framed Sites

Nolo may syndicate its content to and distribute its content through other sites on the Internet.
