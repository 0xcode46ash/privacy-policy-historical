# NOLS - Privacy Statement

The **National Outdoor Leadership School** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [National Outdoor Leadership School](http://www.nols.edu/) and associated business information systems.

Information Automatically Logged

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. The NOLS Web site also logs IP addresses for systems administration purposes and to track a user's session. This gives NOLS an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous.

Demographic and profile data are also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site.

Application Forms

NOLS application forms, both on-line and paper, require users to give us contact information (such as their name, email, and postal address), financial information (such as their bank account or credit card numbers), unique identifiers (such as their social security number), and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, education and parent or emergency contact). Information from the application is used to enroll students. The student's contact information is also used to send enrollment material and to get in touch with the student when necessary. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors to verify the user's identity, and for use as account numbers in our record system.

NOLS does not share the contact information of those requesting promotional materials or those enrolled on our courses with other organizations. NOLS does, on occasion, share the name and address of an enrolled student pre-course with another enrolled student to facilitate travel to the course location.

NOLS does on occasion share contact information of our graduates with environmental organizations that our graduates may be interested in or with strategic partners. Some examples: MBNA for offering a NOLS affinity card or Patagonia for a mailing to support NOLS scholarships. NOLS is very discrete in making these arrangements and you may opt out of having your contact information shared. See the opt-out information below.

Applicants under the age of 18 cannot apply on-line. They can fill out the information using the on-line form, but must print it out, have it signed by a parent and mail or fax it in.

Order, Address Update and Guestbook Forms

Our site uses order, address update and guestbook forms for customers to request information, products, and services or to update their contact information and provide NOLS with feedback. We collect contact information (such as their email address), financial information (such as their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (such as their zip code, age, or income level). Contact information from these forms is used to ship purchases or information about our School or to update our records. The customer's contact information is also used to send promotional material and to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers (such as social security numbers) are collected from Web site visitors for use as account numbers in our record system.
