NOGGIN.COM is a site where preschoolers and their parents can play games, make stuff and find out more about the shows on Noggin. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate preschoolers and their parents about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the web. We are committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parent or guardian before entering any information on any website and we urge parents and guardians to discuss with their preschoolers restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 

  
At Noggin.com, it is our policy to create website content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Consequently, Noggin.com generally limits its collection of information to what is known as non-personal information (e.g. an online username and password). This information is collected when users register to participate in certain online activities (e.g. creating digital works). Registered users may set up personalized portfolio pages to save and view digital works which they make on Noggin.com, and to do so we do not ask for unnecessary personal information, all we ask from users is their username and password. From time to time, however, Noggin.com may request limited personal information (e.g. an e-mail address), as explained below, in order to let users send electronic materials to family and friends, conduct online contests or sweepstakes or to get a parent or guardian's permission for Noggin.com to display and use digital works preschoolers made on Noggin.com. Noggin.com does not condition a user's participation in an activity on the preschooler's disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

* Noggin.com may provide users the opportunity to send certain electronic materials, such as electronic postcards featuring original artwork created by Noggin.com, or digital works registered users created themselves, to friends and family via e-mail. We may ask for first name, but do not require users to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send electronic materials via email. We do, however, ask users to submit the email address of the recipient of the electronic materials. These e-mail addresses are used only to send the electronic materials, are retained by our server for several hours, and then deleted from our system. 
* Preschoolers and their parents who have registered with a nickname and password can make digital works on Noggin.com and save and view them in their own personalized portfolio pages. Users who want to have Noggin.com display or use digital works created by them on-air and in other media may send a request to Noggin.com by providing us with the email address of the parent or guardian of the preschooler. We email the parent or guardian to obtain their permission to display or use their preschooler's digital work on-air and in other media. Other than within the preschooler's personalized portfolio pages on Noggin.com, which only the preschooler and their parents can view, Noggin.com will not use or display the digital works of preschoolers on-air or in other media whose parents do not respond, or who decline consent. The parent's or guardian's email address is only used for the purpose of obtaining their permission for the right to use and display the digital works as described above and is deleted from our system sometime after the email seeking permission is sent to the parent or guardian. 
* Noggin.com may offer parent's of preschoolers the opportunity to enter contests and sweepstakes. Noggin.com may ask for the parent or guardian's first name and the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. All the information collected by Noggin.com is used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected. The information collected in our contest or sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house that helps run the contest or sweepstakes, who may not use such information for any other purpose and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of any information that it receives from Noggin.com.

  
Noggin.com uses or may use personal information for contacting parents or guardians of preschoolers in connection with its website activities, such as conducting contests or sweepstakes and seeking permission from parents or guardians of preschooler's to display and use on-air and in other media the digital works made by the preschoolers and their parents or guardians on Noggin.com. Noggin.com currently does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that users provide except, from time to time however, we may transfer, disclose or share such information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities (e.g. conducting contests and sweepstakes). Such third parties have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. Additionally, in the event that all or substantially all of Noggin's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Noggin may transfer such information and information collected from parents or guardians to the acquiring entity. Finally, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to third parties when required by law or is pertinent to judicial or government investigations or proceedings, or otherwise necessary to protect our website or the safety of its users.

  
"Cookies" are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a site. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies are used to record whether a visitor has indicated that they have certain plug-in software applications installed on their browser. Cookies also allow websites to "remember" user activities on a website as well as user's visits to a site. At Noggin.com cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period and to remember non-personally identifiable user-names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated. We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that kids submit online when participating in our activities. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser.

The ads appearing on Noggin.com are delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. In the course of serving ads, the ad service provider may place or recognize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to Noggin.com, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. For more information about the third party ad service provider and how to "opt out" of the ad serving cookie, please click here.

Log data collected on web servers both within Noggin's control and under the control of Noggin's third party ad service provider, who is required to maintain such data on a confidential basis, supplies Noggin with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. Noggin uses such aggregate information to improve access to content based on visitor's browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many kids as possible. We do not link the log data collected to the personal information that kids submit online when participating in our activities. 

  
At Noggin, our goal is to help parents ensure that their preschoolers have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any personal information collected about their child and ask us to correct any factual inaccuracies, delete this information, and/or request that we refrain from further collection or use of their child's information.

Noggin.com provides a "bumper page" when linking from Noggin.com to an advertiser's site, which lets preschoolers know they are going to an advertiser's site and reminds them not to give out information online without getting permission from their parent or guardian. 

Noggin.com provides links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices. Noggin.com provides internal "bumper pages" that inform preschoolers that they have linked to another site and instructs them not to give out information online before checking with their parents. These other websites are governed by their own privacy policies or information collection practices, which may be substantially different from ours. We encourage visitors to other websites to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of those websites.
