Privacy Policy  
NOGGIN.COM is a site where preschoolers and their parents can play educational games, make stuff and find out more about the shows on Noggin. At Noggin.com, we strive to educate preschoolers and their parents about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the web. We are committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge preschoolers to check with their parent or guardian before entering any information on any website and we urge parents and guardians to discuss with their preschoolers restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 

What Information Is Collected  
At Noggin.com, it is our policy to create website content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Consequently, Noggin.com generally limits its collection of information to what is known as non-personal information (e.g. an online username, password, preschooler’s age, gender and zip code). This information is collected when parents register their preschooler for the site to participate in certain online activities (e.g. creating digital works). Registered users may set up cubby pages (i.e. personalized portfolio pages) to save and view digital works, which they make on Noggin.com, and to do so we do not require the visitor to submit unnecessary personal information, all we require from users is their username and password. From time to time Noggin.com may request limited personal information (e.g. an e-mail address), as explained below, in order to let users send electronic materials to family and friends, conduct online contests or sweepstakes or receive the Noggin.com newsletter. . Noggin.com does not condition a user's participation in an activity on the parent's disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

* Sending Electronic Materials. Noggin.com may provide users the opportunity to send certain electronic materials, such as electronic postcards featuring original artwork created by Noggin.com, or digital works registered users created themselves, to friends and family via e-mail. We may ask for a first name, but do not require users to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send electronic materials via email. We do, however, ask users to submit the email address of the recipient of the electronic materials. These e-mail addresses are used only to send the electronic materials, are retained by our server for several hours, and then deleted from our system. 
* Use of Digital Works Made by Preschoolers on Noggin.com. Preschoolers and their parents who have registered with a nickname and password can make digital works on Noggin.com and save them in their own cubby pages which later the preschooler and their parents can view. 
* Contests and Sweepstakes. Noggin.com may offer parents of preschoolers the opportunity to enter contests and sweepstakes. Noggin.com may ask for the parent or guardian's first name and the e-mail address of a parent or guardian. All the information collected by Noggin.com is used only for the purpose of conducting the contest or sweepstakes. Once the contest or sweepstakes is finished, we then delete any personal information collected. The information collected in our contest or sweepstakes may be passed to a fulfillment house that helps run the contest or sweepstakes, who may not use such information for any other purpose and has agreed to maintain the confidentiality of any information that it receives from Noggin.com. 
* Noggin.com offers parents the opportunity to sign up to receive the Noggin.com newsletter by email. When a parent asks to receive our email newsletter, we ask them to provide his or her email address. Within two business days of receiving this information, we send the parent an email confirming his or her request to receive the Noggin.com newsletter via email on an ongoing basis and give the parent the option to have his or her email be removed from our Noggin.com newsletter database. If at any time after signing up for the newsletter parents wish to be removed for the contact list, they may do so by following the "unsubscribe" instructions found in each Noggin.com newsletter email sent by Noggin. All information collected for Noggin.com newsletters is used only to send the electronic newsletter and may be transferred, disclosed, or shared with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle the preparation and delivery of the electronic newsletter and perform other related technical and processing functions. These third parties may not use it for other purposes and have agreed to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

Cookies and Log Data  
"Cookies" are information files that your web browser places on the hard drive of your computer when you visit a site. Cookies cannot damage user files, nor can they read information from a user's hard drive. Cookies are used to record whether a visitor has indicated that they have certain plug-in software applications installed on their browser. Cookies also allow websites to "remember" user activities on a website as well as user's visits to a site. At Noggin.com cookies are used to determine the number of unique visitors to our website over a given period and to remember non-personally identifiable user-names so that the need for multiple log-ins is eliminated. We do not store any personal information into cookies nor do we link or combine information collected through cookies to any personal information that parents of preschoolers submit online when participating in our activities. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. 

The ads appearing on Noggin.com are delivered to you by a third party ad service provider. In the course of serving ads, the ad service provider may place or recognize their own unique cookie on your browser, and may use non-personally identifiable information about your visit to Noggin.com, such as the number of times that you have viewed an ad. For more information about the third party ad service provider and how to "opt out" of the ad serving cookie, please click here. 

Log data collected on web servers both within Noggin's control and under the control of Noggin's third party ad service provider, who is required to maintain such data on a confidential basis, supplies Noggin with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. Noggin uses such aggregate information to improve access to content based on visitor's browsers and operating system types to make our content available to as many preschoolers as possible. We do not link the log data collected to the personal information that parents of preschoolers submit online when participating in our activities. 

Security & Parental Access  
At Noggin, our goal is to help parents ensure that their preschoolers have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any personal information collected about their preschooler and ask us to correct any factual inaccuracies, delete this information, and/or request that we refrain from further collection or use of their preschooler's information.
