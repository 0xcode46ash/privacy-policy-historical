At Noggin Online, we take the issue of privacy very seriously. Noggin Online does not sell, distribute, barter or transfer personally identifiable information obtained from a user to a third party.

Currently, there are two ways that Noggin collects information online:  


  1. Voluntary submissions 
  2. Cookie technology

**VOLUNTARY SUBMISSIONS** ****

Noggin may collect information from a user through voluntary submissions. Such submissions are made in response to trivia games, or through voluntary submissions of jokes or other materials. Kids are invited to submit e-mail questions, and/or comments. Personally identifiable information (e.g. a child's full name or address) submitted will not be posted by Noggin Online without permission being granted in the form of a signed parental consent. Any personally identifiable information collected through voluntary submissions is not sold, distributed or transferred to any third party.

**COOKIE TECHNOLOGY**

Cookie technology is useful for gathering information such as browser type and operating system. This information helps Noggin create the best possible experience for the user. Any personally information collected by cookies and/or other future technologies will be used in the aggregate.

This policy is reviewed periodically by Noggin Online and may be subject to change.
