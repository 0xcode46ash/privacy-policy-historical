Noggin is the place in cyberspace where Noggin fans can come to find out more about Noggin, play games and have their opinions heard. Noggin believes in the power of kids and we urge both them and their parents to use and enjoy our website. While we encourage the interactive nature of online media, we strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when traveling on the web. Noggin is committed to complying fully with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Our information collection practices are described below. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering any information on any website and we urge parents to discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of personal information to anyone they don't know. 

What Information Is Collected

At Noggin, it is our policy to create website content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Consequently, Noggin generally limits the collection of information from kids to what is known as non-personally identifiable information (e.g. an online nickname). From time to time, however, Noggin may request limited personally identifiable information (e.g. an e-mail address), as explained below, in order to conduct online contests or sweepstakes or offer other activities. Noggin does not condition a kid's participation in any games, the offering of prizes, or other online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in the activity. 

  * General Activities. Kids can take part in a large number of the exciting activities we offer on Noggin without submitting any personally identifiable information about themselves. These activities include playing certain games, sending electronic material (e.g. comics, animations, drawings, music and text) routed through the Noggin server, and making things on our site (e.g. drawings and music). 
  * Sending Electronic Material. Noggin does not require kids to submit personally identifiable information about themselves in order to send electronic materials to a friend, but to send it we do ask them to submit their friend's e-mail address. These e-mail addresses are used only to send the message, and are retained by our server for several hours and then deleted from our system. They are not stored in retrievable form. Noggin also does not require kids to submit personally identifiable information to send electronic materials to Noggin, just their first name, their city or state, and in some cases their age or date of birth.
  * Registered Users. Kids are required to become registered users of Noggin to use our web site's many advanced activities. For some activities, such as playing multi-session games, saving high scores from games, or creating a personal library on Noggin, we do not request any personally identifiable information, but just an online nickname, a password, and in some cases their first name, city or state, and age or date of birth. For other activities, such as making a personal home page or submitting things to Noggin which may be used online, on air, or in other media, kids are also asked to provide their first name, state, date of birth, and their parent's or guardian's e-mail address. We notify the parent or guardian via e-mail and ask them for, among other things, their consent to allow their kid to participate in these activities. Kids that do not submit this information will not be able to participate in these activities. 
  * Contests and Sweepstakes. Kids can also enter online to win prizes in Noggin contests and sweepstakes by providing minimal personal identifying information. Noggin will ask only for the child's first name, his or her e-mail address, and the e-mail address of a parent or guardian, who will be notified of the kid's entry via e-mail and be given the opportunity to withdraw the child from the contest or sweepstakes. 



Use of Information

Noggin uses or may use personally identifiable information that kids provide for contacting them or their parents for marketing purposes, fulfilling online transactions, or conducting contests or sweepstakes, or for record keeping, programming, or otherwise operating its website. Noggin currently does not disclose to third parties personally identifiable information that kids provide. In the event that all or substantially all of Noggin's stock and/or assets are transferred or sold to another entity, Noggin may transfer personally identifiable information to the acquiring entity. 

Cookies and Log Data

"Cookies" are information files which your web browser places on your computer when you visit a site. Noggin is able to access only the cookies that it sets on your computer and we are only able to determine the type of computer operating system and browser that you and other visitors are using. Noggin collects this information in the aggregate in order to improve access to our content based on our visitors' browsers and operating system types thereby making our content available to as many kids as possible. Cookies are also used to record whether a visitor has indicated that they have certain plug-in software applications installed on their browser, and to assist in site navigation. We do not link the information collected through cookies to any personal information that kids may submit online when participating in our activities. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. "Log data" collected on web servers provides Noggin with aggregate information about the number of visits to different pages on our site. We do not link log data to any personal information that kids may submit online when participating in our activities. 

Security & Parental Access

At Noggin, our goal is to help parents ensure that their kids have a safe and fun online experience. That's why we've set up a system by which parents can print out and mail or fax us a signed form that allows them to review any personally identifiable information collected about their child and ask us to correct any factual inaccuracies, delete this information, and/or request that we refrain from further collection or use of their child's information. [You can link to the form from here](https://web.archive.org/pages/infoinquiryform.htm). 

Noggin has taken steps to ensure that any information we collect is secure by, among other things, limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, utilizing electronic security systems, and password protections which guard against unauthorized access. 

To Parents

Noggin urges parents to talk with their kids about online safety and to monitor their kids' activities online. Noggin participates in the Better Business Bureau ("BBB") Online Privacy Seal Program, and the BBB Online Kids Privacy Seal Program. More information about these programs can be obtained at [www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbonline.org/). 

The Noggin website is intended for domestic visitors and is, consequently, specifically directed towards residents of the United States.
