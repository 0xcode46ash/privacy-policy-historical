**Privacy Statement**   
We at Hungry Minds believe that all of the information that we gather about you should be used for no other purpose than to help you find the most rewarding learning products and services available. We will never sell your personal information to other companies. Your privacy is important to us and we will do everything possible to protect it. 

In that spirit, Hungry Minds has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses help us gather broad demographic information. We may use your IP address and cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

Our site's registration form requires users like you to give us contact information (like their name and email address), financial information (like your account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like your ZIP code, age, or income level). We may use your contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and also to contact you when appropriate. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the Choice/opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information may be shared with advertisers on an aggregate basis only. 

This site contains links to other sites. Hungry Minds is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Hungry Minds has several special relationships with partners who co-brand products and services on the Hungry Minds Web site. Other than aggregate user information, no personal information collected from our users will be shared with these partners unless you permit us. 

From time to time, we may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information. 

**Public forums**   
This site makes chat rooms, forums, and message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Choice/opt-out**   
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our partners at the point where we request information about the visitor.
