_Last updated: March 28, 2007_

This privacy statement is subject to change at any time.

NoodleTools, Inc. is the sole owner of any information collected on our site or for subscription registration purposes, including all customer and billing contact information. Usernames, passwords, and IP ranges collected for the purpose of site access authentication are held in the strictest confidence. We will not sell, share, or distribute this information in any way, or use it for any other purpose than for site access authentication.

**1\. Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the userâ€™s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies ARE required for certain parts of the NoodleTools Web site to function correctly, in particular to use NoodleBib.

**2\. Log Files & Usage Statistics**

Log files are generated by the ISP that hosts the NoodleTools Web site. These log files contain information about the users that access the site, including IP addresses. In order to compile usage statistics for subscribing organizations, we also record the date and time that users log in to the system, and from what IP address they log in from.

**3\. Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that NoodleTools, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**4\. Security**

NoodleTools, Inc. does not consider the data transmitted on the Web site to be confidential, so there is no need at this time to handle the transmitted data in a secure fashion (SSL). Bibliographies generated by NoodleBib, for example, are stored in a non-secure location of the Web server, and are potentially (although not easily) accessible to any other Internet user. For this reason, NoodleBib should not be used for sensitive or confidential material. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can contact us via the [Contact Form](https://web.archive.org/about/contact.php).

**5\. Name and E-Mail Privacy**

  * Your name and e-mail address will never be shared with any third party.
  * Your name and e-mail address will never be sold to any person or organization.
  * You will never receive spam of any type as a result of providing us with your e-mail address.
  * In group NoodleBib accounts (school/library/district subscriptions), your name and e-mail address is **not** required in order to create a personal folder. If an e-mail address is provided by the student, it will **only** be used by NoodleBib to send out administrative information to that student regarding their personal folder information. NoodleTools will not contact the student via e-mail unless the student asks a question via e-mail or the contact form.
