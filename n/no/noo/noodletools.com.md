# NoodleTools - Privacy Information

Privacy Statement

This privacy statement is subject to change at any time. 

NoodleTools is the sole owner of any information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties. At this time, NoodleTools does not collect ANY personal information from our users. 

**Registration**   
No registration is required to use the NoodleTools Web site. We do not require any personal information from the user. Use of the site is free without restriction. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Cookies ARE required for certain parts of the NoodleTools Web site to function correctly, in particular to use NoodleBib, the Bibliography Composer. 

**Log Files**   
Log files are generated by the ISP that hosts the NoodleTools Web site. These log files contain information about the users that access the site, including IP addresses and basic demographic information. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**   
We share no data or information with any of our partners or advertisers. 

**Links**   
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that NoodleTools is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Tell-A-Friend**   
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. NoodleTools will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. NoodleTools sends the email immediately, and does not store the name or email information. 

**Security**   
NoodleTools does not consider the data transmitted on the Web site to be confidential, so there is no need at this time to handle the transmitted data in a secure fashion (SSL). Bibliographies generated by NoodleBib, for example, are stored in a non-secure location of the Web server, and are potentially (although not easily) accessible to any other Internet user. For this reason, NoodleBib should not be used for sensitive or confidential material. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to admin@noodletools.com. 

**E-mail Correspondence**   
NoodleTools does not store any personal information about its users, including e-mail addresses. Users will never receive any e-mail correspondence from us unless they e-mail us directly and we send an e-mail response back.
