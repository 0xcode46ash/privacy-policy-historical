Your privacy is important to Nokia. This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") discloses the information practices for this Nokia web site, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how it is used, and with whom it is shared. 

BY ACCESSING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS POLICY, PLEASE DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THIS SITE.

This Policy includes the following sections:  


Applicability of Policy  
This Policy is applicable to the following and only the following Nokia Inc. (Nokia) U.S. operated web sites:   
www.NokiaUSA.com;  
www.Nokia.com/US;  
www.Nokiapromos.com;  
www.Nokiaconnections.com;  
www.nokiahowto.com;  
www.NokiaUnwired.com 

All of the above web sites are collectively referred in this Policy as the "Site". This Policy is not applicable to any other of Nokia's web sites or website-like channels or any other channels or aspects of Nokia's operations, including but not limited, to sales from other sites. 

If you click on a link on this Site that takes you to another site, whether a Nokia site or one operated by any other person or entity, please read that site's privacy policy and site terms or legal policy to make sure that you understand and agree with the terms applicable to your visit of the linked site. 

General Data Collection  
Because Nokia is committed to protecting your privacy, Nokia does not engage in the practice of selling or trading personal data to third parties for promotional purposes. Nokia will not, for example, sell a customer list to an outside party so they can use it to market something to you. 

Nokia only collects, uses or discloses personal information that is necessary for the purposes stated in this Policy, and Nokia only retains it for so long as necessary to fulfill these purposes. 

By using this Site, you acknowledge and consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifying information of the type and for the purposes described in this Policy.

Nokia, including its affiliates in the "Nokia Group" family of companies (those under common control of Nokia's ultimate parent company), may share personal information within the Nokia Group for the purposes described in this Policy. Such sharing may involve transferring data to and from other countries in the world, including countries in the European Union where Nokia has operation and does business. Some countries may provide less legal protection of your personal data. However, in such countries Nokia will still handle information in the manner described in this Policy. Nokia also may provide aggregate statistics, and share general information about this Site's sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

Visitor identification  
In general, you can use this Site for informational purposes without telling Nokia who you are and without providing Nokia any personal information about yourself. From time to time, Nokia or its third party designees may place information on your computer to allow Nokia to identify you. This information is commonly known as "cookies" and many web sites use them and their use for such purposes has become commonplace in the consumer ecommerce industry. Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer's hard drive, and not on this Site. Nokia and/or its third party designees will only view information put on your computer in cookies set by Nokia and/or its third party designees from this Site or other Nokia web sites. 

The use of cookies provides benefits to you, such as eliminating the need for you to enter your password frequently during a session, or re-enter items you place in your shopping cart from visit to visit if you do not finish a transaction on an earlier visit. The information is not personally identifiable; in other words, cookies identify your computer, but not you personally. By showing how and when our visitors use this Site or other Nokia sites, Nokia can continue to improve them. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, you may set your web browser to do so, if your browser so permits. Please understand that if cookies are turned off, you may not be able to view certain parts of this Site that may enhance your visit, nor will you be able to make a purchase on the NokiaUSA.com site. 

Also, this Site uses technology that lets Nokia collect certain technical information, including your Internet protocol address, your computer's operating system, your browser type and the address of any referring web sites for purpose of improving Nokia's service. 

Personal Information - Collection, Use and Sharing  
If this Site permits you to contact Nokia to respond to your questions or fulfill your requests, it may be necessary for Nokia to ask you for personally identifiable information such as your name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. Nokia may use the information you provide Nokia to respond to your requests via mail, e-mail or phone. In addition, if you place an order for a product, request a service or submit content to this Site, Nokia may need to contact you for additional information needed to process or fulfill your order or request. Nokia reserves the right to contact you via phone, mail or e-mail if you make a purchase or request a service to determine your satisfaction with that product or service. 

Nokia will not provide the information submitted to a third party without your permission, except where necessary to process or fulfill your order, including without limitation, providing necessary information to relevant finance-related companies, logistics and transport service providers and authorized after-sales service providers, as well as respond to your requests or answer your inquiries, or in the good faith belief that disclosure of information is reasonably necessary to respond to claims that content you have submitted to this Site violates the rights of third parties or as necessary to protect Nokia's, its web site users' and/or the public's rights, property and/or safety. 

Nokia has the right, but not the obligation, to retain and use such information stored in Nokia's databases and other information obtained from your current or previous activities on this Site for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed any legal requirements or limitations, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce Nokia's legal rights and the terms and conditions of this Policy or this Site's "Site Terms" or "Order Terms of Sale". On rare occasions, Nokia may evaluate your information in order to track users with multiple user ID's or aliases for legal and/or security purposes. 

Providing Nokia with personal information on this Site will not result in your receiving information about Nokia or its products, services or promotions, nor be solicited for any Nokia marketing research activity, unless you elect to "opt in" to receive such communications when prompted to do so. Should you elect to opt-in, Nokia wants to ensure that Nokia respects your preferences for how Nokia communicates with you, so Nokia will give you several different options regarding how Nokia may contact you. You will have the option of advising Nokia whether you prefer that Nokia contact you via regular mail, e-mail, phone, short message service ("SMS"), or multimedia messaging service ("MMS"), location-based services ("LBS"). Should you choose to be contacted via SMS or MMS, for your protection Nokia will use a "confirmed opt-in" process, i.e. before Nokia delivers the first SMS or MMS message to you after your opt-in to such delivery method, you will receive a confirming notice from Nokia which will give you the option to choose to receive or not receive the SMS or MMS message. 

Updating Your Personal Profile  
You have access to the profile that Nokia retains about you for Nokia's marketing purposes (if you have elected to opt-in to receive such communications from Nokia). By clicking [here](http://nokia.bfi0.com/p/Nokia_02/CustomerTriggerEmail) (http://nokia.bfi0.com/p/Nokia_02/CustomerTriggerEmail), you can review or modify this information at any time. You also may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from Nokia at any time by changing your profile on this Site, or clicking on a link provided in any communications received from Nokia (Nokia will work to remove you from marketing communications within approximately three business days after Nokia's receipt of your request). 

Disclosures Required by Law  
If Nokia is compelled by law, court order or other judicial process to disclose any of your personal information to a court or third party, Nokia will attempt to give you prior notice using the contact information you have provided. You hereby authorize Nokia to disclose any information about you for any of the above purposes stated above in the "Personal Information" Section, such as in connection with an investigation of intellectual property infringements or other activity that is illegal or may expose Nokia to legal liability. 

Security  
Nokia has endeavored to take commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to and improper use of your personal information submitted to Nokia via your use of this Site. For example, Nokia uses encryption technology when collecting sensitive data such as credit card information. If this Site supports on-line transactions, it uses security measures available through "Secure Sockets Layer" ("SSL") to protect the confidentiality and security of online transactions. SSL authentication up to 128-bit encryption is used to ensure that credit card information, as well as personal information, submitted as part of the buying process is reasonably safe from third party interception. 

While there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or via SSL or other technologies over the Internet, and no system of technology is completely safe, "tamper" or "hacker-proof", Nokia has endeavored to take reasonable precautions which are appropriate to the sensitivity of the information to prevent and minimize such risks in connection with your use of this Site. 

Minors  
This Site is not directed toward, and does not seek to collect any information from or engage in any transactions with persons under the age of 13 ("Children"). As such, no information may be submitted to this Site by Children, and Nokia requests that minors 13 years of age or older ("Minors") not submit information to this Site without obtaining the consent of a Minor's parent or legal guardian. Additionally, Minors may not make purchases or engage in other legal acts on this Site without such consent, unless permitted by applicable law. 

Policy Changes  
Nokia may change this Privacy Policy, or change, modify or withdraw access to this Site, or the content of the pages on this Site at any time with or without notice. Nokia has posted above the effective date of this version of this Privacy Policy for your reference. If Nokia is going to make a change to this Site's Privacy Policy that will result in a material, adverse change in the way Nokia may handle or use your personally identifiable information that you have submitted to Nokia at this Site, Nokia will post a notice of the change on this page of this Site for at least 30 days prior to our implementation of the change and after the effective date of such changes Nokia will abide by the terms of the Privacy Policy previously in effect until Nokia obtains your consent to such changed terms. However, until Nokia receives your consent to such changed terms, Nokia reserves the right to suspend your usage rights on this Site.
