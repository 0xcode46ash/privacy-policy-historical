## About Callcredit 

Callcredit is committed to the responsible, secure and safe management of consumer data for the purpose of credit referencing, credit scoring and providing electronic proof of your identity. As such, we will check the details you provide with fraud prevention agencies and share your information with them if we suspect a fraud. We may suspect fraud if you provide false or inaccurate information and we will keep a record of this. The “Credit Report Services” (being the provision of the Noddle credit report services and the Confidence Rating Service) demonstrate Callcredit's commitment to upholding transparency in how your data is managed by us by providing you with direct access to your own personal credit file. 

Callcredit is mindful of the importance of upholding the security of information under our control. All data collected through the Noddle website located at [www.noddle.co.uk](http://www.noddle.co.uk/) ('Website') that is stored electronically, is stored on secure servers, and we have stringent security and confidentiality procedures covering the storage and disclosure of such information, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. 

The following Privacy Policy forms part of the Callcredit Services Agreement and will help you to understand how your personal information collected during your use of the Website will be treated by us. 

If you have any queries regarding this Privacy Policy please do not hesitate to contact us at [contact@noddle.co.uk](mailto:contact@noddle.co.uk). 

We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the privacy of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any personal information you disclose on-line. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and transacting over the Internet, and will not hold us responsible for any breach of security, unless this is due to our negligence or wilful default. 

For the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, the data controller is Callcredit Limited of One Park Lane, Leeds, West Yorkshire, LS3 1EP and the nominated representative is Head of Compliance. 

## Consent 

Callcredit has a strong commitment towards the privacy of sensitive information. This Privacy Policy sets out how we use personal information obtained about you during the use of the Website. Your use of the Website signifies that you have given us your consent to such use of your personal information and your agreement to the terms and conditions contained in this Privacy Policy. 

## What personal information do we collect? 

We collect personal information in several ways from different parts of the Website. Any personal information we collect will be used by us strictly in accordance with current data protection legislation and this Privacy Policy. We will store the information we collect from you and hold it electronically or otherwise. 

## Why do we collect your personal information?

We collect personal information from you for the following reasons: 

  1. ###  Verifying your identity: 

We will collect information which will help us to verify your identity, such as email addresses, usernames and passwords, along with other personal information we will need in order to provide you with a copy of your credit file. This will include, for example, your name, date of birth, your residential address and postcode. This information will be checked against external databases, such as the electoral roll and your credit file, to which we have access for this purpose. We will collect and store a record of the check as well as any additional information you provide, including (but not limited to) aliases, previous addresses and financial associations. This information may be disclosed to authorised third parties through our credit referencing, fraud prevention and identification products. 

Occasionally we may ask you to provide documentation for the purpose of verifying your identity, such as utility bills or bank statements. This information will only be requested when we need to verify your current address and we will protect the privacy of such personal information. We store such documentation securely, and it will be destroyed once verification is complete. 

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is identified, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering. Law enforcement agencies may also access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: checking details on applications for credit and credit-related or other facilities; managing credit and credit-related accounts or facilities; recovering debt; checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance; checking details of job applicants and employees. Please email us at [contact@noddle.co.uk](mailto:contact@noddle.co.uk) if you want to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies. We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. 

Further details explaining how the information held by fraud prevention agencies may be used can be obtained by emailing us at [contact@noddle.co.uk](mailto:contact@noddle.co.uk). 

  2. ###  Processing your requests:

As part of the Credit Report Services we will obtain electronic copies of your credit reference file from Callcredit Limited and this will be stored in a private area accessible by you as part of this service. 

Any e-mail or mobile telephone numbers provided to us will be recorded and used to communicate with you in connection with the Credit Report Services or queries concerning the data held within the credit reports. 

  3. ###  Confidence Rating Services: 

Noddle has appointed HD Decisions Limited (“HD”) to provide it with certain data processing services in order to provide you with the Confidence Rating Service. 

By requesting provision of the Confidence Rating Service, you consent to Noddle providing HD with information that you have entered into the Noddle website, together with a copy of your credit file. HD will process this information in accordance with instructions given by Noddle for the sole purpose of providing the Confidence Rating Services (as more clearly set out below). 

HD will (in conjunction with third party credit providers and information provided by them) analyse key elements of your credit file, in order to determine your current financial standing. The analysis of your credit file will be used by HD to identify and rank product offers in order of appropriateness for your circumstances (but this does not necessarily guarantee that there will be appropriate product offers available to you). You will then have the opportunity to apply for the product directly with the third party credit provider should you choose to do so. If you choose to proceed to apply for a product from the ranked list of offers, then the third party credit provider will proceed to carry out its own identification and credit application checks. 

Please note your credit file will not be provided nor will any information be passed to a third party credit provider at any point during this process (unless you subsequently agree to this). The information will be used by HD, at your request, on your behalf, to find the most appropriate product offers for you. 

This process will not have any adverse impact upon your credit standing. 

Please note that the provision of your information, including the credit report, to HD is subject to the Callcredit Terms and Conditions (“Terms and Conditions”). 

  4. ###  Monitoring the relevance of the Credit Report Services: 

In order for us to ensure that our service is user-friendly and to help improve the content and user experience of the Website, the Website automatically gathers information on the number of visitors and readership patterns of the different pages.
