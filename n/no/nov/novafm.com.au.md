**1 Journalism exemption to the Privacy Act**

The Commonwealth Privacy Act seeks to balance the public interest in providing adequate safeguards for the handling of personal information and the public interest in allowing a free flow of information to the public through the media.  
The Privacy Act exempts acts done by a media organisation such as _dmg_ in the course of journalism provided that at the time of the act, the media organisation is publicly committed to observe standards that deal with privacy in the context of the activities of the organisation and those standards are published in writing by the organisation or a person or body representing a class of media organisations.  
 _dmg_ has developed the Journalism Privacy Standards set out in this document and is publicly committed to observe these Standards. Accordingly, _dmg_ is exempt from complying with the National Privacy Principles in respect of its journalism activities.

**2 Definitions**

"Personal information" in these Journalism Privacy Standards means information or an opinion (whether true or not and regardless of its source) about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion.  
"we", "us" and "our" means _dmg_ Radio (Australia) Pty Ltd (ABN 75 093 553 989) and its related bodies corporate and their respective officers and employees.

**3 Application of the Journalism Privacy Standards**

These standards apply to collection, use and disclosure of personal information by us in the course of our journalism activities.

**4 Collection of personal information**

We will collect personal information only where it is in the public interest to do so.  
We will respect an individual's right to protection from unwarranted invasions of privacy.  
Our journalists may collect personal information without revealing their identity where it is in the public interest to do so.  
We will respect the private grief of individuals.

**5 Use of personal information**

Personal information will only be used for the purpose for which it was collected or a directly related and reasonable secondary purpose.  
Personal information obtained by unfair means will not be broadcast or otherwise disclosed unless there are overriding public interest considerations.  
We will not intrude into the privacy of public figures unless the intrusion is related to the individuals' public role or activities or there are overriding public interest considerations.

**6 Quality and accuracy of personal information**

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up-to-date.

**7 Security of personal information**

We will take reasonable steps to protect personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

**8 Confidential sources**

Where it is lawful to do so, we may refuse to do anything which could reveal the identity of a person who gave us personal information in confidence. Where it is lawful to do so and where there are no overriding public interest considerations, we will attempt to ensure that any personal information which we broadcast or otherwise disclose does not identify the source of the information if the information was provided to us in confidence.

**9 Correction**

Where personal information which is materially inaccurate is broadcast or otherwise disclosed, we will take reasonable steps to rectify the disclosure.

**10 Codes of Practice**

The Commercial Radio Codes of Practice registered by the Australian Broadcasting Authority also impose some relevant privacy obligations on us. We are committed to complying with these Codes of Practice.

**11 Privacy Officer**

If you have any concerns, complaints or questions, please contact our Privacy Officer - [stinsley@dmgradio.com.au](mailto:stinsley@dmgradio.com.au)
