#### Use of Your Personal Information

When you provide personal information to Novell, you have entered into a business relationship with Novell and are consenting to the use of that personal information by Novell and its applicable worldwide affiliated companies, resellers, companies working on our behalf in support of a transaction with you, and Novell-owned business entities. For purposes of this policy, an affiliate is a company which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Novell.

Novell and its affiliated companies, resellers, companies working on our behalf and Novell-owned business entities will primarily use your personal information to:

  * Provide you with periodic information about products, upgrades, special offers, services, and events from both Novell and its affiliates 
  * Allow you to purchase and/or download products and/or receive support or other services for Novell or its affiliate's products
  * Deliver information regarding products or services that you request or purchase
  * Gather demographic information about Novell web site visitor trends
  * Allow you to access limited-entry areas of our site as appropriate
  * Ensure our site is relevant to your needs
  * Your information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Novell or its affiliates, contractors, or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country in compliance with applicable law.



Novell may send out periodic emails of a transactional nature including, without limitation, those informing you of a technical service or security issues related to a product or service you have requested or purchased, or confirming your request or purchase of a product or service. You will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the service you have chosen.

#### Sharing of Your Personal Information

Except as described herein, Novell will not sell, rent or lease your personal information to others. Novell shares personal information with its affiliated companies, resellers, companies working on our behalf and Novell-owned business entities. We will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent. Certain Novell affiliates are designated resellers of Novell products, and employees of such affiliates may serve as your primary contact with Novell. Additionally, some Novell services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company or affiliate. If you register for or use such services, both Novell and the other company may receive information collected as part of the co-branded services.

If you request something from a Novell web site (for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials), we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, such as Novell's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, and postal or government authorities (e.g., Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. As part of a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.

In some cases Novell uses contractors to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. It is Novell's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Novell's policies. Novell may also allow Novell partners to participate in limited marketing campaigns solely to promote Novell's products and services to you.

We may access and/or disclose your personal information if we believe such action is necessary or advisable to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Novell; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Novell (including the enforcement of our agreements); (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of employees, users of Novell services, members of the public or others; or (d) in connection with an asset sale of an Novell product line, or of substantially all of the business of Novell.
