# NOVELL: Privacy

  


Novell Online Privacy Policy 

We at Novell value the relationship we have with our customers and web site visitors, and are committed to responsible information handling practices. We take the privacy of our customers very seriously and want you to feel comfortable whenever you visit our web sites, access our online services, or participate in our online offerings. Although our web sites have unique services and offerings, they share a similar privacy philosophy. Therefore, we drafted this corporate online privacy policy to represent Novell's general privacy approach to the information practices of our web sites. In addition to this privacy policy, you can find specific web site privacy statements that provide more detailed information about the web site data handling practices-see links below: 

Novell Privacy Principles 

Our approach to responsible information handling is founded on the basis of the Fair Information Practices, the cornerstone of which is providing notice of our information practices and other privacy aspects in order to allow individuals to make informed decisions regarding personally identifiable information. Furthermore, Novell has adopted leading industry practices as set forth by the [Online Privacy Alliance](http://www.privacyalliance.org/), [Direct Marketing Association](http://www.the-dma.org/), and [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/). As a sponsor and member of TRUSTe, you will see the TRUSTe seal on many of our web sites and on pages that request information from you. You may click through the seals to reach the site privacy policy or validate our privacy certification for that site. 

As a licensee of TRUSTe, we have established the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our web sites:

When you provide personally identifiable information to us that may be used for secondary purposes (i.e., uses not related to the purpose for which the information was collected), we give you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses. 

WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO UPDATE OR CORRECT THE CONTACT INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE PROVIDED TO US.

We have a variety of mechanisms for you to modify and update the contact information that you have provided to us and are in the process of developing more mechanisms to update your personal data. When you visit our web sites, we let you know in our privacy statements how you may currently modify the contact information that you have provided. 

WE PROTECT PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.
