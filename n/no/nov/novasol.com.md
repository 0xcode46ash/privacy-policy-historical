This is information such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and any opinion-research we are asking you. This information is saved, along with information about what type of stay you would like to book, when and which reference number. This information makes us able to complete the booking, i.e. print your travel documents etc. Furthermore this information can be used for statistical purposes when evaluating our range of products etc., and for sending any offline material, like brochures or flyers with offers for the season to come.

### Terms of payment

When paying with credit card, we ask you to supply the name of the credit card holder, credit card number, expiry date and the Card Verification Code.This information is not stored with us, but in encryptet form on secured servers at Telecom Scandinavia who is our external partner. All communication concerning your payment is proceeded under a SSL certificate, which ensures your safety. You can therefore safely pay with credit card on the web sites of NOVASOL.

### Your e-mail address

When placing a booking with us, we recommend that you supply your e-mail address.

### Information gathered

When moving around on our web site, we gather information on which pages you visit and for how long. This information is gathered in the background without you noticing.

### For how long is the information kept?

The information gathered is kept for up to 5 years.

### How is the data kept?

The data is kept non-encryptet but protected against unauthorized use. We use a firewall to protect unauthorized access to our systems and thereby protecting your personal data. A firewall is protecting our internal network against unauthorized access from the Internet.
