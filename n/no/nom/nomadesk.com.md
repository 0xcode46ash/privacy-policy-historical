## How do we improve our software?

At Nomadesk, we strive to continuously improve the quality of our software. In addition to our development process, we also monitor the quality of our products by collecting information about errors and problems. The information helps us to diagnose problems so we can further improve our software and service(s).

## How do we collect information?

If a problem occurs in our software program, a report is automatically sent to our server. You are not prompted to review the information that is sent out because no personal information is collected.

## What types of information do we collect?

The reporting service collects information about problems that occur behind the scenes while you work with Nomadesk. It is important to diagnose errors that occur behind the scenes because these problems, if left unsolved, may cause additional problems such as performance or program failures.

Reports contain information that is most useful for diagnosing and solving the problem that has occurred, such as:

  * In what part of the software the problem occurred
  * Type of the problem



Your Internet Protocol (IP) address is also collected because you are connecting to our servers and to allow you to Theftguard your files.

Reports might unintentionally contain personal information, but this information is not used to identify you.

## Who can use the information and how can it be used?

Nomadesk uses information about errors and problems to improve the software and services. Nomadesk employees may be provided access to information collected by the reporting service. However, they may use the information only to diagnose and repair issues or improve the Nomadesk products.

## Information storage, processing and release:

Information that we collect may be stored and processed in the United States or Belgium. Nomadesk abides to the policy regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. Nomadesk may disclose this information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Nomadesk; (b) protect or defend the rights or property of Nomadesk, or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of Nomadesk employees, users of Nomadesk software or services, or members of the public.

Nomadesk occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as providing customer support, processing transactions. Nomadesk will provide these companies only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.

## Security practices:

Nomadesk is committed to helping protect the security of the information we collect. The Error Reporting Service uses multiple security technologies and procedures to help protect information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, reports are sent to Microsoft from your computer using encryption technology. The information is then stored on computer servers with controlled access.
