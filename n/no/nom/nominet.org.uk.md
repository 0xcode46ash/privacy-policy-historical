# Nominet:Data Protection & Privacy Statements

  
Data Protection & Privacy Statements

* * *

**Data Protection**

Nominet is registered with the Information Commissioner to process personal data, and we are required to abide by the data protection principles which are based on a European Union Directive and which seek to ensure a high level of protection for personal data throughout the European Economic Area (i.e. the European Union, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Note that data which is not about individuals is not protected in this way.

You may write to us to request a copy of the personal data held by us about you. We may charge a reasonable fee for the provision of such data. As required by the Data Protection Act 1998, we will adopt appropriate security procedures in relation to the storage and disclosure of information provided by you in order to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of your identity before we are able to disclose personal information to you. Other than the uses identified below, we will not disclose your personal information to others. 

**Registrants of a .uk Domain Name**

If you register a Domain Name under the .uk top level domain, you are subject to our terms and conditions. Clause 6 of those terms and conditions sets out how we will process your data, which includes; publishing your details on the register, posting information on the WHOIS database (subject only to a consumer opt-out), using the information in the Public Register Subscription Service (or any successor or replacement service); and providing information to third parties with a legitimate reason to know that information (e.g. your Tag Holder, if you have registered via one).

You should be aware that personal data posted on the WHOIS database may be accessible to countries outside the European Economic Area. By registering a Domain Name you consent to your personal data being transferred out of the European Economic Area and to our use of your personal data for the purposes specified above.

**Members & Tag Holders**

Nominet is a company limited by guarantee. This means that we do not have shareholders, but we do have members. Nominet therefore holds information about its members which it uses for administration and fulfilling our obligations to members.

'Tag Holders' is the name that Nominet gives to various organisations (including many ISPs) who it permits to directly register, administer and maintain domain names, on behalf of Registrants. Nominet holds information on its Tag Holders and this information may be available to the public if they request it.

**Cookies & IP Addresses**

Nominet UK does not use cookies. We will use IP address information both anonymously to track traffic flows and on a named basis to confirm user identities in relation to controlling system abuse and the security of our computer systems.

**LEGAL STATEMENTS**

**Disabled Access**

Nominet has attempted to make its website accessible to those with disability. If you are experiencing difficulty with any part of the site and require assistance please email customer service: [nominet@nominet.org.uk](mailto:nominet@nominet.org.uk) or phone: 01865 332211. If you have any suggestions as to how the site may be made more accessible to disabled people, please email our communications department: [website@nominet.org.uk](mailto:website@nominet.org.uk).

**Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations**

Details of a consumer's right to cancel their registration of a domain name and other information required by statute is set out in our [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/ReferenceDocuments/TermsAndConditions/TermsAndConditions.html). In brief, there is a right to cancel (for consumers) the registration of a domain name provided that you notify us of this within the time limit. If this is done, we will provide you with a refund. However, not that Nominet's fees may only form a small part of the overall fee you have paid to an internet service provider or other company. For requesting on-line tag changes or on-line transfers of domain names (when these services are available) a consumer's right to cancel will end once we start providing the services to you. In particular, as part of those processes we will provide you with a form. Although you are not obligated to complete the process, you cannot cancel the contract and request a refund at that stage. Fees information is available on our [Fees](https://web.archive.org/RegisteringYourDomainName/RegistrationFees/RegistrationFees.html) page. Changes in our terms and conditions and fees are advertised on our web pages and until such notice our current terms and conditions and fees apply.

**E-Commerce Regulations and other Information**

Nominet UK operates this site from the United Kingdom. For our contact details see the ['Contact us' ](https://web.archive.org/ContactUs/ContactUs.html)  section of the site. We are a not-for-profit English company limited by guarantee (Number 3203859). Our VAT number is 663 4990 03.

Records of registrations, attempted registrations and other transactions are kept by our computers, and are not generally accessible to the public, except to the extent that details released through the WHOIS facility. We do not keep copies of the full text of contracts. Other information is released on specific grounds permitted under relevant data protection legislation.

Most users register via Tag Holders or other agents, and so the exact method to register the Domain Name and correct errors will depend on your Tag Holder or other agent. Those who do wish to register directly will find information [here](https://web.archive.org/RegisteringYourDomainName/DirectRegistrations/DirectRegistrations.html)  on the site or may ring our customer services department on 01865 332211 for information.

Tag holders may directly access certain of our systems (on the terms of our tag holder agreement with them), which allows them to identify and correct errors made.

When we have received payment for your domain registration (which may be some time after you pay any money to the Tag Holder) we will send you (either directly, or via your agent) a confirmation of registration form to the address given to us, and this includes a reply form which may be returned to us to correct any errors made. In additions, they may contact us by email, phone or fax to request changes, although such requests must follow Nominet procedures, which the Nominet customer service or registrations department will explain at the relevant time.

Nominet only operates in, and contracts in, English although certain second level domains (e.g. .co.uk) are open to anyone in the world in accordance with our [Rules](https://web.archive.org/ReferenceDocuments/Rules/Rules.html) .

Nominet does not oversee or subscribe to any codes of practice.
