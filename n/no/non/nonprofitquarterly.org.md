# Privacy Policy - Non Profit News | Nonprofit Quarterly

The _Nonprofit Quarterly_ ( _NPQ_ ) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting [www.nonprofitquarterly.org](https://nonprofitquarterly.org/) or [our ordering website](https://online.icnfull.com/npc/?action=SUBSCRIPTION&base_country=US), or though social media correspondence (such as _NPQ_ ‘s [Facebook profile](https://www.facebook.com/TheNonprofitQuarterly/) or [Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/npquarterly)), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

### The Simple Version

We use your contact information for in-house purposes only, and do not share any information about you with third parties. Registration and purchases made through our website also opt you into our e-newsletters, from which you’re able to unsubscribe at any time. We think, though, that you’ll like them quite a bit.

### What Personal Information Does NPQ Gather?

**Information You Give Us**

We receive and store any information you enter into our website or give us in any other way. This includes subscribing to our magazine or e-Newsletters, purchasing back issues, special reprints, or other products, donating to us, or submitting a form (such as a comment) on our website. We ask for personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your message. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we may not be able to fulfill your request or complete your order, but you will still be free to browse the other sections of the websites owned and administered by _NPQ_.

From time to time, we will send you e-mail announcements about new features, products, and services from _NPQ_ and selected advertisers and affiliates. The quality news and information on NonprofitQuarterly.org and the print magazine are supported by advertising revenue, and a controlled program of e-mail marketing is an important element of our online publishing business. We limit the amount of advertising you receive. On occasion, we will send subscription solicitations to your e-mail or postal mailbox. Some demographic data, volunteered through our annual surveys, are used statistically to provide our advertisers with an accurate profile of our overall readership. We never make any personal data collected from these surveys available to a third party.

### E-mail Communications

We publish the [NPQ e-Newsletter](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/) on a monthly basis, and the [Nonprofit Newswire](https://web.archive.org/newsletters/) daily.

Occasionally we may send announcements about _NPQ_ events or products to the mailing list. We do not rent our e-mail list, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event, or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner.

### Social Media & Comments

_NPQ_ uses social media such as website comments, and networks like Facebook and Twitter, to engage readers in dialogue. As mentioned above, _NPQ_ makes use of data collected via these functions on our website. On other networks, we abide by the terms and conditions of that website/service, and reserve the right to use those networks for marketing purposes. Comments made on NonprofitQuarterly.org and _NPQ_ ‘s Facebook account are reviewed and published at our discretion, and through the use of these functions you accept that _NPQ_ is permitted to edit, moderate, and reuse comments for in-house promotional materials. Promotions and advertising are not permitted in this medium, nor is derogatory or hateful speech.

### Automatic Information

When you visit any of our websites, our servers make a log of basic information corresponding to the sites and pages you have visited. This information is stored primarily to track the effectiveness of our websites and individual sections and pages within them. At this time, our general website does not use cookies (alphanumeric identifiers that can be stored by a visitor’s browser to identify them on a future visit, or during a single visit), but they are used on our ordering website to keep track of the items in your shopping cart.

### How Secure Is Information about Me?

All computers that receive or store personal information are secured by firewalls and other security measures. Additionally, sensitive data such as credit card numbers are encrypted using SSL and other industry standard measures, to provide an additional level of security.

### Conditions of Use and Revisions

If you have any concern about privacy at nonprofitquarterly.org or any of our websites, please send us a description of your concern to [info@nonprofitquarterly.org](mailto:info@nonprofitquarterly.org), and we will try to resolve it. Changing business practices and circumstances may require that we make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this website.
