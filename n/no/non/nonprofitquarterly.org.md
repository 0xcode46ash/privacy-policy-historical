# The Nonprofit Quarterly | Privacy Policy

James David Morgan      
  
Last Updated: 6/24/2009

The Nonprofit Quarterly (NPQ) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. By visiting [www.nonprofitquarterly.org](https://web.archive.org/), or [our ordering website](http://store.nonprofitquarterly.org/), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice.

### What Personal Information does NPQ Gather?

**Information You Give Us**

We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes subscriptions to our magazine or e-Newsletter, purchasing back issues, special reprints or other products, donating to us, or submitting a form on our website. We ask for personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your message. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we may not be able to fulfill your request or complete your order, but you will still be free to browse the other sections of the websites owned and administered by NPQ. 

We will never rent or give away your e-mail address to anyone, nor will we share information from your NonprofitQuarterly.org profile.  On occasion, we will send subscription solicitations to your e-mail or postal mailbox.  Some demographic data, volunteered through our annual surveys, is used statistically to provide our advertisers with an accurate profile of our overall readership. We never make any personal data collected from these surveys available to a third party.

**Email Communications**

We publish the [NPQ e-Newsletter](http://oldsite.nonprofitquarterly.org/section/70.html) on a monthly basis. The e-newsletter is distributed by email, although [back issues](https://web.archive.org/section/70.html) may also be viewed on our website. You may [subscribe to](https://web.archive.org/scripts/enews/sub) or [unsubscribe from](https://web.archive.org/scripts/enews/un) the email list at any time. Occasionally we may send announcements about NPQ events or products to the mailing list. We do not rent our email list, although we may occasionally send an announcement, event or product offering that we think may be of interest on behalf of a partner. If you wish to be excluded from these communications while remaining on the NPQ e-Newsletter list, you may send an email indicating this request to [options@lists.nonprofitquarterly.org](mailto:options@lists.nonprofitquarterly.org) .

**Automatic Information**

When you visit any of our websites, our servers make a log of basic information corresponding to the sites and pages you have visited. This information is stored primarily to track the effectiveness of our websites and individual sections and pages within them. At this time our general website does not use cookies (alphanumeric identifiers that can be stored by a visitor's browser to identify them on a future visit, or during a single visit), but they are used on our ordering website to keep track of the items in your shopping cart.

**How Secure Is Information about Me?**

All computers that receive or store personal information are secured by firewalls and other security measures. Additionally, sensitive data such as credit card numbers are encrypted using SSL and other industry standard measures, to provide an additional level of security. 

**Conditions of Use and Revisions**

If you have any concern about privacy at nonprofitquarterly.org or any of our websites, please send us a description of your concern to [info@nonprofitquarterly.org](mailto:info@nonprofitquarterly.org) , and we will try to resolve it. Changing business practices and circumstances may require that we make changes to this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this website.
