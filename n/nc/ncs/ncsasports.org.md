# National Collegiate Scouting Association :: Privacy Policy

## Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to the National Collegiate Scouting Association, hereafter referred to as NCSA. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the NCSA website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number
  * Payment Information (Debit/Credit/ACH)
  * Scholastic Information
  * Athletic Information
  * Other Miscellaneous Information   




## The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when you sign up for our service to aid in providing our service to you. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that service. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our newsletter as well as updates on our new products and services. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form.

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

## Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. This web site is not directed to children under 13 years of age. The policy of NCSA, as the operator of this web site, is NOT knowingly trying to collect any personal information from children under 13, including "individually identifiable information," as defined by the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). If NCSA did knowingly collect personal information from children under 13, it would do so in accordance with COPPA. 

## How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information 

You can access and update all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by [logging into your online account](http://recruit-match.ncsasports.org/fasttrack/login/clientHome.jsp) and making the appropriate updates. If you have forgotten your login credentials you can retrieve those via our [automated password retrieval system](http://recruit-match.ncsasports.org/fasttrack/ClientForgotPassword.do). 

You may also update your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting our office via the phone and/or address below. You must be able to identify the information you provided to us during your registration process.  We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error.

To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
