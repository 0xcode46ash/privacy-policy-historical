# Privacy Policy

The National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) is committed to protecting your privacy. The information that you furnish to NCBE is the property of NCBE and the admission authority of the jurisdiction to which you are applying. We do not sell or rent this information or share this information with others in any way that we have not mentioned in this statement.

#### Security

NCBE has physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in conformance to industry standards to protect your personal information. We limit access to your personal information to NCBE employees and agents whom we believe reasonably need that information to do their jobs. Your account information is password protected. We use industry-standard SSL encryption to protect data transmissions.

#### The Information We Collect

NCBE's web server monitors traffic by automatically recording every visitor's host, domain name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type, and/or IP address. The information we collect includes the number of times the site is visited, how many visitors come to the site, which parts of the site visitors frequent, and the length of time of each visit. This information is limited to pages visited within our website, does not contain personally identifying information, and is used to evaluate areas of interest and to improve the NCBE website. NCBE does not share this information with any other organizations.

When you use the NCBE Character and Fitness Application, the MBE Score Services Request Form, the MPRE Score Services Request Form, the UBE Score Transcript Request Form, the NCBE Study Aids Store, or when you create an NCBE account, we collect personal information such as name, address, Social Security number, residences, and/or employers. We also collect personal information in an optional survey when you purchase an Online Practice Exam. All information solicited and received in these situations is treated confidentially by NCBE and restricted to official use by NCBE and/or the proper admitting authorities.

#### Credit Card Transactions

All credit card transactions are processed through iTransact via SSL ([view iTransact’s privacy policy](http://www.itransact.com/about/privacy-policy/ "Leaving NCBE website")).  NCBE does not disclose credit card information for any other purpose.

#### Cookies

Cookies are used by NCBE to keep track of your login information while you are logged in to our website. Information transferred through cookies does not contain any personally identifying information, nor is it shared with any other parties.

#### Account Editing and Deletion

Within our website, we offer the ability to change your password and other account preferences and information.

If you wish to delete your NCBE Character and Fitness Application, please contact us and we will remove all of your information from our website. Below is the policy used in determining when an application is deleted from our server:

  * An unused application will be deleted after 90 days. 
  * An application that is never received by NCBE will be deleted after 1 year of disuse. 
  * An application that is processed by NCBE will remain on our server for 5 years from the date we receive the application. As long as your application remains online, its data can be transferred into a new account for a supplemental report or an application to another jurisdiction (with certain exceptions).
