# Privacy Policy - NCBE

Date Updated: June 3, 2015

The National Conference of Bar Examiners (NCBE) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes our practices and procedures as they relate to information we collect through our website (the “Site”) located at [www.ncbex.org](http://www.ncbex.org/ "NCBE web site Home page"). NCBE owns the information collected. By providing personal information online, you consent to allow NCBE to use that information in accordance with this Policy.

##### Information We Collect and How We Use It

###### Personal Information

You are not required to provide any personal information to browse or access the public area of the Site. However, to access or use certain services at the Site, you are required to provide personal information. “Personal information” is information that is unique to you, and includes, but is not limited to, your email address, telephone number, name, date of birth, Social Security or national identification number, and information regarding your legal education, background, credentials, and related matters. Information you supply when requesting ADA accommodations for the MPRE is subject to an [additional privacy policy](http://www.ncbex.org/exams/mpre/ada-accommodations/).

Personal information is collected on the Site when you create an NCBE Account, register online for the MPRE, complete the NCBE Character and Fitness Application, request score services, send a message using the Contact Us form, purchase products through the NCBE Study Aids Store, or complete an optional survey related to the purchase of an Online Practice Exam. NCBE also collects information about changes made to your NCBE Account profile.

NCBE uses your personal information for the purposes described where it is collected. Generally, NCBE uses your personal information for identification purposes; to provide services and products requested by you; and to provide services, such as score transfers and character and fitness services, to bar admission agencies or attorney regulatory authorities in jurisdictions to which you are applying for admission, have previously applied for admission, or are admitted. Additionally, NCBE uses personal information to protect you and NCBE from fraudulent transactions, and to investigate inappropriate or unauthorized use of NCBE services, accounts, or intellectual property or other assets. NCBE may use aggregated personal information for research and statistical purposes related to bar admissions and bar examinations. NCBE does not use personal information for marketing or promotional purposes.

###### Cookies and Tracking Technologies

Cookies are used by NCBE to keep track of your login information while you are logged in to the Site. Information transferred through cookies does not contain any personally identifying information, nor is it shared with any other parties. We use non-persistent cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. These non-persistent cookies are deleted when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use the Site but your ability to use some areas of the Site will be limited.

NCBE's web server monitors traffic by automatically recording every visitor's host, domain name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type, and/or IP address. We use Google Analytics to track interaction with specific features of our website. We do not (and do not allow any third party to) use this service to track, collect, or upload any data that personally identifies an individual, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information by Google. For information on how Google Analytics collects and processes data, please review “How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps” located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/).

###### Credit Card Information

All credit card transactions are processed through iTransact or Authorize.Net via SSL. (View [iTransact’s privacy policy](http://itransact.com/about/privacy-policy/) and [Authorize.Net's privacy policy](http://www.authorize.net/company/privacy/).) Your credit card information is used to bill you for services. NCBE does not use credit card information for any other purpose. NCBE does not store or disclose credit card information.

##### Security

NCBE has physical, technical, and administrative safeguards in place to protect your personal information. We use industry-standard secure socket layer technology (SSL) to encrypt data transmissions. To learn more about SSL, view <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.htm>. Despite our security measures, no data transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. As a result, we cannot and do not warrant the security of your personal information.

Messages that you send to us by email, including by use of the [Contact Us form](http://www.ncbex.org/contact/) on the Site, may not be secure, and use of email is not recommended for sending confidential or sensitive information to us.

##### Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

NCBE may disclose your personal information to bar admission agencies, or to other third parties with whom we have a direct or indirect business or contractual relationship, in order to deliver and support the products and services that NCBE provides. For example, we may disclose your personal information, such as name, date of birth, Social Security number, and NCBE Number, to third parties that use and/or administer our examinations for purposes of accurately reporting your exam scores and ensuring exam integrity and security.

NCBE may disclose your personal information to bar admission agencies for purposes of character and fitness investigations, including, but not limited to, disclosure of the jurisdictions to which you have previously applied and the dates of any such applications.

NCBE reserves the right to use or disclose your personal information when NCBE reasonably believes it is needed to (i) respond to information requests by law enforcement or other governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena or other legal process, or court order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud, malicious activity, or inappropriate, unauthorized, or illegal activity involving our examinations, services, or networks; or (iv) enforce or protect our rights and property, including intellectual property. In these four circumstances, NCBE may disclose your personal information without notice to such third parties as we deem reasonably necessary.

##### How to Access or Correct Your Personal Information

Access to your personal information is available through your [NCBE Account](http://accounts.ncbex.org/php/ncbe_number/). Log in to your account to edit your account profile or to change your password or email address. We keep a record of changes (including deletions) and may disclose or use the record for lawful purposes, including investigation of fraudulent, inappropriate, unauthorized, or illegal activity or for security purposes.

Certain NCBE services may have specific processes for correcting or updating personal information, such as information submitted in a character and fitness application or associated with a test registration. Refer to the specific instructions for those services or contact NCBE for instructions.

If you request to close your NCBE Account, we will mark your account as “Closed” but will keep your account information in our database in order to deter fraud and to prevent transfer or sharing of accounts.

##### Data Retention

Except as set forth in this section regarding your NCBE Character and Fitness Application, NCBE will retain your personal information for as long as we deem appropriate and necessary.

We follow these policies in determining when an NCBE Character and Fitness Application may be deleted from our website server:  
• An unused application may be deleted after 90 days.  
• An application that is never received by NCBE may be deleted after one year of disuse.  
• An application that is processed by NCBE will remain on our server for 5 years from the date we receive the application. As long as your application remains online, you can transfer its data into a new application for a supplemental report to the same jurisdiction or new report to another jurisdiction (with certain exceptions).  
• An application to North Carolina or to Michigan by Exam will remain on our server for one year from the date the application is received by the respective admissions office.

If you wish to delete your NCBE Character and Fitness Application, please contact us and we will remove it from our website server.

##### Links

For your convenience, we may provide links to other websites and web pages that we do not control. NCBE does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such linked websites. If you submit information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. With the exception of the MPRE registration website hosted by LSAC, use of any linked websites is at the user’s own risk.

##### Children’s Privacy

This website is not designed to attract children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly collect personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.

##### Changes to This Privacy Policy

If we change our policies, the changes will be posted to this privacy policy on the Site. At our discretion, we may also provide notice in the NCBE Accounts and on other pages of the Site as we deem appropriate. NCBE reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it periodically or before you provide us with additional personal information.
