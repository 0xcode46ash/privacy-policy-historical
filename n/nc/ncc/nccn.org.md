Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes for conference registration fees and/or hotel deposits. If NCCN cannot process an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. NCCN encourages users to be aware when they leave the NCCN site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

#### Security

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When NCCN’s registration forms ask users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry-standard encryption software - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as a registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just “surfing.” 

While NCCN uses SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, NCCN also does everything in its power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in NCCN offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure, locked environment. 

If users have any questions about the security at www.nccn.org, they can [send an e-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20061212051247id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?ID=4). 

#### Supplementation of Information 

For this web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users, it is necessary for NCCN to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. 

**Address Verification**

NCCN uses PCCharge Pro for credit card processing services to verify a user’s address for credit card processing. 

#### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, NCCN provides a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by [E-mailing](https://web.archive.org/web/20061212051247id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website) our User Support. 

#### Notification of Changes

If NCCN decides to change its privacy policy, NCCN will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places deemed appropriate so our users are always aware of what information NCCN collects, how it is used, and under what circumstances, if any, NCCN discloses it. NCCN will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, NCCN is going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, NCCN will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not NCCN uses their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if NCCN makes any material changes in its privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, NCCN will post a prominent notice on its web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where NCCN posts a notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

#### Contact Information

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20061212051247id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website).
