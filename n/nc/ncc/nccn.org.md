# NCCN Privacy Policy

## NCCN Privacy Statement

The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc., (NCCN) is issuing this privacy statement to keep you, our valued user, informed of activities in place to ensure your privacy. This privacy statement covers the site WWW.NCCN.ORG. If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, they should first contact Alex Yakovlev, Director, Information Systems, by [E-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207002021id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?ID=3) or telephone (215-690-0258). 

## Information Collection and Use

#### Information Collection

NCCN is the sole owner of the information collected on WWW.NCCN.ORG. NCCN collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

_Clinical Practice Guidelines Registration_

We request information on a voluntary basis from the user on our Professional Clinical Practice Guidelines site. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has expressed interest and to advise users about future updates to this site. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as specialty or year of graduation), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

_Conference Registration_

We request information from the user on our conference registration order form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and mailing address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes for conference registration fees. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

_Guidelines Orders_

We request information from the user on our Treatment Guidelines for Patients and professional Clinical Practice Guidelines CD-ROM order forms. A user must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address). This information is used to fill requester’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. 

#### Information Use

**Profile**

We store information that we collect through log files and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to our Web site, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and user activity within this Web site to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Webtrends that uses log files to analyze user movement. 

**Communications from the Site**

_Special Offers and Updates_

Established users of the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines will occasionally receive information on programs or services. 

_Service Announcements_

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

**Sharing**

_Legal Disclaimer_

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)_

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. For example, we may describe the number of users by geography or medical specialty. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

_Third Party Intermediaries_

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders for NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines on CD-ROM, and a credit card processing company to bill users for conference registration. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, National Comprehensive Cancer Network, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. Registration for NCCN’s annual conference consists of a link to a site hosted by Peopleware; to view their Internet Registration Module Security statement, go to <http://www.pware.com/admin/securityStatement.htm> . 

#### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the industry-standard encryption software - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page, such as our registration form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just ‘surfing’. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure, locked environment. 

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can [send an E-mail](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207002021id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?ID=4). 

#### Supplementation of Information 

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. 

**Address Verification**

We use PCCharge Pro for credit card processing services to verify a user’s address for credit card processing. 

#### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users’ personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by [E-mailing](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207002021id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website) our User Support. 

#### Notification of Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users’ personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. 

#### Contact Information

If users have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20050207002021id_/http%3A//www.nccn.org/about/emailform.asp?department=website).
