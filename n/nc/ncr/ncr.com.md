# NCR - Privacy Policy

As a leading producer of customer transaction solutions, NCR has long been concerned about protecting personal information it gathers about its employees and customers. NCR (as a member of the national trade association for the information technology industry - now ITI) adopted its first set of privacy principles in 1971. 

NCR also considers data protection a customer satisfaction issue. We seek to meet all customer expectations in our solutions, products and services-and in our business practices. We will meet the customer demand for privacy protection. 

NCR believes that individuals have the right to be informed about the information being collected about them and about its intended use. People should also have the right to "opt out" if they do not wish to have personal data used for other purposes. They should also have the right to review information being retained and the means to update and correct it.
