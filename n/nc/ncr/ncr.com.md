# Privacy Policy

### **NCR Privacy Policy**

### **(Last Updated:   February 7, 2014)**

NCR Corporation, its affiliates and its subsidiaries (collectively “NCR”) is committed to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information (as defined below) about you that we collect, use, or disclose or otherwise Process (as defined below), including Personal Information to which NCR has access in connection with the provision of products and services to our customers (in this Privacy Policy, “you” includes any individual about whom NCR collects, uses, or discloses Personal Information).  NCR takes reasonable and appropriate steps to safeguard this information in accordance with the applicable laws of the countries in which we conduct business and our contractual requirements.

#### Scope of this Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to any Personal Information that NCR collects, uses, or discloses regardless of how or where that information was obtained, or where it is stored or used, unless otherwise noted either in this Privacy Policy, in a supplement, or in a separate policy that we make available to you.

#### Definitions

**“Contract Data** ” means Personal Information about our customers’ customers or our customers’ personnel that NCR Processes in connection with providing products and services to a customer under a customer contract.  Contract Data is a subset of “Personal Information.”

**“Personal Information”** means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person to the extent such information is afforded the protection of law. An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to the individual’s physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity.

**“Process”** means any operation or set of operations which is performed upon Personal Information, whether or not by automatic means, such as collection, recording, organization, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, blocking, erasure, or destruction.

#### NCR Customer Obligations with Respect to Contract Data

In furtherance of the provision of products and services under certain of our customer contracts, NCR may Process Contract Data covered by this Privacy Policy for, and at the direction of, our customers. In such situations, NCR acts solely as a processor and relies on its customers to comply with applicable legal requirements.  Except as otherwise noted, the NCR customer’s privacy policy, and not this Privacy Policy, applies to such Processing.

#### Collection of Personal Information

The Personal Information NCR may collect about you includes, but is not limited to, user IDs and passwords; demographic information; contact details, such as your name, address, email address, or telephone number; geo-location data; or education or employment data.

You may provide Personal Information to NCR in a variety of ways, such as by registering for an on-line account or event, joining a mailing list, purchasing a product or service, applying for employment, filling out an information form, or otherwise contacting us with a question, comment, or request.  Additionally, NCR may collect information about you or obtain Personal Information from third parties. NCR may also use certain technologies to collect information about you while you are visiting an NCR website, as described **below**.  NCR will obtain Personal Information about you only by fair and lawful means.

With respect to Contract Data, it is our customers’ responsibility to ensure that NCR‘s collection and processing of their customers’ Personal Information is consistent with the terms of such customers’ own privacy policies.

#### Use of Personal Information

NCR will use Personal Information covered by this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with applicable law and that is reasonably necessary to fulfill its business needs, including facilitating NCR’s compliance with regulatory and legal requirements. NCR may combine Personal Information it obtains about you from various other sources to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness, and to help us better tailor our interactions with you. NCR will retain Personal Information only for so long as it is helpful to support the overall purpose(s) for which NCR collected the information. NCR’s use may include, but is not limited to, making sales calls, sending marketing communications, delivering or completing requested services or transactions, and analyzing a series of transactions.

NCR will use Contract Data consistent with applicable contractual obligations and applicable law.   NCR also may use Contract Data to facilitate compliance with regulatory and legal requirements.

**_Sales and Marketing._ NCR may use your **Personal Information for sales and marketing purposes, including contacting you for feedback in customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes, providing you with marketing literature on products and services, notifying you of events, and providing you with information about NCR. You may always change your privacy preferences as set forth below. From time to time, NCR may co-brand an offering or a communication with a third party, which may also collect your Personal Information or with whom we may share it.  In such cases, the use of your Personal Information by such third parties is covered by their respective privacy policies, and not this Privacy Policy. If those cases where you choose to forward a page to another individual (where such option is available), NCR may request certain Personal Information about that individual to complete your request, such as their name and e-mail address, but NCR will not make further use of such information.

**_Social Networking Tools._** If NCR uses social networking tools to provide information to you, your information will be governed by the terms of use and the privacy policy for the applicable social networking tool.

**_Fulfilling Business Transactions_**. NCR may use your Personal Information to fulfill business transaction requests with you or your organization.  With respect to our customers, such requests may include, but are not limited to, providing products or services, such as delivering notifications of product fixes and updates, or contacting you in response to your questions, comments, or requests. With respect to our suppliers, such requests may include issuing purchase orders, receiving invoices, or providing other information such as forecasts.  If, in providing support (including support to assist you with the use of our website), we engage you telephonically through tools such as online chat, we may monitor or record our interaction for purposes of quality assurance, training, or to document the details of a transaction.

**_Recruitment._** If you seek employment with NCR, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may use this information throughout NCR in order to consider you for employment purposes, and may keep your information on file for future consideration and to support NCR’s compliance with applicable legal requirements.

#### Disclosure of Personal Information

We may share Personal Information (including Contract Data) within NCR and transfer it to countries around the world in which we operate in connection with the uses described in this Privacy Policy and in accordance with its terms.

We may share Personal Information with third-party suppliers and service providers that help us Process Personal Information. It is NCR’s practice to enter into contracts with our suppliers and service providers that require them to handle your information in a manner consistent with NCR policy and applicable law.

NCR also may provide information that identifies you at an individual level to third-party business partners, such as resellers.  NCR does not, however, sell or rent such information to these third parties.

From time to time, NCR may contemplate entering into various business development activities which may include the sale, purchase, merger, or reorganization of one or more of its businesses.  These business development activities may require the disclosure of Personal Information to the prospective or actual purchaser(s). When such disclosures are required, NCR will seek appropriate protections of your Personal Information.

In certain circumstances, NCR may use or release Personal Information to third parties when disclosure is required by law (e.g. statute, judicial proceeding, court order, or subpoena). We also reserve our right to use or provide your Personal Information to third parties, including law enforcement, auditors, consultants, and government officials, to protect NCR’s rights or property, and/or the rights or property of our customers, business partners, suppliers, or other third parties.

#### Setting Your Privacy Preferences and Opting Out

We will provide mechanisms for opting out of mass marketing communications directed to you. In addition, you may indicate to us that you no longer wish to receive emailed marketing communications from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the email communications we may provide to you, and you may always **contact us** directly as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

#### Accessing and Maintaining the Accuracy of Your Personal Information

NCR strives to maintain the accuracy of any Personal Information we collect, and we provide several mechanisms to allow you to review and request correction or deletion of Personal Information related to you where it is inaccurate (except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy, or where the rights of other persons would be violated).  We may, however, take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access to your Personal Information.  With respect to Contract Data, the NCR customer is responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the Personal Information it collects about you.

You may use the contact mechanisms specified **below** to request that we update, correct, or delete your Personal Information on file with us (subject to the limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph). Requests to access, correct, or delete Personal Information controlled by third parties (such as Contract Data) must be made through that third party.
