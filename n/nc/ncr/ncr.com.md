# NCR Privacy Policy

**NCR’s Policy on Privacy and Data Protection**

NCR is committed to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information you entrust to us, as well as information to which we must have access in order to provide products and services to our customers (in this policy, “you” includes any person about whom NCR collects or possesses Personal Information). NCR takes appropriate steps to safeguard this information in accordance with the applicable laws of the countries in which we conduct business as well as with contractual requirements.

In keeping with this commitment, we created this privacy policy to help you understand how NCR will protect Personal Information. NCR complies with data protection principles applicable in the major jurisdictions in which we operate. These principles require that Personal Information:

  * Will be used fairly and lawfully. In particular, Personal Information will only be used in accordance with NCR’s privacy policies and procedures.
  * Will be obtained only for specified and lawful purposes, and will not be further used in any manner incompatible with those purposes.
  * Will be relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which it is used.
  * Will be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date.
  * Will not be kept for longer than is necessary for the specified purposes or as otherwise required by law.
  * Will be used in accordance with your rights as required by applicable legislation.
  * Will be subject to appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent accidental, unauthorized, or unlawful processing, disclosure or loss.
  * Will not be transferred without adequate protection.



“Use” of Personal Information as described in this policy includes all processing of that Information as defined in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament. If you are an NCR customer, employee, contractor, or supplier, the treatment of Personal Information may be subject to additional NCR policies, or to a contract between us.

This policy was last updated on August 1, 2008.

**Policy Statement**

**Personal Information defined**  
Personal Information may include a person’s name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, gender, social security number or equivalent, and photograph, and may also include information concerning a person’s education, employment, interests, or any other information necessary to complete a requested transaction or service (such as credit card or other credit information).

You may provide Personal Information to NCR in a variety of ways, such as registering for an on-line account or event, joining a mailing list, or filling out an information form. Additionally, we may obtain Personal Information from other sources like call centers, product registration or third parties. We may also obtain Personal Information about our customers’ customers in the course of providing our products or services.

**To what does this Privacy Policy apply?**  
This policy applies to any Personal Information that NCR has in its possession or control regardless of how or where that information was obtained, or where it is stored or used. All NCR organizations and personnel worldwide are governed by this policy.

**Collection & Use of Personal Information**  
We collect only Personal Information which is necessary or helpful for valid business purposes or to comply with applicable law, and any such Information will be obtained only by fair and lawful means.

We will use Personal Information only to the extent necessary to fulfill our business needs, and in any event in accordance with applicable data protection legislation. Such use may include sales calls, marketing communications, delivering or completing requested services or transactions, and analyzing a series of transactions. We will only use Personal Information about our customers’ customers in accordance with our customer’s instructions, and again only in compliance with applicable law.

Some NCR web sites utilize cookies to collect information. A cookie is a small element of data that a web site can send to a web browser, which is then stored on the browser user’s computer. Information stored in a cookie may include, among other things, access times, the NCR or linked sites visited, IP address, and domain name. This cookie data helps us determine how many people visit the site, where they are from and what pages they view. This information, together with data stored in server logs, may be used to track trends in NCR’s site traffic to help us improve the site.

**How long is Personal Information retained?**  
We will retain Personal Information as long as it is helpful in supporting the overall purpose(s) for which the information was provided, consistent with applicable law.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**  
We may disclose Personal Information to our subsidiaries and related companies, and to certain third parties, including service providers or subcontractors necessary to support the uses described above, but such disclosure will always be consistent with the purposes for which the Information was provided. When we transmit Personal Information to a third party, we contractually require that party to employ appropriate safeguards in connection with its use of the information, and to use it only for the purposes we state. In some instances, data may be transferred outside the country in which it was gathered, but we will not do so without assuring that suitable safeguards are in place. We may also release Personal Information to third parties when disclosure is required by law.

We will not sell, rent or lease Personal Information to third parties, except in conjunction with a sale of our business to which the Personal Information relates.

**Setting your privacy preferences and opting out**  
We will provide mechanisms for opting out of mass marketing communications targeted by Personal Information we have collected. These mechanisms will normally be available on the relevant web site, but you may always use the contact mechanism specified below. Requests to opt out of communications based on data controlled by third parties must be made through the third party.

**Accessing and maintaining the accuracy of your Personal Information**  
We strive to maintain the accuracy of any Personal Information we collect. We will provide mechanisms to allow you to review, correct, or delete (except where retention is necessary to complete a requested transaction or service, or to meet legal requirements) Personal Information related to you. These mechanisms will normally be available on the relevant Web site, but you may always use the contact mechanism specified below. Requests to access, correct, or delete Personal Information controlled by third parties must be made through that third party. 

**Protection of your Personal Information**  
We will take appropriate steps to safeguard Personal Information to reduce the risk of its disclosure or use in violation of this policy.

**Notification of changes to this policy**  
We are always working to improve our business methods and policies. As a result, this policy may be updated or amended. If we substantially change it, we will post a notice on this site for at least 30 days, describing the change, and we will revise the "last updated" date above to reflect the change.
