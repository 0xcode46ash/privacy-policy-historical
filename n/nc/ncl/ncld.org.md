# NCLD - Privacy Policy

  
Here at NCLD your privacy is extremely important to us. We want to make your experience on the Internet as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and we want you to view our site as a source you can trust. We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and security. This Privacy Policy describes how NCLD collects information from all end users of our organization sites, including [www.ld.org](http://www.ld.org/); [www.getreadytoread.org](http://www.getreadytoread.org/); and [www.recognitionandresponse.org](http://www.recognitionandresponse.org/).  NCLD requests that you read this Privacy Policy carefully. 

**How NCLD Collects and Uses Visitor Information  
**NCLD collects information in different ways from visitors who access our sites. We use this information to help us provide you with important, relevant and timely information. NCLD uses vendors in the collection of visitor information, but our data is held privately and we do not share information with any third party. We also utilize e-mails collected via the sites to provide you with newsletters, advocacy and fundraising information. You will receive an e-mail confirming that you wish to receive this information. Should you not wish to receive it, do not respond to the e-mail. 

**Registration**   
Visitors are asked to provide certain personal information when they join our community or subscribe to our newsletter(s), such as name, address, telephone number, and e-mail. The information collected from visitors during the registration process is used to help NCLD develop better content for the Web sites, collect audience information and to develop our Web community, particularly for advocacy and fundraising purposes. This information is not shared with third parties. 

**Online Shopping**   
NCLD offers products through an online store; we choose products that we believe are of high quality and could be of value to parents, professionals, or individuals with learning disabilities.  However, please use your own discretion in choosing products that best meet your needs. 

At some Web sites linked to by our sites, you can purchase products and services or register to receive materials, such as a catalog or new product and service updates. In many cases, you may be asked to provide contact information, such as your name, address, email address, phone number, and credit/debit card information. If you complete an order for someone else, such as an online gift order sent directly to a recipient, you may be asked to provide information about the recipient, such as the recipient's name, address, and phone number. NCLD has no control over the third parties' use of any personal information you provide when placing such an order. Please exercise care when doing so. 

**Responses to Email Inquiries**   
When visitors send email inquiries to our sites, they will receive an automatic response and an e-mail allowing them to sign up for our newsletters and other e-bulletins. Due to the heavy volume of inquiries, it is not possible for NCLD to respond to every individual e-mail. Visitors are encouraged to browse the site for answers to their questions, and the auto response explains and links to specific site sections. There is also an additional e-mail contact, in case the automatic response and Web guidance does not provide the needed information. NCLD does not share the return email address with any third party. 

  **Disclaimer**   
Please note: The contents of NCLD's Web sites are intended for informational use only and do not necessarily reflect the views of NCLD, its officers, or directors. 

Information contained on these pages is intended to increase understanding of learning disabilities and provide high quality resources to parents, professionals and individuals with LD. While it does not recommend or endorse specific products or programs, it does advocate for responsible decision-making and in certain instances will promote activities that have proved effective in addressing the needs of individuals with LD. 

**Voluntary Customer Surveys**   
We may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services, programs and content we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if the survey is conducted by a third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our surveys and combine (or aggregate) it with the responses of other visitors to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of our services and information to you, and to develop new services and products. 

**"Cookies" and How NCLD Uses Them**   
A "cookie" is a small data file that can be placed on your hard drive when you visit certain Web sites. NCLD may use cookies only to collect, store, and sometimes track information for statistical purposes to improve the information and services we provide and to manage our telecommunications networks. These cookies do not enable third parties to access any of your customer information. 

Advertisers, linked sites, and partners may also use their own cookies. We do not control use of these cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them. 

**NCLD's Commitment to Children's Privacy**   
Protecting children's privacy is especially important to us. We have Web pages designed especially for our younger users. While we make every effort to ensure that these Web sites are fun and age-appropriate for our younger audience, we believe that there is no substitute for proper parental supervision. For further information about tips, tools, age-appropriate or kid-friendly Web sites and how to report online trouble, please visit [Getnetwise.org](http://www.getnetwise.org/ "getnetwise.org").  Finally, NCLD recommends that children ask a parent for permission before sending personal information to NCLD or to anyone else online. 

**Public Forums**   
Please remember that any information you may disclose in our other public areas, such as a bulletin board, of our Web sites or the Internet, becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in these public areas. 

**NCLD's Commitment to Data Security**   
Services and Web sites we sponsor have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining this information.
