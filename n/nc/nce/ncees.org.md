# NCEES: Privacy statement

By using the NCEES Web site, you signify your assent to the National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying terms-of-use agreement and privacy policy. If you do not agree with this privacy policy and/or our terms of use without limitation or qualification, or if use of this site is not permitted in your state or country, you may not use this Web site. Your continued use of the NCEES® Web site following any changes made to this privacy policy and/or our terms of use will mean that you also accept the changes.

The National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES) is committed to not disclosing your personal information to third parties without your consent, subject to the limited circumstances described below. 

Please read the following privacy policy to understand how we collect, use, and protect your personal information (information that personally identifies you as more fully defined in the terms of use agreement and supplemented herein).

##  **User choice regarding collection, use, and distribution of personal information  **

You may choose not to provide us with any personal information and must do so if any applicable law of your state or country so requires. In such event, although you will be able to observe the NCEES Web site, you will not be able to use and access those portions of the site that require your personal information. 

## **What information we know about you and how we use it**

If you register an account at the NCEES Web site, you will be asked to provide certain personal information, like your name, postal address, e-mail address, or phone number. In addition, depending upon the type of account you set up or service you request from NCEES, you may be asked certain additional personal information like your Social Security number, gender, birthplace, date of birth, country of citizenship, educational history, and certain financial information. Other personal information may be generated automatically as you use the NCEES Web site—for example, a history of postings, messages, and pages visited. 

## **Disclosure of information to third parties**

We will not disclose any of this personal information unless you authorize us to do so, except in connection with the services provided via the NCEES Web site or as otherwise provided in this privacy policy. NCEES does not rent or sell personal information to third parties. The information is provided to lawful authorities, such as licensing boards, for lawful compliance purposes, and it may be retained indefinitely or for so long as NCEES in its discretion or applicable law or regulation may require.

##  **Financial information**

We process credit card transactions via industry standard encryption through third-party processors, which processors only use your financial information for that purpose. Financial information is considered extremely private information and will not be shared by us with third parties except with your authorization and as necessary to carry out orders placed by you with the understanding by you that such transaction(s) may be subject to the rules and policies of such third party processor. 

## **When we may be forced to disclose**

We may disclose personal information of site visitors when necessary to comply with a court order or legal process, or where required by law, or to enforce the terms of use agreement or this privacy policy. This may occur, for example, when we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing (either intentionally or unintentionally) injury to or interference with our rights or property, or the rights or property of our site visitors or others. We also may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that the law, legal process, or a lawful investigation requires it.

##  **Security**

The importance of security is a top priority for us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your Internet connection to our servers. We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. We also take great care to protect personal information off-line. All of your data is handled only by authorized personnel, and our database servers have a backup system to prevent loss of data. 

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100 percent secure. Therefore, we will not be liable should a third-party illegally obtain your personal information. While we have made a great effort to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

##  **Data from children**

This site is neither directed toward nor intended for children. We do not knowingly collect data from children. 

## **Other limits to your privacy**

NCEES is not responsible for links to other Web sites or for the activities or content of other Web sites, or the agencies or entities specifically identified on the site to which or whom your personal information may be transmitted or sent as a result of your actions in using this site. 

## **Periodic changes to this policy  **

We may update, change or modify this privacy policy at any time and without notice. If we make substantial changes to this privacy policy, we will post the updated policy on this page and we will post notice that this privacy policy has changed on the NCEES homepage. Once any changes that we make to this privacy policy become effective, your continued use of this Web site after such time will signify your acceptance of the new terms. We therefore recommend that you refer to our privacy policy regularly. Changes will be effective upon posting on this Web site.
