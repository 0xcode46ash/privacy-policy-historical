## Privacy Statement

Northcentral University is committed to protecting your privacy, developing technology that gives you a powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to Northcentral’s Web sites, and governs data collection and use at all Northcentral sites and services. Please read the complete Statement of Privacy to learn additional details about how some of these sites and services protect your personal information. 

**Collection of your Personal Information  
** At some sites, Northcentral University collects personally identifiable information, such as your email address, name, home or work addresses, or telephone numbers. At other sites, anonymous demographic information is collected that is not unique to you, such as ZIP Codes, age and gender. Some sites collect a combination of the two types of information.   
Northcentral automatically collects information about your computer hardware and software, as do other Internet entities.

Northcentral University keeps track of visits to the Northcentral Web sites and pages in order to deliver customized content, and gauge the popularity and efficacy of sites, sections and services.   
Northcentral does not sell, rent, lease or lend its lead, applicant, Learner, or Mentor lists to third parties.

All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information, except to provide such services to Northcentral, and are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.

**Use of Cookies and Web Beacons**   
A "cookie" is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.   
The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page, which helps Northcentral recall your specific information on subsequent visits.   
A "Web beacon" is typically a small transparent graphic image that works with cookies to count and recognize users, and track movement from point to point within a server network.   
Northcentral Web sites use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. When you return to the same Northcentral Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved so that you can easily use the features that you customized.   
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Northcentral services or Web sites you visit. 

**Control your Personal Information**   
Northcentral offers its Learners choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may go to the Profile page to proactively make choices about the use and sharing of your personal information.

  **Security of your Personal Information**   
Northcentral secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Northcentral University secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled environment protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites through the use of encrypted Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protection.
