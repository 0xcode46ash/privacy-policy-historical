# Privacy

The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) values our visitors' private information and understands the need for security and trust surrounding such information. The following policy outlines the ways in which we collect, store and use personally identifiable information in providing our products and services. Except for very limited exceptions further described in the remainder of this Privacy Policy, we do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties.

## **Information Collection and Use**

DAAD is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. DAAD collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our website.

## **Events**

We request information from the user on our event sign-up form. Here a user must provide personally identifiable information (such as name and physical and/or email address). If an event is cancelled or re-scheduled, this personally identifiable information may be used to get in touch with the user.

## **Log Files**

We may use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

## **Sharing**

We share certain personally identifiable information obtained from our Events sign-up form with those who attend the event in question.

**Protection of Underage Persons**

Persons under the age of 13 may not submit data to us without the permission of their parents or legal guardians. We do not request personal data from minors. We do not knowingly collect such data and do not forward it to third parties.

## **Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process served DAAD.

## **Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [DAAD] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the DAAD website.

## **Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for personally identifiable information such as name and email address.

## **Communications from the Site**

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, when you sign up for an event or our electronic newsletters, we may store information that we collect through log files and other technologies.

## **Security**

This website takes every commercially reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit personally identifiable information via the website, we take reasonable precautions to protect user-information both online and off-line. When our event sign up form asks users to enter personally identifiable information, that information is sent via an encrypted channel using the secure sockets layer protocol (SSL).

While we use the SSL protocol to protect personally identifiable information online, we also take reasonable precautions to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the personally identifiable information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [daadny@daad.org](mailto:daadny@daad.org).

## **Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
