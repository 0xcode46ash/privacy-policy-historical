**Daptiv Inc. Privacy Policy**

Daptiv, Inc. (" **Daptiv** ") created this privacy Policy (the " **Policy** ") in order to demonstrate Daptiv’s commitment to the privacy of its customers. Privacy on the Daptiv website (the " **Site** ") and the online project management application (the " **Daptiv Offering** ") is of great importance to Daptiv. Because data is collected from our visitors of the Site and end users of the Daptiv Offering (the " **Subscribers** "), Daptiv has established this Policy to communicate Daptiv’s information gathering policies and dissemination practices. In this Policy, Daptiv discloses what information is gathered, what Daptiv does with it and how Daptiv protects your privacy.

**Acceptance.**

By visiting the Site or using the Daptiv Offering, you agree to the terms of this Policy. If at any time you believe that Daptiv has not adhered to the Policy, please contact Daptiv, and Daptiv will promptly review your inquiry. This Policy is for the Site and the Daptiv Offering only and does not apply to any third party links from the Site or third party software included in the Daptiv Offering.

**Collected Information.**

By using or accessing the Site or Daptiv Offering, you may be asked to provide Daptiv certain information, categorized in this Policy as either "Personal Information" or "Public Information."

**"Personal Information"** is any information that can identify you personally or otherwise reveal your own, personal characteristics or unique data, such as your name, birth date, home address or credit card information. Daptiv will use Personal Information only in the manner described in this Policy or as otherwise expressly authorized by you. In all cases, Daptiv will protect your Personal Information from unauthorized disclosure in the same manner it would Daptiv’s own, highly confidential information.

**"Public Information"** is any information that cannot be linked to you personally, such as aggregate Site user statistics or information regarding your Internet connectivity. Public Information will be gathered and used only to help improve internal processes, products, connectivity and monitor general usage.

**Content.**

Subscribers designate individual end users who are authorized to access and use their particular version of the Daptiv Offering, or “ **Subscriber Account** ”. These individuals are referred to as " **Authorized Users**." All information that is placed into the Daptiv Offering (by either Subscriber or Authorized Users) is referred to as " **Content** " whether such information is Personal Information or Public Information.

Subscriber Accounts are not public. Permission to view, access or use Content within the Subscriber Account is provided solely by Subscriber.

Each Subscriber Account is password protected. Daptiv will never ask for passwords in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Subscribers and their Authorized Users are responsible for protecting the secrecy of passwords and any Subscriber Account log-in information.

Authorized Users may upload and store Content in Subscriber Account in the manner designated by Subscriber. Daptiv will not use, view, manipulate, alter or seek to discover any information or data within Content or otherwise monitor the nature or quality of Content.

Daptiv may access, remove, segregate or quarantine Content (or a portion of Content) without prior notice or consent in the unlikely event such action: (a) is required by law; or (b) will prevent or mitigate damages caused by viral code, spyware, malware or other potentially harmful, unlawful or unauthorized materials contained within Content.

**Security.**

Daptiv protects your Content using state-of the-art technologies and a secure physical environment. The Site and Daptiv Offering are monitored 24x7 to ensure the Daptiv infrastructure is not accessed or used by unauthorized parties.

Secure Socket Layer (“ **SSL** ”) encrypted communication is available for use for all Content in Daptiv Offering. SSL is a standard format for transmitting secure Content from your computer to an Daptiv server. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt Content that's transferred over the SSL connection. You will know SSL is being used when you see preceding a web address with “https” rather than “http.”

**Use of Cookies.**

The Site and Daptiv Offering may use cookies. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your computer by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. A cookie may be sent by Daptiv to your browser and potentially stored on your computer system. Your browser returns cookie information to the domain where it originated (in this case, the Daptiv Offering).

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to enhance the performance of online applications and save you time. The cookie tells the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. This improves the usability of the application by reducing the number of trips to the server.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept or decline it. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not have access to all of the Daptiv Offering interactive features and/or experience reduced performance.

**E-Mail Communications**

Daptiv communicates with Authorized Users occasionally about new product features, promotions or offers from Daptiv. You may opt-out of certain communications, such as these, by following the instructions included in each communication (e.g. following the unsubscribe instructions within the e-mail).

**Changes to this Privacy Policy.**

Daptiv continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect your Content, your privacy and your use of Daptiv products and services. As a result, changes to this Policy may be made by Daptiv from time to time. In no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect your Content from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Policy. To the extent Daptiv changes any policies related to its use of Personal Information, Daptiv will provide you with at least thirty (30) days prior notice via e-mail. You will be given the option of “opting out” of these changes, but such choice may impact your ability to use all or part of the Site or Daptiv Offering.
