Daptiv also uses cookies to understand traffic patterns on the Site and to authorize access to certain content and product features of the Daptiv Offerings. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to enhance the performance of online applications and save you time. For instance, a cookie tells the Web server that you have returned to a specific page.

**NO ERROR FREE PERFORMANCE**

Daptiv may release alpha and beta versions of the Daptiv Offerings, which are further refined before the release of the final version. Because these products are still in a test phase, Daptiv may not always catch an unintended privacy issue, despite our efforts to do so. As such, Daptiv welcomes feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. Daptiv does not guarantee error-free performance under this Policy. Daptiv will use reasonable efforts to comply with this Policy and will take prompt corrective action upon learning of any failure to comply with this Policy.
