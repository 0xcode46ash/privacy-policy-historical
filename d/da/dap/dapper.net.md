The fields for compulsory completion will be explicitly indicated. If you do not enter the requisite data in these fields, you will be unable to register with Dapper. 

We may collect further information when you use Dapper. For example, we may record the frequency and scope of your use of Dapper, the duration of your sessions, Dapps that you use or create, advertisement that you click on, the Internet protocol (IP) address that serves you to access Dapper and the geographic location from where you logged-in.

However, in some instances we may have to store your username and password. For example, when you create an alert based on a Dapp we must periodically check the content related to your Dapp, without your intervention. In such cases, we will take measures to protect the information in order to minimize the risk of its exposure to unauthorized third parties.
