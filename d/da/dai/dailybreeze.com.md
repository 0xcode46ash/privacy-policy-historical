DailyBreeze.com is committed to protecting your right to privacy. These are the policies DailyBreeze.com adheres to in maintaining this site for your use.

  1. We will explicitly ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you ("Personal Information"). Generally, Personal Information is requested when you seek a particular service or information from us or one of our partners.
  2. We maintain business relationships with certain third-party service partners ("Service Partners"). These Service Partners allow us to offer you a broader array of services than we could not provide to you on our own and assist us in the operation of our site. We and our Service Partners may use your Personal Information to operate the site and services that we offer.
  3. We do not believe that any portion of our site directly solicits children 13 years old or younger. However, if we develop a portion of our site that does directly solicit children age 13 years old or younger, we will not directly solicit Personal Information from children, nor provide it for Other Companies' Use without first obtaining the consent of a parent or guardian.
  4. We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates. (b) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users. (c) act as immediately necessary in order to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.
  5. DailyBreeze.com expects its business partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users.

You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.
  6. While on our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookie technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. Some cookies enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular ad before. 

Features available through our site may offer services operated by third parties and may use cookies or other technology to gather information. DailyBreeze.com does not control the use of this technology by third parties or the resulting information, and is not responsible.

 **Violation of Daily Breeze copyright**  
The Daily Breeze and its websites have always taken copyright issues seriously, both as creators of content and as users of other people s content. In fact, everything that appears in a typical edition or on our website is copyright protected. Nonetheless, our work is illegally reproduced every day on websites across the country and around the world.  
The federal Copyright Act protects our rights and our readers rights to make fair use of copyrighted content. The law allows people to quote a small amount of a copyrighted story so as to be able to comment on it, perhaps even to criticize us. That s the essence of free speech in a vigorous democracy.  
But fair use of our content means reproducing a couple of paragraphs or a summary of a story and then providing a web link to the entire work on our website. It does not entitle someone to appropriate and display most or all of a story, photograph or graphic on his or her website. To do so is a violation of our copyright and we will use all legal remedies available to address these copyright infringements. We understand people want to share what they find interesting in our publications and on our websites and we encourage all to do so. This is a reminder that there is a correct and legal way to do that.  
With your continued support and compliance with the law, we will remain a vital and trusted source for unique and unduplicated content affecting you and our community.
