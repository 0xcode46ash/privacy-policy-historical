# DailyLit: Read books by email and RSS.

We take the privacy of your personal information very seriously. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site and/or register to for the DailyLit services. Please read this policy carefully.

### Your E-mail Address

In order to send you books by email, we need your e-mail address (duh). We do not require any other personal information. We may occasionally send you e-mails that are not part of a book, for instance, to notify you of changes to DailyLit or to suggest other books you might enjoy.

DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your e-mail address with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

We currently process the sending of DailyLit emails ourselves, but in the future might use a third party e-mail provider, in which case we need to share your e-mail address with that provider, but exclusively for the purpose of delivering our e-mail.

We may also disclose your e-mail address as required by law.

To remove your e-mail address from DailyLit, simply click on the "manage all your subscriptions" link included in every email. You will see a list of your subscriptions and an option to remove your email address.

### Usage Information and Optional Personal Information

DailyLit keeps track of your subscriptions, including which books you are reading and how far along you are with these. We may also ask you for optional personal information, such as your name, your age, and so on.

DailyLit will never sell, rent or share your usage and optional personal information, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

We may use this information to improve DailyLit, customize your experience, show you more relevant ads, suggest books to read, etc.

We may also share this information in anonymous, aggregate form. Anonymous means without your e-mail address or any other information that personally identifies you. Aggregate means added, averaged or otherwise combined across a number of users so as to prevent identification of individual users.

We may also disclose this information as required by law.

### Review and Access

Upon your request, we will provide you with a representation of the information we have currently stored about you. You will have an opportunity to correct or delete this information within the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### Cookies

Like most sites, DailyLit makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard disk by our server. They allow us to better customize our site and to store preference information (e.g., at what time of the day you like to receive your DailyLit e-mail). DailyLit will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or services.

### Links to Other Sites

As part of the service, DailyLit may create links allowing you to access third party sites. DailyLit is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not endorse these sites. Please consult those sites' individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

DailyLit may update this policy at any time for any reason. If there are any material changes to how we handle personal information we will send a notice to your email address and/or temporarily place a prominent notice on our Web site.
