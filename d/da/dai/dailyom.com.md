**How We Use User Information**  
Our site uses a registration form to request information (email address, email type preference, country and zip code) in order to subscribe to receive the free DailyOM email. DailyOM will not share your personal information with any third party without your express consent. We also request additional demographic information (gender, birthdate), which is optional. We use this information to create a better user experience and evaluate which DailyOMs should be featured. Additionally, we may share this demographic information (including country and zip code) with others including potential advertisers in an anonymous report. This demographic information will presented in a purely anonymous, aggregated manner that has no personal information attached to it. All information provided in the _Email This To A Friend_ utility is used solely for purposes of generating one-time private emails that are sent under your email address to those parties you have designated, and no information will be stored or shared with any third party. You may, from time to time, receive information from us about new features, new services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. You may opt out of receiving future mailings from DailyOM by [unsubscribing](http://www.dailyom.com/cgi-bin/userinfo/settings.cgi?unsubscribe=1). 

**Sale of Our Company**  
As a natural consequence of the development of our company, we could be sold to another company. In the event that we are acquired by another company or a significant portion of our assets is sold to another company, all of the customer information may be transferred to the new company.

All personal information is stored on restricted database servers. We use industry standard measures to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of your information once it is in our care.
