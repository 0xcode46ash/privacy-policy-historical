## **Purpose of this Privacy Policy**

This privacy policy describes how Hearst Holdings, Inc., King Features Syndicate Division and its affiliates treat the personally identifiable information that is collected about you when you visit the Web sites, mobile-optimized versions of the Web sites, and digital applications to which this policy is linked. For purposes of this policy, Hearst Holdings Inc., King Features Syndicate Division and its affiliates are referred to collectively as " **King Features** ".

## **What is Personally Identifiable Information** ****

"Personally identifiable information" is information that we can use to identify you as an individual. Personally identifiable information includes your name, address, telephone number and any other information that is connected with you personally.

## **Information This Privacy Policy Does Not Apply To**

This privacy policy applies to the Web site, mobile-optimized versions of the Web site and digital application operating under the name " **DailyINK** " or " **DailyINK.com** " (and the underlying pages that operate under the primary URL "KingFeatures.com") to which this policy is linked. King Features is a division of Hearst Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary of Hearst Corporation; however, this policy does not apply to any other Web sites operated by or on behalf of Hearst Corporation or its affiliates and subsidiaries. Any information you provide when you a visit Web site other than that covered by this policy (including other Web sites affiliated with Hearst) is subject to the privacy policies posted on those Web sites. This policy also does not apply to information you may provide to us offline.

## **Collection of Personally Identifiable Information**

King Features endeavors to maintain the security and integrity of personal information that we obtain from our users. We do not disclose information to any outside party except as disclosed in this policy.

King Features collects personally identifiable information with your specific knowledge and consent. For instance, when you complete a survey, register for the site, make a purchase, enter a sweepstakes or contest, participate in our social networking features, and other electronic services you will be asked to provide information such as your e-mail address, name, phone number, and shipping address. Information such as your age, gender, hobbies or interests may also be requested. This information may sometimes be collected by third party service providers with whom King Features contracts to host the Web site or to fulfill requests for services; in that event, King Features asks such providers to make the personal information available only to King Features for King Features to use in accordance with the terms of this policy and not to use the information for any other purpose. King Features uses this information to provide you with the service you have requested. Similarly, if you enter online sweepstakes, we will use this information to notify you if you are a winner. We might also send out e-mails to users and sweepstakes/contest entrants to announce special offers, services and announcements from our sites and/or our advertisers. If you provide personal information for use in any of our social networking channels or tools (which may include services such as mail, friendships, instant messaging and the like), we will use that information in the manner contemplated by the particular networking channel. Please check each channel for a description of how networking is conducted.

## **Cookies**

King Features (or third party service providers on our behalf) may set and access cookies and similar technologies on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data (often including a unique identifier), that is sent to your browser from a Web site's computers and stored on your computer's or mobile device's hard drive or other memory storage device. Some of our cookies may be local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies. King Features uses cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our site.

We may use cookies to control the display of ads, to track usage patterns on the sites, to deliver editorial content, to record requests for subscriptions and to personalize information.

Our cookies may contain personally identifiable information and such cookies may be shared with others to the same extent indicated above.

King Features (or third party service providers on our behalf) may also use cookies to collect aggregate information about Web site users on an anonymous basis. We may share aggregate demographic and usage information with our prospective and actual business partners, advertisers and other third parties for any business purpose.

Some of our advertisers may serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

## **IP Address**

Your Internet Protocol ("IP") address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. Our server may also record the referring page that linked you to us (e.g., another Web site or a search engine); the pages you visit on our sites, the Web site you visit after this Web site; the ads you see; the ads you click on; other information about the type of Web browser, computer, platform, related software and settings you are using; any search terms you have entered on this Web site or a referral site; and other Web usage activity and data logged by our Web servers. We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers, gather broad demographic information, and administer our Web site. We may also link this information with your personal information when we feel that it is necessary to enforce compliance with our rules and policies or terms of service or to protect our Sites, customers or others.

We may use cookies or "clear GIFs" (aka "Web beacons" or "pixel tags") or similar technologies, in the sites and in our communications with you to enable us to know whether you have visited a Web page or received a message. A clear GIF is typically a one-pixel, transparent image (although it can be a visible image as well), located on a Web page or in an e-mail or other type of message, which is retrieved from a remote site on the Internet enabling the verification of an individual's viewing or receipt of a Web page or message. A clear gif may enable us to relate your viewing or receipt of a Web page or message to other information about you, including your personal information.

## **Co-branding and special services**

Some of our sites may from time to time partner with a retailer or other third party to offer online shopping opportunities, games, services, subscriptions and other applications on a co-branded or cross-promotional basis. Those transactions may take place on a King Features site, or the site of the third party. In either case, personal information you provide in connection with the transaction may be shared with the third party, as well as with any participating sponsors or advertisers of such opportunities and features. Some of our sites may offer you the ability to access a third-party site with whom we have a relationship to access both sites through a co-branded registration or password; in that event, your applicable registration information may be shared with the third-party partner and used by them in accordance with their own privacy policy. We will notify you at the applicable point of sign up if any such co-branded registration or password practices will be in effect.

Some of our applications and mobile-optimized sites may have location-based features. For those features, we will collect your geographic location and, depending on the application, other information you provide us to enable you to enjoy the service being offered. For example, we may offer shopping features that allows you to get information about local merchants or travel features that allows you to locate nearby sights and destinations. We will use your location to serve relevant content, and your information may be shared with third party retailers and other facilities as applicable to allow you to take advantage of the particular service being offered.

## **Disclosure of Information**

In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your personal information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you of that development. If a notification is appropriate, we would endeavor to do so as promptly as possible under the circumstances, and, to the extent we have your e-mail address, we may notify you by e-mail.

In addition to the foregoing, King Features may share or disclose personally identifiable information about you to other companies or individuals when:

  * we utilize third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on our behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions), and ask these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information and not to use your personally identifiable information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which we hired them;
  * you have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use in their discretion, including direct marketing (Some of our contests and sweeps will ask you at the time of entry whether you would like your personal information to be shared with the sponsor. Other contests will not give you that option and in that event, if you do not want your information to be shared, you should not enter the contest);
  * you have furnished us personal information with the intent that it be forwarded to a third party for use in connection with a specified service you are electing to participate in (examples include, without limitation, e-commerce partners, services to help old friends locate you online, etc.);
  * we need to protect our legal rights (for example, if we are trying to collect money you owe us);
  * we must comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal or regulatory process;
  * we have reason to believe that someone may be causing injury to someone or interfering with our rights or the rights of our users, or general public, or using our services in violation of a legal or personal right; or
  * in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (whether of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Web sites to which this policy applies.
