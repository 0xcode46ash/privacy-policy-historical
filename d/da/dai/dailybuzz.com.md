# Privacy Policy | Federated Media

**This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 05, 2012.**  
At Federated Media Publishing (“FM”), we own and operate certain websites (the “FM Properties”); we represent online publishers (“Publishers”) and their properties (“Publisher Properties”) to advertisers; and we support other properties sponsored by advertiser clients (“Client-Sponsored Properties”). Because we understand the importance of your privacy, we take safeguarding your personal information very seriously. We are providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of the personally identifiable and anonymous information collected from you during your use of any FM website or service whether from (i) an FM Property; (ii) a Client-Sponsored Property or other website on federatedmedia.net (the “FM Domain”) or (iii) a Client-Sponsored Property on a different domain (each of the above is, individually, a “Site” and, collectively, our “Sites”). You’ll know you’re on one of our Sites because a version of this Privacy Policy will be posted. This Privacy Policy does not apply to Publisher Properties. You should review the Privacy Policy at any Publisher Property site to understand that site’s practices with regards to the collection and use of personally identifiable information.

Federated Media reserves the right to update or change this Privacy Policy from time to time for any reason, and such changes will be effectively immediately upon posting to this or another Site. We will notify you of any material changes by posting the new policy on each Site and highlighting the changes. We suggest that you consult the Sites regularly to check for any changes to this Privacy Policy. Under certain circumstances (for example, in connection with certain material changes, including changes to our online behavioral data collection and use policies), we may also elect to notify you of changes or updates to our Privacy Policy, or request your consent for such changes, by additional means, such as posting a notice on the Web site to sending you an email. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at privacypolicy@federatedmedia.net.

**Information We Collect**  
We collect information in connection with our Sites and Services in the following circumstances, though not every one of our Sites offers each of these four: (i) registering for an account, (ii) participation in surveys, sweepstakes, contests, and promotions (“Surveys and Promotions”), (iii) contacting FM, and (iv) visiting and browsing any of our Sites and our Publisher Properties. You may choose not to provide us with certain information, but this may limit the services we are able to provide you.

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
We call information you provide that can be used to locate or identify you “Personally Identifiable Information.” We use Personally Identifiable Information to provide our Services to you and to communicate with you regarding such Services.

**We collect Personally Identifiable Information in the following ways:**  
**a. Registration**  
If you register for FM services as an Advertiser or Reader, we collect information during the registration process. That may include your name, company name, company address, phone number, username, email address, date of birth, and account password. We may also collect your IP address when you register and use the Site. Note that, as an Advertiser, you must register on the FM Domain in order to become an FM advertiser for the Publisher Properties. Readers: From time to time we may offer additional features, services, and promotional opportunities that may require you to submit additional information to participate.  
**b. Surveys and Promotions**  
Readers: We collect certain information about you and your web browsing sessions if you participate in Surveys and Promotions, which allows FM to coordinate the marketing support that allows FM and its Publishers to continue to share their knowledge, insights, and opinions. Participation in Surveys and Promotions is optional. Should you choose to participate, the information we collect for Surveys and Promotions may include your name, phone number, address, e-mail address, IP address, the website from which you came to the applicable Site, travel preferences, favorite websites, family profile, age, whether you are a U.S. resident, and employment profile.  
**c. Contacting FM**  
You may contact FM by filling out and submitting a form through a Site, or by submitting feedback when you are logged in to a Site. When you contact FM through a Site, your full name and email address are transmitted to FM. Any other information you choose to include in the form you submit would also be transferred to and stored on FM’s servers.

**Anonymous Information**  
We collect Anonymous Information on our Sites and our Publisher Properties through small text files called “cookies.” We use both session Cookies (which expire when you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). These cookies track usage patterns and browsing patterns on FM Sites and our Publisher Properties. We also collect information such as traffic statistics, general usage patterns regarding page views, dates and times Readers use the Site, the website that referred Readers to the Site, the method by which Readers access the Site, files accessed through the Site, responses sent to the browser, the length of data sent to the browser, and other data used in the communication between browser and Sites.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**  
We may use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide information you have requested or products you have purchased (e.g., membership updates, e-mail newsletters, advertising insertion orders), to resolve disputes, collect fees, and troubleshoot problems. We also may use your Personally Identifiable Information to respond to specific inquiries made by you; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use; and to customize, measure, and improve our Services, content, and layout. In addition, the FM Network may analyze and use your Personally Identifiable Information — and supplement it with other information we obtain — to notify you and target advertising to you regarding special offers, products, services, and information that we think may be of interest to you, and to measure the advertising effectiveness of advertisements on our Sites and Publisher Properties.

We use Anonymous Information to provide aggregate information across FM Sites and our Publisher Properties to improve our services. For Publishers, we collect information about content and traffic patterns on your pages to provide more relevant advertising. For Readers, we use your Anonymous Information for the purposes of system administration, providing certain site functionality and content, targeted advertising, site tracking, and collecting and reporting aggregate usage information. We use Cookies to collect information about the pages you view and the searches you make, to send targeted advertising to you. We may combine Anonymous Information with your personally identifiable information to notify you of special offers and target advertising and other content to you.

We also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the FM Sites and the Publisher Properties. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or “web beacons” (which are small, transparent graphic images) to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party and the advertiser. The FM Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.

Our collection of Anonymous Information is to help target and send advertisements relevant to you. In addition, third parties may send Cookie information through FM to further allow us to segment our audience and provide further services to you. We also may share Cookie information with parties that provide us with data and information (our “Trusted Third Parties”) to provide further targeted services to you.

**Behavioral Advertising Compliance Disclosure and Opting Out**  
Federated Media and/or our partners may use data collected on the FM Sites and our Publisher Properties to customize ads to you as you browse the Web. If you do not want your browsing behavior used for online behavioral advertising purposes, OPT-OUT of the collection of anonymous information from Federated Media and/or OPT-OUT of the collection of anonymous information from our Trusted Third Party partners.

**DAA Compliance Disclosure**  
Federated Media uses the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising managed by the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) (http://www.aboutads.info). As part of this service Federated Media’s online advertisements and Web sites are sometimes delivered with icons that help consumers understand how their data is being used and provide choice options to consumers that want more control.

**Data Retention**  
Unless you contact us to request the deletion of your Advertiser or Reader account, we will retain data for as long as it is necessary to fulfill a legitimate business purpose or as required by law.

**Phishing**  
We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your username, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. Identity theft and the practice currently known as “phishing” are of great concern to FM. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is our top priority. For more information about phishing, you may want to visit the [Federal Trade Commission’s website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/alerts/alt127.shtm).

**Information Sharing**  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties.

**Posting**  
Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards, web logs, and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If you post personal information that is accessible to the public online, you do so at your own risk. Be aware that you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

**Third Party Service Providers**  
We engage certain trusted third parties to perform various functions and provide services to us (for example, web hosting services and maintenance services). These third parties may have access to some of your Personally Identifiable Information, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your Personally Identifiable Information.

**Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement**  
We may choose to disclose some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to the government, law enforcement officials, or private parties if we, in our sole discretion, believe it necessary or appropriate to comply with the law, to respond to legal complaints, to comply with legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the rights of FM or a third party, to ensure the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally questionable activity.

**Changes in Corporate Ownership**  
If any or all of the assets of FM are acquired by, or merged with, another entity we will share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information with that entity.

**Accessing and Changing Your Information**  
You may always access and modify certain of your Personally Identifiable Information you provide through FM’s self-service e-commerce platform by visiting the “sign in” area at the FM Domain. You may or may not be able to modify the Personally Identifiable Information you provide through other parts of the FM Domain or other Sites. If this causes concern, please contact us at the e-mail address provided below and we will provide information for the specific Site you reference.

**Security**  
We place great importance on the safety and security of your Personally Identifiable Information. We employ certain physical, procedural, and technological measures in an attempt to protect your Personally Identifiable Information from unauthorized access and use. FM’s servers that contain Personally Identifiable Information are stored in an off-site facility. FM also uses hashed passwords, which allows an algorithmic version of your password to be stored instead of you actual password. When receiving financial information (e.g., PayPal account IDs) for completing certain online transactions, including those in connection with the FM self-service platform, our site uses SSL or “Secure Sockets Layer,” an industry standard security protocol, though other communications through the Sites are not encrypted. Although we do attempt to keep your Personally Identifiable Information secure, no security measures are perfect; there is always a possibility that a security breach could occur, resulting in the release of Personally Identifiable Information.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Each FM Site may contain links to other websites, including but not limited to Publisher Properties, in several places. You should pay particular attention to which website you are visiting when submitting any personally identifiable information to these websites. This Privacy Policy addresses the use and disclosure of only that information that we collect from you through our various Sites. Different rules may apply to information you submit to other websites including Publisher Properties, and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these websites.

**Our Policy Toward Children**  
None of our Sites are directed toward persons under eighteen years of age. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacypolicy@federatedmedia.net . If we become aware that a child under thirteen has provided us with personally identifiable information, we will remove such information from our files.
