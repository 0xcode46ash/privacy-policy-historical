# Privacy - Dainese

#### Privacy

Welcome to [www.dainese.com](http://www.dainese.com/) (hereinafter the “ **Website** ”). Please read our Privacy Policy carefully. It applies both if you should decide to simply browse the Website and use its services without purchasing any products, and if you should instead access the Website and decide to browse and use its services to purchase the products there offered up for sale. 

By using the Website, you accept the terms given in the Privacy Policy and the disclosure at the foot of the Privacy Policy. Please do not use the Website if you disagree with any of the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy. The Personal Data of the Website users and consumers (hereinafter jointly referred to as the " **Users** ") will be processed in Italy in compliance with applicable European legislation and with the Personal Data Protection Code (Italian Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003, hereinafter the " **Privacy Code** "), which governs personal data processing by anyone resident or with registered offices in Italy. 

In compliance with the Privacy Code, Triboo Digitale S.r.l., with registered office in Italy at Viale Sarca 336 - 20126 - Milano, VAT no. 02912880966 (hereinafter " **triboo digitale** ") and DAINESE S.p.A., with registered office in Italy at Via dell'Artigianato n. 35 - 36060 - Molvena (VI), registered with Vicenza Registrar of Companies under no. IT03924090248 (hereinafter " **DAINESE** ") are the data controllers of the Users' personal data, each respectively for the different services supplied in relation to the Website use. 

More specifically, Triboo Digitale is an independent data controller for the Users' data in respect of sales and after-sales activities carried out on-line via the Website, whilst DAINESE is the only, independent data controller for the Users' data in respect of generalised marketing activities and any profiling as may be carried out through the Website.

**1\. The policy  **

Everyone has the right to the protection of their Personal Data and Triboo Digitale and DAINESE respect the right of their Users to be informed with regards to the collection and other operations involved in the processing of their Personal Data. Processing of data that can directly or indirectly identify your person will be carried out only where strictly necessary. The Website has therefore been configured in such a way as to ensure that use of Personal Data has been minimised and to exclude processing of Personal Data when the purposes pursued in the individual cases can be achieved by using anonymous data (such as, for example, market research aimed at improving services) or carried out in other ways, which enable identification of the data subject only where strictly necessary or required by the authorities and police forces (such as, for example, for data relating to traffic and time spent on the Website or your IP address). 

This Privacy Policy provides all information you may need to better understand how we collect and use the information identifying Website Users. For additional information on our Privacy Policy, requests can be e-mailed to [dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com](mailto:dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com); or posted to the registered office of Triboo Digitale or DAINESE, as specified above. 

**2\. Who processes your personal data, how and why**

In accordance with the Privacy Code, Triboo Digitale is the data controller of the Personal Data pertaining to Website Users (hereinafter the " **Personal Data** "), aimed at the management, conclusion and fulfilment of commercial transactions involving the purchase of products via the website (hereinafter the " **Commercial Purposes** "): Triboo Digitale decides on the purposes and methods of this data processing and which instruments to be used, also as concerns security. Merely for purposes relating to its organisation and practicality, Triboo Digitale has appointed some external data supervisors to process the Personal Data, for reasons strictly connected and related to the provision of services on the Website, including the sale of products (merely by way of example, customer care services and dispatch of the products purchased). These supervisors have been chosen because they have proven to have the experience, capacity and reliability to provide a suitable guarantee of complete compliance with current provisions on processing, including as concerns data security. The supervisors will process the Personal Data in accordance with the instructions given by Triboo Digitale. We will perform regular checks to ensure that the supervisors have duly and promptly completed the tasks assigned them and that they continue to provide suitable guarantees of full compliance with provisions on personal data protection. The names and details of the Personal Data supervisors appointed by Triboo Digitale can be requested by e-mailing: [dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com](mailto:dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com).

In accordance with the Privacy Code, DAINESE is the data controller for the Personal Data pertaining to Website Users (hereinafter the " **Personal Data** "), aimed at direct marketing and profiling, according to the consent given by the data subject (hereinafter the " **Marketing Purposes** "); it uses the Personal Data in order to send newsletters relating to DAINESE and its products and for generalised and/or personalised promotional messages, according to the User's consumption habits. 

The Personal Data will be processed within their respective scopes of competence by persons in charge of processing, specifically chosen by Triboo Digitale and DAINESE. In these cases, the Personal Data will only be processed by persons in charge of processing who have been specifically authorised and controlled by Triboo Digitale and DAINESE, in order to prevent all unauthorised access to data and illegal processing by third parties.  The categories of persons in charge of processing are detailed in the disclosure given at the foot of this Privacy Policy.

Personal Data is mainly processed in electronic format and in some cases, also as hard copies, such as, for example, when Personal Data processing is necessary to prevent fraud on the Website. Personal Data will be stored in a way that allows for the identification of the User only for the time strictly necessary to the purpose for which the data was collected and subsequently processed and, in any case, within the legal limits. In order to guarantee that the Personal Data is always exact and up-to-date, in any case pertinent and complete, we would ask that you please inform us of any change made to the following e-mail address: [dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com](mailto:dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com). 

Personal Data will not be disclosed to third parties for any purpose not permitted by the law or without your specific consent. In addition to the companies acting as data supervisors, the Personal Data will also be made available to third parties, independent data controllers, for purposes accessory and related to the provision of the services requested by the User (e.g. for purchase-related transactions). You can obtain and updated list of data supervisors at any time by e-mailing: [dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com](mailto:dainese.dstoreonline@fullycommerce.com).

Personal Data will not be transferred abroad to any countries other than European Union Member States (apart from companies belonging to the Dainese Group), which do not ensure adequate personal protection levels. If it should be necessary for the pursuit of the Commercial Purposes, we can assure you that the transfer of Personal Data to non-European Union Member States (with the exception of companies belonging to the Dainese Group) and which do not ensure adequate protection levels, will only be carried out upon stipulation by Triboo Digitale and said subjects with reference to the Commercial Purposes, or between DAINESE and said subjects with reference to the Website or DAINESE Marketing Purposes, of specific contracts containing clauses safeguarding the protection of the Personal Data, in compliance with the law and applicable regulations.

Triboo Digitale and DAINESE may find themselves processing Personal Data pertaining to third parties, disclosed to them directly by the Users, such as, for example, where a User has purchased a product to be delivered to a friend, or when the person paying the price for the purchase of the product differs from the product addressee, or when the User intends to inform a friend of a service or product on sale on the Website. In all these cases, please ensure that consent is obtained from the person to whom the data refers, before disclosing said data to Triboo Digitale and/or DAINESE and inform them of this Privacy Policy; the User will be the only party responsible for the disclosure of information and data relating to third parties without their specific request to do so and for any incorrect or unlawful use thereof. In any case, in compliance with the limits laid down by legislation, Triboo Digitale and DAINESE shall comply with the disclosure obligation with regards to the User notified and, where necessary, shall request their specific consent upon entering the related Personal Data in their archives.

**3\. What happens if you refuse to give Triboo Digitale and DAINESE your personal data**

Conferral to Triboo Digitale of Personal Data for the Commercial Purposes (more specifically, personal data, your e-mail address, your postal address, your credit/debit card details and bank details and telephone number) is required for the pursuit of the Commercial Purposes. An refusal to provide Triboo Digitale with the Personal Data required to this end may make it impossible to fulfil the contract for the purchase of the products on the Website or to correctly fulfil legal and regulatory requirements. Failure to provide Personal Data may potentially constitute lawful, justified grounds not to fulfil the contract for the purchase of products on the Website. The supply of additional Personal Data, apart from compulsory data, is optional and shall have no consequences as concerns the purchase of products on the Website.

Conferral to DAINESE of Personal Data for Marketing Purposes is always optional and is connected with registration with the Website. Failure to provide such and failure to give consent to processing for Marketing Purposes shall have no consequence in terms of the buying process, except that it will be impossible to complete registration and therefore to benefit from services such as newsletters, generalised or personalised offers and access to reserved promotional areas. 

From time to time, we will duly inform you of the compulsory or optional nature of the disclosure of Personal Data to Triboo Digitale and DAINESE and any consequences of non-conferral. Please remember that failure to provide optional Personal Data will not result in any obligation or disadvantage for the Users. 

**4\. To whom to we disclose the Personal Data**

Personal Data may be made available to third party companies providing specific services on behalf of Triboo Digitale and DAINESE, as data supervisors, or disclosed to further third parties - whose names will be specified as applicable -, who process the data independently, purely in order to implement the contract for the purchase of products on the Website (such as, for example, banks, for remote electronic payment services, by means of credit/debit card) and only when this purpose is not incompatible with the purposes for which the Personal Data was collected and subsequently processed and, in any case, in compliance with the law.

More specifically, Triboo Digitale uses DAINESE, as external supervisor, to process the Personal Data of Users needed to fulfil, under the scope of the Commercial Purposes, the delivery, return and management of non-conformities in connection with the products purchased on the Website, as better described in the Website Conditions of Sale, which can be consulted on the following [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20161222011700id_/http://www.dainese.com/eu_en/privacy/%7B%7Bstore%20direct_url='termsconditions'%7D%7D). To this end, in turn, DAINESE uses professional couriers (UPS, Federal Express, DHL, etc.) for delivery, which, as external supervisors, will process the personal data of Users purely in order to complete the task assigned them.

For the Marketing Purposes, DAINESE also uses third party companies operating as external data supervisors; the supervisors appointed also include Triboo Digitale, which provides DAINESE with management services of the on-line DAINESE store, as specifically envisaged in the Conditions of Sale, available at the following [link](https://web.archive.org/web/20161222011700id_/http://www.dainese.com/eu_en/privacy/%7B%7Bstore%20direct_url='termsconditions'%7D%7D) and NWeb S.r.l., with registered office at Viale Francesco Restelli, 1 - 20124 - Milan (MI) - Tax Code and VAT no. 01279550196, which provides DAINESE with mass mailing services for the newsletters, using the MailUp utility.

If the collaboration between Triboo Digitale and DAINESE concerning the management by the former of the sales of products pertaining to the latter via the Website should cease, Triboo Digitale will send DAINESE the data of all Users who have completed the Website registration procedure, in order to enable it to ensure, for each of said Users: 

(a) continued use of the personal credentials; 

(b) storage of details of past transactions; 

(c) keeping the specific consent given to personal data processing on record.

The Personal Data will not be disclosed, sold or in any other way transferred to third parties unless the Users have been informed of this in advance and given their consent, where required by the law. 

**5\. How is Personal Data collected on the Website**

Triboo Digitale and DAINESE collect Personal Data and other information directly from the Users as part of the processes that each of the two companies respectively manage (purchase of products on the Website for the stipulation of electronic trade transactions/completion of User registration forms with the Website for the Marketing Purposes of DAINESE).

More specifically, in the pursuit of the Commercial Purposes, under the scope of the buying process of products on the Website, Triboo Digitale collects Personal Data (such as personal data, e-mail address, postal address, credit card and bank details, telephone number) by means of the order form for the sale of products on the Website. 

This data is processed by Triboo Digitale and DAINESE within the limits and for the purposes explained in paragraph 2 above and in the disclosure at the foot of this Privacy Policy.

**6\. Security measures  **

Triboo Digitale and DAINESE take suitable security measures by which to minimise the risk of the deliberate or accidental destruction or loss of Personal Data, unauthorised access or processing that is either not permitted or not compliant with the purposes of collection, as specified in this Privacy Policy.

As regards the best possible protection of your Personal Data, for all aspects that lie outside the control and management of Triboo Digitale and DAINESE, we recommend that you ensure that the computer used has suitable software installed to protect data transmission over the internet, both incoming and outgoing (such as updated anti-virus systems) and that the chosen internet supplier has taken suitable steps to ensure the security of data transmission over the internet (such as firewalls and anti-spamming filters). 

**7\. Compulsory processing**

Please note that Triboo Digitale and DAINESE may process Personal Data even without consent in certain cases established by the law, such as, for example, where such should be necessary in order to fulfil a legal obligation. 

For example, Personal Data can be disclosed to police forces or legal authorities, in compliance with the law and upon formal request by such parties, for example under the scope of anti-fraud services.
