# Privacy Policy

**Do you have a privacy policy?**

We will NEVER sell your information or bombard you with promotional emails. When you sign up to make a purchase, we only use your information to tell you when your product has shipped, or to give you other important information related to your purchase. Of course, we'd love you to sign up for our daily email so you can keep track of our newest deals, but that's entirely up to you -- if you choose not to sign up, we won't take it personally.

**Is my credit card information safe?**

Safer than Fort Knox. Your credit card information is never stored on our servers. Your payment information is transmitted directly to a secure third-party server â€“ you can tell you're on a safe page by the padlock icon that appears on your browser. When you make an order, our system scans your information for potential fraud. If there is a reason to suspect fraud, we will contact you to verify your order. If you do not verify with us within 24 hours, the order will be cancelled.

**How do I pay for my item?**

We accept all major credit cards as well as PayPal. We do NOT accept Monopoly money under ANY circumstances.

By using our website and providing data, you consent to the collection and use of the data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and in accordance with the Terms of Use. In the event we change our Privacy Policy, the changes will be posted on this page. Our website may use "cookies" which are small pieces of information that a website stores on a visitor's web browser to remind the website about the visitor the next time they visit the website. We expressly disclaim responsibility for the privacy policies and customer information practices of third party internet sites linked to our website.
