DailyGame values your privacy as much as our own. Any and all email messages, contest entries or other forms of correspondence will be kept private and for use **only** with regard to their intended purpose (answering questions, accepting contest entries, etc.). We will not share your contact information with any outside party unless a third party is needed for shipping (this rarely happens), and we will delete all contest entries immediately upon confirmation of the winners' address.
