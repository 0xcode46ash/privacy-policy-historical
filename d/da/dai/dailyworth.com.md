DailyWorth will never rent, share, or sell our subscriber list. We appreciate your faith in us, and we promise not to abuse your trust. The policy below describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our site and/or register for DailyWorth.

#### Your Information

We collect your email address, a username and a password. DailyWorth doesn't collect any information except that expressly provided by you. We will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent, except as required to provide you with DailyWorth material.

#### Other Information

In order to make our site better, we may also request other information from you. Just generic stuff -- like income level or age, that will help us tailor the site to your needs. We may also share this information with third parties, _but only in aggregate, anonymous form._ No third party will receive information from us that personally identifies you or anyone else in any way.

#### Usage Information

It is important for us to gather information on how our site is used: How much time do users spend on our site? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to once they've had just about enough of our smartass attitude? All of this information is collected in aggregate form. None of it is personally identifiable.

#### Review and Access

If you request it, DailyWorth will provide you with a summary of the information we've collected about you, and the opportunity to correct, update or modify this information. You don't even have to ask nicely.

#### How to Unsubscribe

You can unsubscribe from receiving DailyWorth emails at any time. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of any DailyWorth email. Or you can email us, contact (at) dailyworth.com and put "unsubscribe" in the subject line.

#### Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by Google, our Web advertising partner. View Google's privacy policy [here](http://www.google.com/privacy.html).

Occasionally, you'll get an email marked "Dedicated Email" in the subject line and in the email header. These emails are not necessarily reflective of the opinions of our editorial staff. They are content paid for by our advertising partners.

You can unsubscribe from receiving Dedicated Emails. However, if you do so, you will no longer receive DailyWorth emails either. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of any DailyWorth email.

#### Cookies

Cookies are small text files placed on your computer, in order to help websites like ours retrieve information vital to providing the best possible service. Our cookies allow us to recognize you and simplify your user experience. DailyWorth will never use cookies to obtain any information from your computer not related to our site.

#### Third Party Cookies

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

DailyWorth may make changes to this policy in the future. If and when we do, we'll be sure to inform you here.
