COOKIES

Cookies are small files placed on your computer by a web page when you visit it. They can be used to store all sorts of useful information to make your next visit easier and more convenient, but some people are uncomfortable not knowing what information is in a cookie. This website uses cookies only to compile statistics on the use of the various pages on our site (how many people visit each page and that sort of thing). We do not store or collect any personally identifiable information.

DISCUSSION BOARD

If you choose to participate on The Daily Reckoning's Discussion Board, you do so at your own risk.

You must submit a name to post a message to the Discussion Board, but it doesn't have to be your real name. Using your real name or e-mail address when you post is entirely voluntary. In fact, it's just not a good idea. Agora does not collect e-mail addresses from the Discussion Board, but there is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous person or company from doing so and then using that address to send you unwanted e-mail (spam).

Aliases are completely acceptable--but only as long as they are unique and not meant to impersonate another person (for example, "Bill Bonner" is not acceptable). If you feel that someone is impersonating you on our Discussion Board, please contact  [ dr@dailyreckoning.com](mailto:dr@dailyreckoning.com?subject=Privacy%20Policy "Privacy Policy"). We will take whatever steps we deem necessary, possibly including legal action, to correct the matter.

We reserve the right to remove any messages from the board for any reason whatsoever. We prohibit or strongly discourage: advertisements to buy or sell securities, promotions and advertisements of any type and links thereto, impersonating another person, unnecessary profanity, ludicrous and thoroughly discredited conspiracy theories, and personal attacks. However, we cannot be held responsible for any claims made on our Discussion Board.

REVISIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY WITHOUT NOTICE

This Privacy Policy is dynamic. It will continually change. You may not assume that it remains the same and you agree to check the policy each time you visit the site for changes. Unless, in the sole opinion of the website, this policy changes so drastically as to suggest a posted notification on the site or via email, you will receive no notification of changes to this Privacy Policy nor, under any circumstances, does this site promise notification. Your continued use of this site always evidences your acceptance of the terms this Privacy Policy or any modifications.
