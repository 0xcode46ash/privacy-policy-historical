We take your privacy very seriously. 

##  Introduction 

dailyamazingfacts.net (“Daily Amazing Facts”) takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. 

This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our websites. Please read this notice very carefully. 

##  Website Visitors 

Like most website operators, Daily Amazing Facts collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Daily Amazing Facts’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Daily Amazing Facts’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Daily Amazing Facts may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g. by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Daily Amazing Facts also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Daily Amazing Facts does not use such information to identify its visitors, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

##  Aggregated Statistics 

Daily Amazing Facts may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Daily Amazing Facts may monitor the most popular collections on dailyamazingfacts.net. Daily Amazing Facts may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Daily Amazing Facts does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

##  Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information 

Daily Amazing Facts discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Daily Amazing Facts’s behalf or to provide services available at Daily Amazing Facts’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Daily Amazing Facts’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. In addition, in some cases we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Daily Amazing Facts or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Daily Amazing Facts goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Daily Amazing Facts may continue to use your personal and non-personal information only as set forth in this policy. Otherwise, Daily Amazing Facts will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. 

Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Daily Amazing Facts discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Daily Amazing Facts believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Daily Amazing Facts, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Daily Amazing Facts website and have supplied your email address, Daily Amazing Facts may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Daily Amazing Facts and its products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Daily Amazing Facts takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

This privacy policy only applies to information collected by Daily Amazing Facts. This privacy policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Daily Amazing Facts does not own or control, or employees that Daily Amazing Facts does not manage. A Daily Amazing Facts website may contain links to third party websites. Any information you provide to, or that is collected by, third-party sites may be subject to the privacy policies of those sites, if any.
