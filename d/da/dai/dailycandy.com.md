##### Personal Information

Similarly, in order to supply you with text-messaging services, we need your phone number and your provider information. So that we may provide you with additional services, we may also request your name, geographical coordinates, and telephone number. DailyCandy does not collect any other personal information that you do not expressly provide. DailyCandy will never sell, rent, or share your personal information, including your e-mail address, with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

We may also share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in advertising in the DailyCandy e-mail or on the site, in aggregate, anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you or any other person.

##### Usage Information

In addition to collecting personal and non-personal information, DailyCandy may also collect non-personal, aggregated information about subscribers' use of DailyCandy e-mails and the website. This information is not personally identifiable and will be used only to find out how subscribers use our service and site.

The collection of this information allows us to, among other things, prepare for traffic load demands and to efficiently deliver your Candy.

Upon your request, we will provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have an opportunity to correct, update, or modify this information.

##### Choice/Opt Out

If we ever send you information by e-mail concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, we will provide you with an e-mail address by which you may request no future notices.
