# Dairy Queen: US

International Dairy Queen, Inc. (IDQ) and its subsidiary companies respect the privacy of on-line visitors. We may use “cookie” or similar technology to obtain non-personal information from visitors (for example, to count the total number of visitors to this site).

We do not acquire personal information about individually identifiable visitors unless it is voluntarily submitted. Personal information that is voluntarily submitted is not sold, transferred, or otherwise disclosed to unrelated entities, unless required by law. Only visitors who request email would receive email.

We reserve the right to modify this policy, and we recommend that you check this page from time to time for changes.

IDQ encourages parents to supervise their children’s internet activities.

Additional information for parents concerning the Dairyqueenkids.com portion of the website:

Content:

Our goal is to make Dairyqueenkids.com fun and interactive for both kids and parents. The internet presents a unique opportunity for us to provide kids with interactive games, fun sweepstakes, contests and coloring sheets. Because the majority of visitors on the kids site are kids under 13, we are committed to making sure that the content is appropriate for this audience.

This site will from time to time contain advertising material which is intended to promote Dairy Queen® store locations, kids meals and special toys. You may wish to explain this to your children.

Collecting Information:

Our goal is to create website content that requires minimum collection of information from our visitors.

Dairyqueenkids.com will not condition a kid’s participation in any of our online activities on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity.

Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites:

Our site may contain links to other sites whose information practices may be different from ours. Visitors should consult these other third party sites’ privacy notices, since these sites are not covered by our privacy policy and may follow different procedures.

Online Polls or Surveys:

For online polls or surveys, we may ask visitors to provide information that is not personally identifiable. This might include first name, city or state of residence, age, gender or school.

Contest and Sweepstakes:

For contests and sweepstakes on Dairyqueenkids.com, we may collect a participant’s e-mail address for the sole purpose of communicating with the participant on a one-time basis, should he or she become a potential winner. Before any prize is sent out, he or she, together with a parent or guardian, must sign and return to us the affidavit of eligibility.

CARU Guidelines:

It is our intention to adhere to the Better Business Bureau’s Children’s Advertising Review Unit (CARU) guidelines, including its guidelines on Internet advertising.

Reminder to Parents:

We encourage parents to monitor their children’s online use. Please instruct your children never to give out their names, addresses, phone numbers or e-mail addresses to anyone on the web without your permission.
