##  Our privacy policy

This policy covers all users who register to use the dabs.com website.

**Principle 1 - Notice**  
During our registration process, we ask for personal information which both identifies you and enables us to communicate with you.  We also invite you to tell us your interests so that we can make our communications relevant and interesting for you. 

We will use the information you provide only for the following purposes: 

  * To send you newsletters and details of offers and promotions in which we beleive you will be interested 
  * To improve the content, design and layout of the dabs.com website and to facilitate knowledge management 
  * To understand the interests and buying behaviour of our registered users 
  * To perform other such general marketing and promotional activities focused on our products and services 
  * We may also register you for our other services which we feel may be useful or of interest to you 



This privacy policy only covers the dabs.com website at [http://www.dabs.com](http://www.dabs.com/). Other links within this site to other websites or framed third party sites within dabs.com are not covered by this policy. We may continue to use your personal information for a period after you cease being a registered user. 

**Principle 2 - Consent and Choice**  
If you choose not to register or not provide personal information, you may still visit the dabs.com website but you will not be able to access the restricted areas available to registered users. By completing the registration process, you accept the Terms and Conditions described and consent to our using your information accordingly.   
**  
Principle 3 - Access**  
We have provided an administration service (your account) where you can review your personal information at any time to ensure it is correct and current. You will be able to update, correct, change or delete inaccurate details. You may also change your choice of opting in or out of marketing and promotional activities, although you may continue to receive mailings for a short period while your change is being processed. You have the right to ask for a copy of your personal information on payment of a small fee.   
**  
Principle 4 - Security  
** We have taken appropriate measures to ensure that your personal information is not unlawfully processed. dabs.com uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information, including "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. dabs.com treats data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access.  However, no information transferred over the Internet or wireless network can be guaranteed to be completely secure. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorised access by users inside and outside the company. 

We will not be transferring your personal information outside of the European Economic Area unless otherwise specifically advised.
