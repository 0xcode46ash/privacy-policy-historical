# Privacy policy

Your [security](https://web.archive.org/en/security) and privacy are our top priorities. We built Dashlane with the clear understanding that your personal data is private and that it should not be accessible to anyone, not even us. Here is what that means: 

All the personal data you enter in to Dashlane is strictly private. This includes everything from your name, addresses, and phone numbers to your IDs and credit card information. All of this information is [secured](https://web.archive.org/en/security) with strong encryption for which you alone have the key. No one – not even our brilliant Dashlane engineers – can access it. We built our product this way so no one could ever access any information that might be directly linked to you. 

The only piece of data we have access to is the email address you used to register with Dashlane, and which you use as your login. (If you chose to provide a mobile phone number when you registered, for security purposes, this is also in our database.) That being said, we will never share this information with anyone. 

We do collect technical and usage data in order to improve the Dashlane product for you, but the data we collect is completely anonymous and cannot in any way be linked to personal information – not even the email address you registered with and use to log in. 

Dashlane is all about giving you control of your own data. Because, you know, it's yours.
