# Privacy Policy | Dashlane

## Date Last Revised: July 26, 2018

Welcome to Dashlane! Dashlane, Inc. (a Delaware corporation), (“ **Dashlane** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”) has prepared this Privacy Policy to describe to you our privacy practices regarding the Information (as defined below) we collect from users of our website at www.dashlane.com (the “ **Site** ”), the Dashlane software application (available in both desktop and mobile versions) that enables users to simplify and expedite their experience on the web by storing their data in a secure vault and actively using it to perform online transactional and navigational processes (the “ **App** ”), and online services available therein (collectively, the “ **Services** ”).

**User Consent.** By submitting personal data through our Site or Services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy and you expressly consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**A Note About Children.** We do not intentionally gather Information (as defined below) from visitors who are under the age of 13. If a child under 13 submits Information to Dashlane and we learn that the Information is the information of a child under 13, we will attempt to delete the Information as soon as possible. If you believe that we might have any Information from a child under 13, please contact us at support@dashlane.com.

**What Information does Dashlane Collect?**

Information You Provide. Dashlane collects information that you voluntarily provide on our Site, App and Services. For example:

• **Registration Information** : When you create a Dashlane account (an “ **Account** ”), we ask you to provide an email address that will be used as your login. In addition, you are required to create a “ **Master Password** ” used to access your Account. Your Master Password is the basis for the encryption key used in protecting your Encrypted Sensitive Information (see below). Your Master Password is not known to Dashlane and is not stored in any digital form unless you explicitly ask to do so. When you enable specific services, we may collect additional information that you knowingly provide. 

• **Encrypted Sensitive Information** : In order to use the password manager and secure digital wallet elements of the Services you will enter certain information into the App, including highly sensitive information like names, addresses, phone numbers, identity information, credit card information, passwords, receipts for online transactions and secure notes (“ **Encrypted Sensitive Information** ”). The Encrypted Sensitive Information is encrypted locally on your device using strong encryption and is backed up on the Dashlane cloud. None of it is viewable to Dashlane because it is encrypted with the Master Password. If you choose to synchronize your Encrypted Sensitive Information with more than one device (each an “ **Authorized Device** ” via the Services, the “ **Sync Function** ”), the Services are designed to transmit and store the Encrypted Sensitive Information through the Dashlane cloud to the Authorized Device(s) using strong encryption and in a manner that Dashlane will not be able to read. 

• **Billing information** : When you pay for certain services (for example, Premium Services) we will collect all information necessary to complete the transaction, including your name and billing address. Other billing information necessary to complete the transaction, like your credit card information, is collected by our payment processor, but is not made available to Dashlane.

• **Anonymous Usage Information** : As described in more detail in the “Information Collected Via Technology” section below, during your use of our Services, we automatically collect certain information and technical data about the use of our Services. All Usage Information is Anonymous Information as defined below. 

• **Feedback** : If you provide us feedback or send us an email, we will collect your e-mail address as well as the content of your email in order to communicate with you and send you a reply. 

• **Miscellaneous Information**. We also collect other types of information where: (a) you provide it to us voluntarily, for example, if you contact us regarding support for the Services, or (b) in the manner disclosed by us at the time that such information is being collected.

We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site and Services, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, better tailor our Services to our users’ needs, and for the purposes of fraud detection and authentication. 

• Cookies. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. **“Cookies”** are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer for a period of one year from the date you last visited the Site unless you earlier delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs.

Information Collected from You About Others. If you invite someone to create an Account through the Services (a “ **Referral** ”), Dashlane will store the email address of the Referral and the message you have sent, in order to send an email and follow up with the Referral. We rely upon you to obtain whatever consents from the Referral that may be required by law to allow us to access and upload the Referral contact information as required above.

**How secure is your Information?**

The security of the Information that you enter in the Dashlane App is extremely important to Dashlane. This is why Dashlane implements a variety of security measures, including AES 256-bit encryption designed to prevent unauthorized access, alteration, and use of your Encrypted Sensitive Information. While Dashlane has gone to great lengths to protect your Information, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; therefore, Dashlane cannot guarantee its absolute security. In addition, the security of your Information also depends on how you use the Dashlane App and Services and protect the Master Password that enables you to access your Account and decrypt your Encrypted Sensitive Information. We therefore strongly recommend that you carefully read and implement the Dashlane security guidelines available here: https://www.dashlane.com/en/security/.
