### Media Kit

](https://web.archive.org/media.php) |  The Dave's Garden Team respects the privacy of the users of this website. Because we share your privacy concerns, we have published this privacy policy to help you understand what information we collect as a result of your use of this site, and what we do with that information. 

The type of information we gather falls into the categories below.

| **User Information and How it is Gathered** | **What We Do with that Information**  
---|---  
**General Tracking Information**

We keep track of the pages you visit on our site, and our web server automatically gives us a report of the overall traffic of the site, each day. Stored within that report is your IP address, browser type, http referers, date and time of the access, and the page you accessed.

| We aggregate this data with the data collected from all the other users of this site, and prepare reports for our own use in determining the growth and usage numbers of the site. This information does not identify you personally.  
**User Registration**

When you sign for a username on this site, we collect from you your desired username and your email address.

| The E-mail address is hidden from view at all times, and is never released to **any** third-party source. The address is used only by Dave's Garden to contact you through our website. 

We require an e-mail address because, unlike your real name, it identifies you uniquely. We will send you an e-mail confirming your registration on our site, and in the event you forget your password, we will send it to your e-mail address at your request. The E-mail address is also required in order for us to contact you in the event of problems, and is needed for you to take advantage of many of the features of this site (mailing other members through the system, receiving nightly newsletters, etc).  
  
**User Subscription**

When you decide to purchase a subscription and become a dues-paying member of the site, we collect the information we need to process your payment.

| If you pay by PayPal, Cash or Money Order, we will not have or need any additional information from you.

If you pay by check, we will automatically have whatever information you give on your checks.

If you pay by credit card, we will need to collect your billing information, including your full name, billing address, city, state, zip, country, credit card type, credit card number, and expiration date. The billing information (except the credit card information) is stored on our server as a convenience to you (it will be used again next time you re-subscribe) but the credit card information is never stored here. None of this information is ever shared with any other parties, except as it is necesssary for banking (depositing checks to the bank, and processing the credit card through our merchant account).   
  
**Yes, we use cookies**

But only for login, and not for any other use.

| We require cookies only for the login of the system. They are not used for tracking, but are used to identify you, as a member, to our server. Without cookies, it would be impossible for us to have logins and member accounts, rendering DG useless. This is the use that cookies were invented for in the first place.  
**Your city, state, zipcode, and country**

After obtaining your permission, these are published along with your user information.

| Dave's Garden is a community type website, and members enjoy knowing the general whereabouts of the other people who join. For this reason, we give members the opportunity to publish their city, state, zip and country. Anytime, outside of the subscription system, that the system asks for your zipcode or other location information, that may be published next to your name.
