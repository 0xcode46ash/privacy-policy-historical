**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**   
David's Bridal collects information online for the purpose of fulfilling your requests. When you join our registry, we collect your name address and phone number. While not required, we also ask that you provide us with additional information about yourself such as email address.

The information collected is also used to administer our contests and to notify the winners. 

**Will we disclose the information collected to outside parties?**   
The information collected is sent to the David's Bridal corporate offices for the purpose of providing you with information regarding special events and offers specific to your area. We may also share your information with our family of companies and with third party companies which we believe have merchandise or services complementary to our merchandise and services. If you wish to permanently opt out of these offers, please send an e-mail to [remove@davidsprom.com](mailto:remove@davidsprom.com). 

We may also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site and to share with other May Company divisions. For example, we may tell another May Company division that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that Y number of women who filled out our registration form are from the northeast U.S. 

**How does David's Bridal protect customer information?**   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online -- for example on message boards, through e-mail or in chat areas -- that information can be collected and used by others. In addition, the privacy policies of other Web sites will vary, while many will have no stated privacy policy.
