### Use of Cookies

Like many websites, we use "cookies” to enable us to personalize your visits to this website, simplify the signing-in procedure, keep track of your preferences and to track the usage of this website. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored in the hard drive of your computer by your browser. Your browser will have the option to prevent websites using cookies (your browser’s help screen or manual will tell you how to do this), but please note that this may reduce the functionality of this Site and other websites. Like all websites, our servers automatically record ‘log files’ containing information about the volume and characteristics of our website traffic e.g. IP address, numbers of pages viewed, length of time spent on site. We use log files to build pictures of how our site is used that help us to monitor and improve the service. We cannot identify you from your log files.

Cookies are files that your Web browser places on your computer’s hard drive that permit us to tell whether, and if so, how many times, you have accessed our Web site previously, your interests and preferences, your language of choice, where your internet provider resides, internet user behavioral analysis, and your computer system’s flash preference. You may choose to decline to accept cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of our Web site and your ability to access certain features of the Web site.

A pixel tag is a transparent graphic image, sometimes called a Web beacon, clear GIFs or tracking beacon, placed on a Web site or in an e-mail, which indicates to us that a page or e-mail has been viewed. In addition, a pixel tag may tell your browser to get content from another server.

We retain access to all personal information that we have collected from you.

We, or our service providers, may use cookies, web beacons/pixel tags, log files, and other technologies to collect information about visitors to our website, use of our online services, and interactions with our emails and online advertisements, such as your browser type and operating system, viewed webpages, links that are clicked, IP address, sites visited before coming to our website, emails we send that you open, forward, or click through to our website. Collecting this information, and linking it with your personal information, helps us to tailor our website and enhance your online shopping experience by saving your preferences while you are visiting a particular site, and to help identify site features, promotions, advertisements, and offers that may be of particular interest to you.

In this case, we will determine your postal code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the postal codes associated with the location. Our mobile applications offer automatic (push) notifications. We will provide push notifications only to those who opt-in to receive them. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

### Protecting Your Security

Protecting the security of your information is very important to us. When you transmit sensitive personal information (such as credit card information) from your computer to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. For our mobile website, we protect your payment card information using encryption technology when you place an order. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to secure and protect the information on our systems. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure and, accordingly, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online. However, we strive to protect your information and privacy.

Because of the international nature of the services and products we provide on our website and the nature of our business, personal data may, subject to applicable law, be transferred internationally throughout Danier worldwide for the purposes described above. This may mean that personal data are transferred to countries which do not have laws or regulations that protect personal data, unlike Canada does, where the server for our website is located. We use reasonable measures to limit the disclosure of the data you provide to us only to certain staff within Danier and our affiliates (i.e. staff whose job it is to process your inquiries and survey answers or otherwise to administer **DANIER.com** , and those staff involved in the provision of our services and products which may be of interest to you) and to require that they process the data only for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.

To protect our customers from fraudulent transactions on danier.com, all orders are subject to review and verification. As part of the verification process, an order may be temporarily placed on hold in order to verify order information: that includes, but is not limited to, credit card billing information, which may involve contacting the credit card holder directly.

We follow strict security procedures to ensure that your personal information is not damaged, destroyed, or disclosed to a third party without your permission and to prevent unauthorized access to it. The computers that store the information are kept in a secure facility with restricted physical access and we use secure firewalls and other measures to restrict electronic access.

All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. You can update the personal information that you give us at any time by viewing ["Your Account"](https://www.saksfifthavenue.com/account/login.jsp)   page. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.

### Legal Disclosures

Danier may disclose the information we receive from and about you to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies in accordance with applicable law. We also reserve the right to share information with legal authorities and other companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction, or to avoid injury to our rights or the rights of any other person.

During the normal course of our business, we may sell or purchase assets. If another entity acquires all or a part of Danier or its affiliated companies, information we have collected about you may be transferred to such entity.

In addition, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against Danier and its affiliated companies, such information may be considered an asset of the company and may be sold or transferred to third parties. Should a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to require that the transferee use personally identifiable information provided through this website in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.

If our business enters into a joint venture with or is sold to or merged with another business entity, your information may be disclosed to our new business partners or owners.
