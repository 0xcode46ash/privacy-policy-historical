# Privacy Policy

There are two things to know about privacy on danosongs.com:

1\. If you enter your email to get the 30 free mp3 downloads you don’t get subscribed to anything. You just get an email with links to a few zip files. In that email you have the option to click to subscribe to my blog posts. The email delivery is done by Google Feedburner. I don’t do anything else with your email. You can always unsubscribe by clicking at the bottom of the emails.

2\. This site uses Google Adsense for ads. Google requires that I show the following notice:

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

  * Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on your site.
  * Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it and its partners to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and/or other sites on the Internet.
  * Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).
