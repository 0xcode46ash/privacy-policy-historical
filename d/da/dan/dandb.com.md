We collect identifiable business information from website visitors when they decide to apply for a D&B D-U-N-S® Number, register for a newsletter or e-mail alert, fill-out an optional survey, fill out an online form, or purchase a product or service online. We may also collect information offline from business owners, principals, and third parties, from businesses’ creditors, vendors and suppliers, and from public records such as business registrations, Uniform Commercial Code filings and bankruptcy filings. The business information that we collect includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:

  * Company and business professional contact information, including name, title, address, phone number, fax number and e-mail address;
  * Detailed company profiles and statistics, including number of employees;

We also collect information about website visitors indirectly through standard web logs, such as IP addresses, browser types (e.g. Internet Explorer), areas of the website that are visited and the website from which a visitor came. We routinely use this web log information in the aggregate in order to administer and improve our website. While some of this data may be traceable to an individual, we only seek to identify individuals whom we believe are using our website for improper purposes. Dun & Bradstreet does not respond to Do Not Track signals.

**How Do We Use and Share Information?**

Dun & Bradstreet uses the identifiable business and business professional information that we collect to contact customers in order to offer customers a variety of business information products and services. Dun & Bradstreet also licenses business lists to authorized resellers and third party businesses for marketing purposes. Dun & Bradstreet shares information with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, live help/chat providers auditors, attorneys, consultants and contractors, in order to support Dun & Bradstreet’s Internet websites and business operations. Dun & Bradstreet contractually requires that these recipients only use the information for the intended purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the information when it is no longer needed. When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order, subpoena, law enforcement proceeding, regulatory inquiry or when otherwise legally required. We may also disclose information as required or appropriate in order to protect our website, business operations, employees, customers or legal rights, or in connection with a sale or merger involving Dun & Bradstreet assets (including information collected from you) or businesses. From time to time, Dun & Bradstreet compiles online and offline transaction and registration information for internal analyses, such as market research, quality assurance, customer experience and operational benchmarking initiatives.

**Collection of Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information**

Dun & Bradstreet may collect sensitive personally identifiable information associated with certain customers, in order to provide certain product and service offerings. We will only collect this information if it is necessary to fulfill certain product orders and only when voluntarily provided by the customer, we will only use it for the limited, permissible purpose for which it is collected and we will take commercially reasonable steps to adequately secure the information.

**Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and GIFs**

We design the layout and features of our website so that new visitors may anonymously learn about our products and services without revealing their identities. For new visitors, we use cookies or Web beacons to collect limited data, such as the date, time and areas of our website that are visited, as well as the website from which the new visitor came. When you select one of our products or services, register for a newsletter or e-mail alert, complete an online form, or complete an optional survey, we may try to identify your browser and we may combine information from cookies, Web beacons and other information collected online with other data that we maintain about you. By improving the features, marketing and content of our website and by making your online experience more convenient and meaningful, we are able to better serve our customers’ needs.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive that often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that website’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this text file in a section of your hard drive that is specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. Your browser will only permit a website to access the cookies that it has previously sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Some of our business partners, such as third party advertisers, use cookies that originate from their websites. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. For more information, please see the “Third Party Advertisers” section below. We use cookies to store login or other information on your computer, which serves to improve our website functionality and tailor our services to your preferences and interests. For certain services, we offer users the ability to store a user ID or password within a cookie so that they do not need to re-enter it when they subsequently return to our website. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and to assess which parts of the site are most popular. This information helps us to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers and for this reason some of our cookies may be tied to personally identifiable information. We do not store credit/debit card numbers in cookies. Most Internet browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies and how long to keep them on their hard drive. You may reset your browser to refuse cookies and still use our website, although website access and functionality may be slower and less convenient.

A Web beacon is a graphic image, such as a pixel tag or clear GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity, such as whether the Web page or e-mail message is accessed or clicked. They are often invisible because they are very small in size. They are also used on many Web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our website or to gather statistics about browser usage on our website. Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. Web beacons may also be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.

We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:

We use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. In the course of serving advertisements, our third party advertisers and partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These companies may use information about your visits to [www.DandB.com](https://web.archive.org/), [smallbusiness.dnb.com](http://smallbusiness.dnb.com/), [mycredit.dnb.com](https://mycredit.dnb.com/), [www.credibilitylive.com](http://www.credibilitylive.com/), [www.accesstocapital.com](http://www.accesstocapital.com/), and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third party partners monitor how guests use our website and determine which of our online features they prefer. We may report information to our partners about our customers and the products and services they order, as well as aggregated, non-identifiable information about our guests’ use of our website. For more information, please see the “Third Party Advertisers” section below.

**Third Party Advertisers**

The use of third party cookies and other tracking technologies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control of any third party tracking technologies. We use third party advertising companies to serve our Internet ad banners on our website and other websites on which we advertise. If you view a Web page where our ads appear, the advertising company may place a cookie on your computer or use a Web beacon to access a cookie that they previously placed on your computer. These companies do not collect information that can personally identify you, but they may use information about your visits to our website and other websites to measure the effectiveness of ads. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to these companies. We share aggregate website usage information with third party advertisers and partners for the purpose of effectively targeting our online advertisements. Unless you are previously notified, these advertising companies do not link any online behavior or cookies with other information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, when working with Dun& Bradstreet

These third party advertising networks also track visitors’ online usage and behavior patterns. These companies may use information about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The result of these efforts is the creation of an online profile that attempts to predict individual user interests, preferences and purchasing habits. The third party advertising networks then accordingly customize the advertising content served to users when visiting other websites.

The  _Network Advertising Initiative  _(NAI) is a self-regulatory cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies. The NAI provides educational content and opt-out tools to help Internet users learn about and address online behavioral marketing practices. Through the NAI’s online options, you may opt out of particular NAI network members’ behavioral advertising programs or you may opt out of all NAI network members’ programs. Opting out will prevent the given network from which you opted out from using your Web preferences and usage patterns to deliver targeted online ads. The NAI opt-out only works with participating third party advertising networks that use cookies and Web beacons to execute their advertising initiatives. If you would like additional information about online behavioral marketing and your options regarding these standard Internet practices, please visit the [NAI website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/index.asp). Our third-party advertisers may also use a third party analytics provider to place third-party cookies on your browser in order to collect anonymous and aggregated session data, such as the ads that are viewed.

**Data Retention and Security**

Dun & Bradstreet will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at [customersupport@DandB.com](mailto:customersupport@DandB.com). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Dun & Bradstreet maintains data security measures to protect information against unauthorized access and disclosure. These measures include the implementation of commercially reasonable technical, physical and administrative data security safeguards. We require employees to complete appropriate training on data management and security practices. We also manage a service provider due diligence and oversight program to ensure that our vendors likewise employ data collection, processing, transfer, management, and security measures to safeguard collected information in carrying out their services on our behalf.

There is no such thing as “guaranteed security,” whether conducting business online or offline. While we employ commercially reasonable and appropriate data security safeguards that are consistent with our business operations and generally accepted industry standards to protect user information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us and you agree that you provide this information and engage in such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive information from you, we will endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.

We do this by:

  * Establishing policies and procedures for securely managing information;
  * Limiting employee access to sensitive information;
  * Protecting against unauthorized access to customer data by using data encryption, authentication and virus detection technology, as required;
  * Requiring service providers with whom we do business to comply with relevant Data Privacy legal and regulatory requirements;
  * Monitoring our websites through recognized online privacy and security organizations;
  * Conducting background checks on employees and providing Data Privacy training to our team members;
  * Continually assessing our Data Privacy, information management and data security practices; and
  * Using secure socket layers (SSL) encryption for sensitive communication over the Web for pages including login, account and order processing.
