This site may provide links to third party websites that may employ different information management practices. We encourage you to carefully read the online privacy notices of these other websites to ensure that you understand their practices and the relevant distinctions.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

DBEB collects information on businesses and business professionals. We collect identifiable business information from website visitors when they decide to apply for a D&B D-U-N-S® Number, register for a newsletter or e-mail alert, fill-out an optional survey, enter information onto an online form, or purchase a product or service online. We may also collect information offline from business owners, principals, and third parties, from businesses’ creditors, vendors and suppliers, and from public records such as business registrations, Uniform Commercial Code filings and bankruptcy filings. The business information that we collect includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:

Company and business professional contact information, including name, title, address, phone number, fax number, e-mail address and trade associations;

Detailed company profiles and statistics, including number of employees;

Background information regarding company management, such as the educational and career histories of company principals;

Company operational histories, including territories, subsidiaries, affiliates, and lines of business;

Detailed trade and business credit information, including payment histories and patterns;

Summary business information regarding profitability, debts, assets, net worth, and business relationships;

Business compliance information from public source government and professional records, media and business publications;

IP addresses, comments on social media and other information that is collected and used to analyze trends and to aggregate information regarding DBEB products and services;

Credit/debit card information in order to process certain customer payments.

We also collect information about website visitors indirectly through standard web logs, such as IP addresses, browser types (e.g. Internet Explorer), areas of the website that are visited, and the website from which a visitor came. We routinely use this web log information in the aggregate in order to administer and improve our website. While some of this information may be traceable to an individual, we only seek to identify individuals whom we believe are using our website for improper purposes or to otherwise use the information as described in this policy.

We also analyze IP addresses of visitors to our websites and match business information from our various databases and received from third parties against the IP addresses to learn more about what types of businesses are visiting our websites and the browsing preferences of such businesses on our websites.  We use the information derived from these analytical activities, which may be combined with non-personally identifiable behavioral information received from third parties, to better model and refine our general marketing activities and may, from time to time and to the extent permitted by law, directly market our products and services to these businesses based on the information we have learned about their browsing activities while on our websites.

   DBEB does not respond to Do Not Track Signals. 

**How Do We Use and Share Information?**

DBEB uses the identifiable business and business professional information that we collect to contact customers in order to offer customers a variety of business information products and services for use in making business credit, risk management, supplier, and marketing decisions. DBEB also licenses professional business contact information to authorized resellers and third party businesses for marketing and data management purposes.

We may use your professional business contact information to match it with other public and private data sources in order to create anonymous segments of information (this is non-personally identifying information, such as demographic, behavioral and technical information, extracted from the underlying data) for use by Dun & Bradstreet and/or third parties to target advertising messages to you on third party sites and services.  Such segments do not reveal or contain your personal information. You may opt-out from certain targeting advertising by following the instructions in the section below entitled “Third Party Advertisers.”  Dun & Bradstreet complies with the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising as administered by the Digital Advertising Alliance. Visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ to exercise your option to opt-out of targeted ads provided by certain listed companies.

DBEB shares data with third party service providers, such as credit card processors, live help/chat providers auditors, attorneys, consultants and contractors, in order to support DBEB’s Internet websites and business operations. DBEB contractually requires that these recipients only use the Data for the intended purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the Data when it is no longer needed. We may also disclose Data as required or appropriate in order to protect our website, business operations or legal rights, or in connection with a sale or merger involving DBEB assets (including information collected from you) or businesses. From time to time, DBEB compiles online and offline transaction and registration information for internal analyses, such as market research, quality assurance, customer experience, and operational benchmarking initiatives.

Accountability for Onward transfer:  When information is shared with third parties, we require contracts with those third parties that include limitation on use, provisions regarding compliance with comparable standards of security and data handling procedures as Dun & Bradstreet provides. Dun & Bradstreet remains liable for meeting the Privacy Principles if third-party agents that it engages to process personal data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Principles, unless Dun & Bradstreet can prove that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation. Dun & Bradstreet employs quality assurance measures during collection and processing to produce high-quality data.  Information is used in a manner that is compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or authorized. 

Also, be advised that Dun & Bradstreet sometimes receives requests (e.g., court order, subpoena, law enforcement proceeding) for personal information from public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Adherence to these Principles is limited (a) to the extent necessary to meet national security, public interest, or law enforcement requirements or (b) by statute, government regulation or case law that creates conflicting obligations or explicit authorizations.

**Collection of Sensitive Personally Identifiable Information**

DBEB may collect sensitive personally identifiable information (“SPI”) associated with certain customers or customers’ clients, such as individuals’ Social Security Numbers and dates of birth, in order to provide certain product and service offerings, such as verification status through our VERIFIED product. We will only collect this SPI if it is necessary to fulfill certain product orders and only when voluntarily provided by the customer, we will only use it for the limited, permissible purpose for which it is collected and we will take commercially reasonable steps to adequately secure the information. For more information regarding our data security practices, please review the “Data Security” section below. We may also share this SPI with trusted third parties for the limited, permissible purpose of fulfilling the associated product orders.

**Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixel Tags and GIFs**

We design the layout and features of our website so that new visitors may anonymously learn about our products and services without revealing their identities. For new visitors, we use first party cookies or Web beacons (placed on your browser by DBEB) to collect limited data, such as the date, time, and areas of our website that are visited, as well as the website from which the new visitor came. We may use IP addresses to derive certain other information concerning businesses visiting our websites as described in this policy, but we do not analyze this information in a way which would reveal the identity of the individual browsing our websites. When you select one of our products or services, register for a newsletter or e-mail alert, fill out an online form, or complete a survey, we may try to identify your browser and we may combine information from cookies, Web beacons, code and other information collected online with other data that we maintain about you. By improving the features, marketing, and content of our website and by making your online experience more convenient and meaningful, we are able to better serve our customers’ needs.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive and that often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that website’s computer asks your computer for permission to store this text file in a section of your hard drive that is specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it. Your browser will only permit a website to access the cookies that it has previously sent to you and not the cookies sent to you by other websites. Some of our business partners, such as third party advertisers, use cookies that originate from their websites. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies. For more information, please see the “Third Party Advertisers” section below. We use cookies to store login or other information on your computer, which serves to improve our website functionality and tailor our services to your preferences and interests. For certain services, we offer users the ability to store a user ID or password within a cookie so that they do not need to re-enter it when they subsequently return to our website. Cookies, in conjunction with our Web server’s log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and to assess which parts of the site are most popular. This information helps us to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers and some of our cookies may be tied to personally identifiable information. We do not store credit/debit card numbers in cookies.

Most Internet browsers allow users to decide whether to accept cookies and how long to keep them on their hard drive. You may reset your browser to refuse cookies and still use our website, although website access and functionality may be slower and less convenient.  
We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to display content based upon what you view on our site to personalize your visit. Third Parties, with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how Data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118).

A Web beacon is a graphic image, such as a pixel tag or clear GIF, which is placed on a Web page or in an e-mail message to monitor user activity, such as whether the Web page or e-mail message is accessed or clicked. They are often invisible because they are very small in size. They are also used on many Web pages for alignment purposes. We sometimes use Web beacons to provide an independent accounting of how many people visit our website or to gather statistics about browser usage on our website. Some of our Web pages and HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters use Web beacons in conjunction with cookies. It is difficult for you to limit the use of Web beacons because there is no easy way to distinguish their use from alignment and other purposes. Web beacons may also be loaded from a different Web server than the rest of the page.

Some of our e-mails may also contain pixels or code to gather information regarding e-mail behavior and analytics. We may share this encrypted information with third parties for e-mail analytics purposes. 

We use third party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. In the course of serving advertisements, our third party advertisers and partners may place or recognize a unique third party cookie on your browser. These companies may use information about your visits to [http://www.DandB.com](http://www.dandb.com/), [http://smallbusiness.dnb.com](http://smallbusiness.dnb.com/), [http://www.credibilitylive.com](http://www.credibilitylive.com/), [http://www.accesstocapital.com](http://www.accesstocapital.com/), and other Websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. These third party partners monitor how guests use our website and determine which of our online features they prefer. We may report information to our partners about our customers and the products and services they order, as well as aggregated, non-identifiable information about our guests’ use of our website. For more information, please see the “Third Party Advertisers” section below.

**Third Party Advertisers**

The use of third party cookies and other tracking technologies is not covered by our privacy policy.  We do not have access to or control of any third party tracking technologies. We use third party advertising companies to serve our Internet ad banners on our website and other websites on which we advertise. Our third party advertisers may also use a third party analytics provider to place third party cookies on your browser in order to collect anonymous and aggregated session Data, such as the ads that are viewed. If you view a Web page where our ads appear, the advertising company may place a cookie on your computer or use a Web beacon to access a cookie that they previously placed on your computer. These companies do not collect information that can personally identify you, but they may use information about your visits to our website and other websites to measure the effectiveness of ads. We do not disclose any personally identifiable information to these companies. We share aggregate website usage information with third party advertisers and partners for the purpose of effectively targeting our online advertisements. Unless you are previously notified, these advertising companies do not link any online behavior or cookies with other information that can be used to personally identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address, when working with DBEB.

These third party advertising networks also track visitors’ online usage and behavior patterns. These companies may use information about your visits to the Websites and other websites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. The result of these efforts is the creation of an online profile that attempts to predict individual user interests, preferences and purchasing habits. The third party advertising networks then accordingly customize the advertising content served to users when visiting other websites.

The _Network Advertising Initiative_ (NAI) is a self-regulatory cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies. The NAI provides educational content and opt-out tools to help Internet users learn about and address online behavioral marketing practices. Through the NAI’s online options, you may opt out of particular NAI network members’ behavioral advertising programs or you may opt out of all NAI network members’ programs. Opting out will prevent the given network from which you opted out from using your Web preferences and usage patterns to deliver targeted online ads. The NAI opt-out only works with participating third party advertising networks that use cookies and Web beacons to execute their advertising initiatives. If you would like additional information about online behavioral marketing and your options regarding these standard Internet practices, please visit the NAI website.
