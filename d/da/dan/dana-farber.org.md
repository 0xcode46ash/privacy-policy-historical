**Dana-Farber Privacy Statement**

Your privacy is important to us, so we operate the site by the following principles:

  * **Confidentiality**  
You may use our site without disclosing personally identifiable information. We want to be clear that we will not obtain such information about you unless you choose to submit it to us. If you supply personally identifiable information (such as name, address or telephone numbers) for various purposes on this site, we only use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information you have requested). 
  * **Security**  
Dana-Farber takes every precaution to protect our usersâ€™ information. When a registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or diagnosis), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry- SSL. 

Should you electronically request a referral to a Dana-Farber physician, we will use the information you submit to arrange for care where appropriate. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off line. Our software and hardware is configured to provide maximum security. 

  * **Cookies**  
The Dana-Farber Web sites use cookies to track traffic coming to our site. In this tracking, we do not collect personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail, or mailing address. Cookies will also be used to identify a person who chooses to register on our site. If you choose to register on our site and are given a password for an event, give donations on line, or choose to enroll in our e-mail subscription services, we will identify you with cookies. You will always have a chance to opt out at any time. 
  * **Information Collection and Use**  
Dana-Farber is the sole owner of the personal medical information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others. Dana-Farber occasionally trades its contributor mailing lists with other non-profit organizations. This process saves us money and is carefully monitored.
