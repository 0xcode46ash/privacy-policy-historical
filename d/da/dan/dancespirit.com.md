#### About Information We Collect

Macfadden Performing Arts Media collects two types of information about our visitors: (1) aggregated (collective) data that tracks visitors as a group, and (2) individual user data that is volunteered. 

#### Aggregated Data

Macfadden Performing Arts Media gathers aggregated data to monitor visitor activity on the site as a whole. This data does not identify you personally. Aggregated tracking allows us to monitor traffic on the site to determine which areas of Macfadden Performing Arts Media are most attractive to visitors. This type of information helps us to make improvements and to add new features and services based on visitor interests. We may disclose this aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners. 

#### Individual User Data 

We request individual user data when you voluntarily register onsite for personalized services, or when you register for contests, sweepstakes, or other promotional programs. For example, we may require you to provide us with certain information such as a user ID, password, e-mail address, or date of birth. Except as explained below, this information will not be disclosed to parties other than Macfadden Performing Arts Media in any way that personally identifies you, without prior notification. 

If you are under 13 years old, under no circumstances should you send us any personally identifying information. 

#### How We Collect Information 

Like most other websites, Macfadden Performing Arts Media's servers automatically track certain information about your activity. This information includes:

  * the browser you are using
  * your IP address 
  * the referring URL and all Macfadden Performing Arts Media URLs you visit 



#### Cookies

We use cookies on certain pages of our site to help us establish traffic patterns on Macfadden Performing Arts Media sites. One way that cookies are used is to allow you to store your user name and password without having to frequently reenter it during a session. Cookies also help us tailor content, special features and marketing messages that match your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on Macfadden Performing Arts Media's servers. You are always free to set your browser to decline our cookies and you can delete cookies on your computer. However if you do so, you may find that some areas of our site may not work properly and you will be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session. 

Macfadden Performing Arts Media places advertising on our site that originates from the outside advertiser or its agency. At times, the advertiser may assign a cookie if you click on its banner or ad. Macfadden Performing Arts Media does not control these cookies. Again, cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on Macfadden Performing Arts Media's servers. 

#### How We Use Information We Collect

Except as described below, we do not provide your personally identifiable information to anyone outside of Macfadden Performing Arts Media. However, on certain pages, such as contests, we may collect your volunteered personally identifiable data. We will explicitly tell you that the data you give us will be shared with third parties, such as an advertiser. Such disclosures will override anything to the contrary stated in this policy. 

#### Macfadden Performing Arts Media Content Providers & Advertisers

We do not give your personal information to anyone outside of Macfadden Performing Arts Media except in limited circumstances mentioned above, such as contests, and then only with your consent. However, Macfadden Performing Arts Media sites contain links to other sites and those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as Macfadden Performing Arts Media. For example, when you click on an ad on a Macfadden Performing Arts Media site or purchase a product using links on Macfadden Performing Arts Media Marketplace, this can take you away from our site to the advertiser's site. These links include advertisers, content providers, retailers and business partners who may use the Macfadden Performing Arts Media logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and ask for personal information. 

If you have provided personal information to a company or advertiser that is linked to Macfadden Performing Arts Media and have not been informed by Macfadden Performing Arts Media as to how such information will be used, or if you want to understand the privacy practices of such company or advertiser, you should contact that company or advertiser directly. You can do this by going to their website's home page and looking for a company profile or contact information area on the site. 

#### Contests and Other Promotions

To participate in contests and other promotions offered on Macfadden Performing Arts Media sites, you are asked to provide certain personal information on a voluntary basis. The contest rules are prominently posted during the duration of the event, including how data gathered from entrants will be used. All contests are conducted in full accordance with U.S. federal and state laws. 

If you are under 13 years old, under no circumstances should you send us any personally identifying information. 

#### Data Security

Macfadden Performing Arts Media employs industry-standard practices for safeguarding the personal information of our visitors. Database security and web server encryption (Secure Socket Layers) for transactions in our online store are standard practices on Macfadden Performing Arts Media sites.
