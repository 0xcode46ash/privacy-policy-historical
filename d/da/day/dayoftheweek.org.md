You are not required to provide an email address to personalize your web experience.
  * When you visit our website, we place a small text file called a “cookie” on your computer that allows us to identify your web browser.

We will, therefore, disclose information, including cookies, in response to a request from law enforcement officials or as otherwise required by law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect someone’s safety, or enforce our Terms of Service.
  * If we decide to materially change this privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on this page.
