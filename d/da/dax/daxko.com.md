# DAXKO Shared Technology - Web-based Online Registration and Member Management Solutions

|     
**Privacy Policy** **Data Ownership**  
DAXKO services are designed to provide confidential online registration and payment processing, Web site design and hosting, and membership management to credible organizations, not to serve as façades for collecting private consumer data for re-sale or sharing.

All participant data for online registrations and membership management is solely and exclusively owned by the respective organization providing such service through DAXKO. As part of our commitment to participants’ privacy, DAXKO relinquishes rights to disclose any personal information provided by the participants.

DAXKO will not sell, give, lend or otherwise provide personal data from any organization to any company, institution, individual or other entity other than the account administrator of the particular organization.

 **Data Encryption During Transmission**  
DAXKO is committed to providing the highest level of security to all data transactions conducted through use of our site. Our Internet professionals utilize the latest security technologies and adhere to strict internal security procedures to ensure the maximum safety, privacy and security of personal and financial information during all stages of the process.

Transmission of personal information, payment information and all other data provided by users is protected by SSL 128-bit encryption, and all data stored on our servers is safeguarded using the latest security technologies.

 **Data Storage**  
All registration and membership data is securely stored within a large-scale database management system. Our servers are physically located in a secure data center, a protected building with extensive security features including biometric palm readers, video monitoring and card key access.

The data center also includes extensive fault tolerant systems for power, including backup diesel generators and quadruple redundant Internet lines. In addition, DAXKO’s servers are configured and tested regularly by certified “ethical hackers” to ensure that no security loopholes in our system architecture exist.

 **Personally Identifiable Information**  
When using DAXKO to register for a membership, event or donation to an organization, you will be asked to submit “personally identifiable information” during the course of that process.

The number and nature of requests for this personally identifiable information are determined by the organization hosting the membership, event or donation. The questions are designed by the organization to fulfill the event or service for which you are registering and can be optional or required. Questions designated as requiring an answer are denoted by a red asterisk and are designated as required by the organization, not DAXKO.

 **Access To and Use of Personally Identifiable Information**  
DAXKO does not engage in the sale or distribution of personally identifiable information for direct marketing, sales or other purposes. Your personally identifiable information is stored securely by DAXKO and is accessible only to administrators of the organization with whom you are signing up and to appropriate employees of DAXKO, for purposes of rendering the requested service for which you completed the form. In addition to pledging that DAXKO will not use your personally identifiable information for uses other than those defined within this statement, DAXKO requires that all organizations using our systems agree to our Operating Terms and Conditions. This agreement stipulates that the organization will also abide by these restrictions on the collection and usage of your personally identifiable information.

DAXKO will occasionally use aggregate information to produce reports tracking usage trends on the site and to improve site design. We will not use data for this or any other purpose in a way that would risk the privacy of personally identifiable information.

 **Security of Personally Identifiable Information**  
DAXKO has taken every step to ensure that your data is secure and private during the process. Your data is encrypted and transmitted using Secure Socket Layering (SSL) and is then stored and protected in a secure storage facility. **Usage of Cookies**  
DAXKO uses "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if an administrator logs in with his user name and password, a cookie helps DAXKO to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information each visit. When you return to the same DAXKO Web site, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience all the features of DAXKO’s services.

 **Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
DAXKO will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. All participant data is solely and exclusively owned by the respective organization providing service through DAXKO. As part of our commitment to participants’ privacy, DAXKO relinquishes rights to disclose any personal information provided by participants.

Your mailing address will be shared with your credit card company in order to verify that you are an authorized user. Your telephone number will be used if there are any customer service issues that might need to be addressed.

DAXKO will not sell, give, lend or otherwise provide personal data from any organization’s accounts to any company, institution, individual or other entity other than the account administrator of the particular organization.

 **E-mail communications from our site**  
Your e-mail address is stored so that we can send the account administrator your user name and password in case you forget or lose it. Depending on the client organization they might send special announcements and reminders relevant to the event you are attending only. DAXKO will not send end users of client organizations any unsolicited information, including e-mail.

New client organizations will receive a DAXKO welcome letter explaining the features provided by the services. DAXKO will also send periodic client letters to announce important service changes, new features, technical issue updates and news about other DAXKO products and services, which you may opt out of by contacting your account manager. DAXKO may also contact you to conduct research about your opinion of current and prospective services via optional e-mail surveys.

 **Opting Out of Optional E-mail Communications**  
As an end user or client of DAXKO’s services, you have the ability at any time to opt out of optional e-mail communications by contacting the administrator of the particular organization holding the DAXKO account. **Testimonials**  
Testimonials appearing on any of DAXKO’s Web sites are the personal opinions and comments of existing clients and are of no liability to DAXKO. **Third party services**  
If you pay online for a membership, event or donation, credit card funds are processed through Verisign (http://www.verisign.com). Verisign will transmit the transaction information you provide to transaction processors and merchant banks. By registering online you agree that DAXKO will, if a credit card transaction is selected, provide your information to Verisign, its transaction processors and merchant banks. Verisign has implemented security systems consisting of encryption and "Firewall" technologies for the transmission of information over the Internet. Neither DAXKO nor Verisign, however, guarantees that such security is secure or impregnable and neither DAXKO nor Verisign will be responsible in the event of infiltration of Verisign's security systems. Neither DAXKO nor Verisign is responsible for the security of transmission data or information or any other information stored on DAXKO's servers, our licensed partner's servers, or any other party's servers. **Changes/Updates**  
As an end user of DAXKO’s services, you have the ability at any time to change any of your personal information by contacting the administrator of the particular organization holding the DAXKO account. **Participant Information**  
By executing our Operating Terms when creating a DAXKO account, you agree to treat all information or material transmitted by participants to you confidentially and not to use that information, without their prior written consent, for any other purpose other than in connection with providing the services to the participant for which they registered. **Organization Information**  
In order to process your organization’s request for an account, DAXKO requires the organization’s name, contact’s name, contact’s phone number, contact’s e-mail address and the physical address of the organization.

To expedite communication between DAXKO and your organization, you should also provide the contact’s job title, fax number and the organization’s Web site. Entering this information is optional and omitting it will not adversely effect your organization’s account application.

 **Access To and Use of Organization Information**  
All information submitted by your organization to the site [**www.DAXKO.com**](http://www.daxko.com/) is collected and housed by DAXKO in our secure data storage facility. DAXKO does not engage in the sale or redistribution of individually identifiable information collected from your organization through our site.

We will occasionally use aggregate data collected through our site to produce generalized reports, but we will not use the data in a way that would expose an organization’s identity. We will share aggregate demographic information with our client organizations. Individually identifiable information is used internally by DAXKO only to create and manage your account and is not shared with any other entity.

 **Security of Organization Information**  
DAXKO has taken every step to ensure that your data is secure and private during the online process. Your data is encrypted and transmitted using 128-bit Secure Socket Layering (SSL) and is then stored and protected in a secure storage facility. **Changing Your Organization Information**  
If you would like to review or change the information submitted to DAXKO, log on with your user name and password, and then select Manage Account from the menu. **Changes to the Privacy Policy**  
If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via e-mail. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices. **Questions About the Privacy Policy**  
We encourage you to contact us with any questions or comments regarding our policy.
