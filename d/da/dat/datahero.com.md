# Privacy | DataHero

#### Effective Date: April 2013

##### Your privacy is important to us.

We want you to feel confident when using DataHero and comfortable with how your data is used.

  * We believe in _being transparent_ about the information we collect and how we use it.
  * We believe that _you should have control_ over the data you upload into DataHero. We will never share your data without your permission (unless required by law) and will provide you with a clear means to be able to delete your data from our systems.
  * We believe that having access to your data is a privilege. If you provide DataHero with credentials for a third-party service, we pledge to only use those credentials to list the data that you have available in that service and that _we will not upload anything into DataHero without your permission_.



By using this service, you agree to allow us to collect and process information as described below. If you have any questions or believe that data has been uploaded into DataHero that shouldn't have been, please contact us at [privacy@datahero.com](mailto:privacy@datahero.com).

COLLECTION: We collect three types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This information is used to enable DataHero functionality and to better allow us to understand how visitors navigate our website.

  * Purchase Information: If you purchase paid features of DataHero, we collect your name, billing and shipping address, credit card information and any other information necessary to complete the transaction.
  * Log-in Information: If you create a DataHero account, you provide your email address, name and create a password that we store so you can access and use DataHero.
  * Website Use Information: Like many websites, we use tools (including Google Analytics) to collect information from visitors in order to better understand how they use our website (e.g., browser type, domains, page views). We use session cookies to keep you logged in while you use features of our web application; these disappear after you close your browser. We also use persistent cookies which stay in your browser and allow us to recognize you when you return to the site. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change the settings to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you turn off cookies, parts of DataHero may not work for you.



TRANSFER: We do not rent or sell our customer lists. We may share your personally identifiable information with third parties for purposes of providing you with the DataHero services. These third parties may use your information to perform the services, and to offer you other products or services that may be of interest to you. Except as described herein, DataHero will only provide information collected on the website to a third party if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.

SECURITY: DataHero takes security seriously. We use commercially standard methods to transmit your data securely including HTTPS, SSL, and 128bit encryption. The data is stored using Amazonâ€™s S3 AND RDS cloud services.

International Visitors: DataHero is hosted in the United States and is intended for United States visitors. If you are accessing the site from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring your personal data to the United States and by providing your personal data you consent to that transfer.

Business Transitions: Upon the sale or transfer of the company and its assets, we will require a purchaser to treat our data under the privacy statement in place at the time of its collection.

Changes to Privacy Policy: Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. If we decide to change our privacy policy, then we will post those changes to this Privacy Notice, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
