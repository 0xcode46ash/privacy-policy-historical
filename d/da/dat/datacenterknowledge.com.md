  * _November 12th, 2008 : Rich Miller_

**Privacy Policy and Terms of Service**

Data Center Knowledge is committed to ensuring the privacy of its visitors and registered members and wants you to fully understand our terms and conditions. This privacy statement describes how any personal, and anonymous, information is collected and managed and how you can request changes to any sharing of this information that may occur.

Data Center Knowledge’ servers automatically recognize a visitor’s IP address and domain name. These items do not reveal any personally identifiable information about you. The information is used to compile statistics that enable us to study page impression levels and unique users visiting to the site. This information helps us to understand the areas of our sites that people visit in order to deliver better content and site navigation.

**Cookies**

Like most sites, Data Center Knowledge uses cookies. Cookies are small data files that some Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you’ve visited. Cookies do not tell us who you are unless you’ve specifically given us personally identifiable information. A cookie can’t read data off your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites.

Cookies allow a publisher to provide automatic logins to improve your experience with our sites. For example, we may use a cookie to identify our registered members so they don’t have to re-enter a user id and password when they sign-in or comment on articles or in forums. Cookies can also be used to help us to better understand how visitors interact with our sites leading to the delivery of more relevant content, or they can be used to control the number of times an advertisement is served to the same visitor. Cookies may be created directly by our sites for these purposes, or by third-party companies operating on our behalf. Some of our advertisers occasionally serve you cookies as well. We do not have control over cookies placed by advertisers.

Among our advertisers serving cookies is Google, which uses the DoubleClick DART cookie to serve ads to our users based on their visits to Data Center Knowledge and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis.

[**Pixel Tags**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel%20Tags)

Data Center Knowledge may also use pixel tags, also known as beacons, web bugs or clear gifs, to improve our understanding of site traffic, visitor behavior, and response to promotional campaigns. A Pixel tag is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a Web page or e-mail containing it.

**Online Ad Serving**

When you visit our Web sites, Data Center Knowledge uses third-party advertising companies to serve some or all of the advertisements on our sites, and, in some cases, in our newsletters. Often, these third-party advertising companies may employ cookie and pixel tag technologies to measure the advertisements’ effectiveness. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to our and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may interest you. As part of our relationship with such companies, we do not provide them any personally identifiable information.

**Protecting Your Information**

Data Center Knowledge never shares your personal information with anyone without your permission. For example, some free content available to our subscribers, such as white papers and research reports, requires that you share specific personal information with the publisher or sponsor of that content. In such instances, you are notified before you download or view the content of the specific information required and of exactly who will receive it.

By subscribing to Data Center Knowledge you implicitly give us permission to share your information with vendors who are essential in the delivery of services and features included in your subscription. For example, our Web-hosting and e-mail delivery vendors may need to store your information on their servers while helping us send you your weekly newsletters. However, these essential vendors will use your personal information only as needed to deliver products and services which you have requested from Data Center Knowledge.

The necessary disclosure of any of the above information to third parties will be governed by the following principles:

    * 1\. Where Data Center Knowledge is required to do so by law and any order of the court.
    * 2\. Where Data Center Knowledge intends to co-operate with the investigation of any alleged unlawful activities without being required to by virtue of any court order or other legal requirement.
    * 3\. Where it is necessary to protect the rights of Data Center Knowledge, its employees or members.

**Newsletters**

Through the registration process for any Data Center Knowledge Newsletter, we request some personal information such as your e-mail address, etc. We will never give your personal information to any third party vendor without your prior consent. We may, however, make our email and postal lists available, on a rental basis, to carefully screened providers of related goods and services. These activities help us to pay for the daily information we provide on Data Center Knowledge web site. If you do not wish to receive information from third party vendors, please use the unsubscribe link provided in the email.

Occasionally, Data Center Knowledge conducts user surveys to better understand the needs of our audience in order to improve our features. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any information about specific individuals with any third party without the user’s consent.

**Security**

We use all reasonable precautions to securely maintain all information given to us by our registered members and we are not responsible for any breach of the reasonable security measures installed to protect the said information.
