# DateHookup.com Privacy Policy

Effective as of: August 10th, 2012 

We recognize that privacy is important. Below are some common questions and answers related to how we handle privacy. 

**What kind of information is collected on this site?**

When you join DateHookup.com, you will have to submit certain personal information, such as an email address, your gender, age, and other information that a typical dating site would need. Your email address is always private and never shared with anyone. Other information that you submit will be available on your profile, as one would expect ;-) 

**Do you share my info with other companies?**

We don't give, sell, or share any information you submit to us to third parties, unless requested by police or required by law or unless necessary to provide our services to you. 

Your information may be transferred to our contractors in connection with the provision of our services to you or where it is otherwise necessary to meet the purpose for which you have submitted your information. 

**Why do you need my email address?**

We require your email address so we can alert you of new messages, winks, friend requests, new singles in your area, etc. We do not abuse this feature, as our goal is to never annoy our users. There is an unsubscribe link on every email we send so you can stop receiving emails anytime with the click of a button. 

**Regarding advertisements on this site**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Information sent is always aggregated. For example, we might offer advertisers the ability to advertise to age groups such as 18-30. If you fell into this age range, you would be in this group and might receive ads targeted to your age group. None of your personal information is used directly, it's grouped with thousands of other members. Google is our ad vendor. For more information about how Google serves ads, please [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

**Can I hide or remove my profile from DateHookup.com?**

You can set your profile to 'invisible' any time you want. This will make it so no one can see your profile. You can set it back to visible at any time. You can also cancel your account at any time. This will completely delete your profile from our system. We don't try to make it impossible to delete yourself like some other sites might, deleting your account takes just 3 clicks from anywhere on the site. But you won't want to leave, this place is too much fun! 

**Do you use cookies?**

We use cookies to enable the functions on this site to work. Without them DateHookup.com would not function, so in order to use this site please have cookies enabled. Cookies are just small text files that reside on your computer. Sites will store session information in cookies in order to know whether you are logged in, etc. They are private. 

**Links**

When browsing this site, you may encounter links that point to other sites. This could be in the form of advertising, or links that users might put in their profiles. DateHookup.com is not affiliated with these sites and has no liability for them. When you link to other third party websites, our privacy practices no longer apply. We encourage visitors to review each site's privacy policy before disclosing any personal data. 

**Communication with other members**

Communication with other members on this site is handled through our messaging and instant messaging systems. Your email address is never used for communication and remains private at all times. The only personal information that is available to other members is what you have in your profile or what you give them. 

**Security**

We have implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personal information that we collect from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction. In particular, all appropriate confidentiality obligations and technical and organizational security measures are in place to protect against unauthorized or unlawful disclosure or processing of such personal information and the accidental loss or destruction of or damage to such personal data. In compliance with applicable law, we will promptly notify those persons whose personal data has been compromised, in accordance with the notification procedures in this Privacy Statement or as otherwise required. 

**Notification procedures**

It is our policy to provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to our users via e-mail notice, written or hard copy notice, or through conspicuous posting of such notice on the 'My Home' page, as determined by us in our sole discretion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we reserve the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to our site users. 

**Access to personal data**

If you would like to update any personal information you have submitted to us, please do so via your profile page or account options. 

**Modifications**

We reserve the right to modify or amend this Privacy Policy at any time. The effective date will be displayed at the beginning of this policy. To keep visitors informed, we will notify users of material changes to our Privacy Policy by identifying the update on the 'My Home' page of DateHookup.com.
