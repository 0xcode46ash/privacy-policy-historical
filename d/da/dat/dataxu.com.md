### Why Do We Collect And Use Information?

Advertising supports free content and experiences we all love on the web. Our goal is to make advertising more effective, because relevant ads are less annoying, and help the services which depend on advertising, because advertisers pay more for effective ads.

### What Types of Information Do We Collect and Use?

We do not collect or use personally identifiable information. We do not collect your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, Social Security Number, credit card information, or anything else that can personally identify you.

We collect only anonymous, non-personally identifiable information, such as browser type (e.g., Firefox or Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Macintosh or Windows), Internet provider (e.g., Verizon or Comcast), IP address, and whether you respond to an ad.

### What Technology Do We Use to Collect Information? 

We use two technologies to collect information, both of which are widely used on the Internet: 

#### Cookies

Cookies are small text files that web sites place in your browser when you visit them or see an ad. When you return to the site or view another ad, a site can access these cookie files. Sites can then determine how often you’ve visited a site or seen an ad. Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on your computer.

#### Pixel Tags

Pixel tags are small images on a Web page or other document. Pixel tags allow the operator of the Web page or other document, or a third party who serves the pixel tag, to set, read, and modify cookies.

#### Opting Out

There are two ways you can opt-out of DataXu ad optimization:

  1. Block all cookies by disabling cookie use in your browser. This may cause some sites to work incorrectly. 
  2. Opt out by setting a cookie which tells the DataXu system to ignore you.

If you change computers or browsers, or use multiple computers or browsers or delete your cookies, you will need to repeat this process for each computer and in each browser.

### Data Storage and Security

We retain the Non-Personally Identifiable Information collected via our technology for up to 180 days. After 180 days, we discard the information.

Even though our information is anonymous, security is important to us. We have implemented reasonable measures to protect the information we collect. No method protecting information is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Adult Use

Our products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under the age of 18. If we are made aware that we have received such information, or any information in violation of our policy, we will use reasonable efforts to locate and remove that information from our records.

### Disclosures

Some of our web site partners may place their own cookies on your Internet browser outside of our service; however, we have no access to or control over these cookies. 

In the event another company acquires all or most of our assets, all data compiled or owned by us may be among the items transferred in that transaction. In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this Policy.

We may transmit or share our data with third-party service providers (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) in order for those service providers to perform business functions for us or on our behalf.

We may share, in an aggregated format, the non-Personally Identifiable Information we collect to do business with related third parties, such as our advertising clients.

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We may revise this Policy at any time. We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review any changes. All updates to our policy are posted on this portion of our web site. To download this policy, select Save from your browser’s menu.
