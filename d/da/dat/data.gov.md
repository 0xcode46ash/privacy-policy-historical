# Data.gov - Privacy Policy

Data.gov is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to this website. Data.gov does not collect personal information when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information. Outlined below is the Data.gov online privacy policy. If you have questions about this policy, [please let us know](https://web.archive.org/contact). 

##  Information Collected and Stored Automatically 

When you visit Data.gov, we may store some or all of the following: the Internet address from which you access Data.gov, date and time, the Internet address of the website from which you linked to Data.gov, the name of the file or words you searched, items clicked on a page, and the browser and operating system used. 

This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various sections of our site and identify system performance or problem areas. We also use this information to help us develop the site, analyze patterns of usage, and to make the site more useful. This information is not used for associating search terms or patterns of site navigation with individual users. Data.gov periodically deletes its Web logs. On occasion, Data.gov may provide this information to third party entities it contracts with for the purposes of research analysis. 

##  Cookies 

When you visit some websites, their web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies. Cookies are commonly used to recognize your computer in the future. 

Data.gov uses per-session cookies to serve technical purposes, like providing seamless navigation through Data.gov. These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer’s hard drive. Data.gov’s session cookies are available only during an active browser session. When you close your browser, the session cookie disappears. 

Data.gov also uses persistent cookies to be able to track the number of unique visitors to the site. 

Users can choose to disable cookies using their web browsers. It will not affect their ability to search for, review and retrieve data on the site. 

##  Personal Information 

Users are NOT required to provide any information to search, retrieve, download, filter and otherwise use the data available on Data.gov. There are some optional uses of Data.gov that require a user account. They include participation in some Data.gov Communities, commenting on blog posts or datasets, suggesting datasets, and saving specific views created by the user on the Data.gov platform. If you choose to use these options, you need to create a user account by providing an email address and user name. Email addresses are not made public and are used for authentication only. If you choose to provide us with personal information—like filling out a [Contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact) form with an email address and submitting it to us through the website—we use that information to respond to your message, and to help get you the information you requested. Your email address will not be stored or retrieved by Data.gov. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your question relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. Data.gov never collects information or creates individual profiles for commercial marketing. 

While you must provide an email address and user name for the optional uses of Data.gov, you should NOT include any other personal information, especially [Social Security numbers](http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10002.html#protect). 

Data.gov is NOT a Privacy Act System of Record. Submission of any information is voluntary, and the collection of email addresses is being done purely for the purpose of authentication. 

##  User Profiles and Online Comments 

Users creating accounts can pick any user name. It does not have to be the user’s real name or email address. Users have the option of uploading additional information such as an image, location, tags, and other social profiles. Providing additional information is entirely voluntary. 

Any comments you provide are categorized as public information. Compilations of your comments may be provided to national leaders (without email address) and other individuals participating in Data.gov efforts. Comments may also be made available online to the public without the use of any optionally provided email addresses, but with the user name. 

##  Browser Information Collected on the Website 

Ratings of datasets are collected to track the usefulness of certain datasets and improve the value of Data.gov. Data.gov does not gather, request, record, require, collect or track any Internet users’ personal information through these processes. 

##  Site Security 

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. 

Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines. 

Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act. 

A variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are maintained to protect information. For example, commercially reasonable tools and techniques are used to protect against unauthorized access to Data.gov systems. Data.gov has been Certified and Accredited (C&A) by the General Services Administration (GSA). Also, access to email received is restricted to those who need such access in the course of their duties for Data.gov. 

##  External Links 

Data.gov may contain links to websites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. Data.gov provides these links as a service to our users. When users link to an outside website, they are leaving the Data.gov site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website(s). You are encouraged to familiarize yourself with these policies. The Data.gov linking policy is the same as the [USA.gov Linking Policy](http://www.usa.gov/About/Linking_Policy.shtml). 

##  Children’s Privacy 

Data.gov complies with the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998](http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm) (COPPA) that helps to protect the safety and privacy of children online. COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation constitute United States Federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. Personal information from children under 13 is not knowingly collected, nor are children under 13 knowingly contacted by Data.gov. Data.gov does not intend to solicit information of any kind from children under 13. It is possible that Data.gov may receive emails pertaining to children under 13. If Data.gov is notified of this, as soon as the information is verified, parental consent will be immediately obtained or the email will be deleted from the email box servicing Data.gov. 

##  Prohibitions 

Data.gov will not link to any website that exhibits hate, bias, or discrimination. Data.gov reserves the right to deny or remove any link that contains misleading information or unsubstantiated claims, or is determined to be in conflict with Data.gov’s policies.
