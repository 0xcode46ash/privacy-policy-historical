DCD respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. We comply with the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998 and aim to maintain consistently high levels of best practice in our processing of your personal information. This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the DCD Group network of websites and/or other services provided by DCD or any company in the DCD Group of Companies.

In order to provide you with the full range of services, we may request and/or record information about you. This Privacy Policy explains the following:

  * **the type of information we collect;**
  * **how the information is used;**
  * **when we may contact you;**
  * **whether we will disclose your details to anyone else; and**
  * **the use of cookies.**



DCD´s websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to review them. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

**_2\. What type of personal information is collected?_**

When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from any DCD website, such as a newsletter or account creation we will ask for limited personal information. We will also collect personal information from you when you subscribe to our magazines and when you communicate with us over the telephone or via written correspondence. This can include information such as your name, postal address, telephone or mobile number, fax number, email address, gender or date of birth. By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable DCD to provide you with the services you select.

**_3\. How will the information be used?_**

DCD will use your personal information for a number of non-marketing purposes including the following:

  1. **We may contact you for service-related reasons that you have subscribed to, signed up for, or participate in (e.g. to make you aware of any changes in your subscription, reminding you of a password or username, or about a comment you have made on a website);**
  2. **To invite you to share your opinions and comments through a research study;**
  3. **To track traffic flows and to make our websites easier for you to use;**
  4. **To fulfil subscription orders;**
  5. **To provide a user online community; and for**
  6. **Planning and managing our business activities by understanding aggregated analysis on behaviour and habits;**



**_4\. Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?_**

Yes. DCD may use the information you have provided to promote the products and services of DCD or selected partners.

However, be assured that we understand the irritations of unsolicited communications and are fully committed to ensuring the rights and obligations set out in the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, as amended from time to time, are respected.

**If you don’t want it, you won’t get it**. Any marketing communication you receive will always include a clear, simple option to refuse, or ‘opt-out’ of such future communications.

The Telephone Preference Service (TPS) and the Mailing Preference Service (MPS) offer consumers important statutory and non-statutory protection against unsolicited marketing contact. If you are registered on either service, DCD will assume that your _subsequent_ submission of personal data via a DCD website or data capture form indicates, for the time being, your consent to receive marketing by us. **You may opt-out at ANY time by contacting us. Please see details at the end of this policy.**

**_5\. Will DCD share my information with anyone else?_**

DCD may share your data with other companies in the DCD Group of Companies, including our holding company and its subsidiaries. We may disclose your personal data where DCD believes it is compelled to do so by law; in particular for the prevention or detection of crime, the capture or prosecution of offenders; and the assessment or collection of tax or duty. We do not require any further consent from you in order to share your data in such circumstances and DCD will comply as required with any legally binding request that is made of it. In the event we propose to sell or buy any business assets or any part of our group of companies, we may disclose your personal data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets if relevant, but on a strictly confidential basis. We only ever disclose or share data within the bounds of the law.

Occasionally, we may share your contact information with carefully selected third party companies whose products and services we feel may be of interest to you. We will keep these offers relevant to your interests. It’s easy to unsubscribe from any email you no longer want. (see below).

Please note that some of our partners may be located outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Countries outside the EEA may not be required to protect personal information as stringently as countries inside.

We may compile and share statistics about the use of our websites including data on traffic, usage patterns, user numbers, sales and other information. All such data will be anonymised and will not include any personally identifying information.

**_6\. Can I find out what personal information DCD holds on me?_**

Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to request a copy of the personal information that DCD holds about you. There will be an administration fee of £10 associated with this request and we will require two pieces of identification to prove your identity. Please make a written application to the Data Protection Officer, Data Centre Dynamics Limited, 102-108 Clifton Street, London, EC2A 4HW.

If any of the personal information that we hold about you is incorrect, you can contact us at [info@datacenterdynamics.com](mailto:info@datacenterdynamics.com) and we will update your details as soon as practically possible.

**_7\. Changes to the DCD Privacy Policy?_**

This Privacy Policy may be updated at any time with or without notice in order to comply with new practices, regulations or the general law. Any changes will be immediately posted on our websites and you will be deemed to have accepted the terms of this Privacy Policy on your first use of any of our sites following the alterations.
