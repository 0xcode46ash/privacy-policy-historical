# Privacy Policy | Datto Backup

Datto, Inc. (“Datto”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting Personal Information that you provide to us. This statement explains our policies and practices regarding the use and disclosure of your Personal Information by Datto. By using the Datto website, you consent to the usage of your Personal Information by Datto as explained below.

### Personal Information

We use the term “Personal Information” to refer to information that, by itself, would permit someone to identify or contact you, such as your full name, address, telephone number, or email address. Personal Information does not include aggregated information that, by itself, does not permit the identification of individual persons. Our website does not collect any Personal Information about you other than the information that you intentionally submit to us by completing and sending a form on our website, by submitting email to us, or by logging onto one of the areas of our website that is restricted to registered users. Similarly, off-line, Datto will only collect Personal Information about you that you voluntarily submit.

### Use and Non-Disclosure of Personal Information

Datto may use this information internally in connection with processing your inquiries and orders or to help improve our products and services. Datto also may use your Personal Information for the purposes of supporting your relationship with Datto by designing content that is suitable to your needs and alerting you to new service offerings as they become available.

Datto may share your Personal Information with its parent company, subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively the “Datto family of companies.”) We would only share such information with third-parties outside the Datto family of companies with your express permission or as required by applicable law. Information is used solely for the purposes described here. Datto does not sell or trade Personal Information to third parties without your prior consent. If you decide that we should not use your Personal Information, please notify us and we will discontinue use.

If you provide Datto with especially sensitive information, such as a credit card number, transmission of sensitive data is encrypted and is protected by encryption software. We also restrict access to this sensitive information on our computers to employees who have a need to know the information.

### Collection of Non-Personal Data

When using Datto’s web page, Datto may collect limited non-personal identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a website. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your query. We use this information to understand how people interact with our website. Upon your first visit to Datto, a “cookie”, or small file containing a string of characters, may be sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Datto may store user preferences in cookies and track user trends and search patterns. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

### Datto’s Commitment to Security

Datto is concerned with the security of your information and is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect it from unauthorized access and use. To that end, we have established the appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial policies and procedures to secure this information. We bind our employees to observe your privacy and confidentiality rights.

### Special Circumstances of Disclosure

Except as provided above, Datto may only disclose information that you have furnished about yourself if Datto believes in good faith belief that such action is reasonably necessary: (1) to comply with the law; (2) to comply with legal process; (3) to enforce the Terms of Use; (4) to respond to claims that such content violates the rights of third-parties; (5) to protect the interests of Datto, or for a compelled public purpose such as national security or public safety.

### External Links

Datto’s website may provide links to third-party websites. Even if the third-party is affiliated with Datto through a business partnership or otherwise, Datto is not responsible for the content, privacy policies, or practices of such external links. External links are provided for convenience only and access to these links is at your own risk.

### Additional Terms of Use of Web Page

Please also see our Terms of Use, which describes the restrictions, disclaimers, indemnification, and limitation of liability governing the use of the entire Datto website.

### International Privacy Disclaimer

Because privacy laws are not the same in all countries, our non-U.S. operations may adopt additional measures depending on local legal requirements. Information obtained from our website generally is processed and stored in the United States in accordance with this Policy, which may not be as comprehensive as required in the European Union or other nations.

### Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements

Nothing in this Notice shall detract from the rights and obligations of the parties to any non-disclosure or similar agreement that Datto or any of the Datto family of companies have entered into with any customer or other third-party.

The Datto Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time, without notice and we encourage you to review this policy regularly for any changes. A current policy is available for review on our website at www.dattobackup.com.

If you have questions regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at 203.665.6423 or at our Norwalk, Connecticut address.
