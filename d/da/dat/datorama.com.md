# Privacy Policy - Datorama

Last Updated: November 8, 2016

Datorama, Inc. (“Datorama”) is committed to protecting the privacy of your information, and in this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy) we describe our web site privacy practices with regard to data collected by Datorama through the Datorama.com web site and other webpages that we operate in which we post a direct link to this Privacy Policy. Datorama sites are accessible worldwide, but Datorama is a U.S.-based company whose sites are hosted and operated in the United States. By voluntarily using a Datorama site and/or providing data or other information via a Datorama site, you are indicating your consent to this Privacy Policy and agree to be bound by its terms.

## personal information collection

When you visit a Datorama site, we may need certain personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) from you.

You may choose to provide us with Personal Information (such as your name, email address, phone number and company name) through a Datorama site when you elect to register with Datorama in order to receive a demo of Datorama platform.

## use of your personal information

When you provide Personal Information in order to register with Datorama, such Personal Information will be used in order to provide you with access to the requested content and/or information that we feel may interest you, or where you have consented to be contacted by us; to carry out obligations arising from any contracts entered into between you and us; to allow you to participate in interactive features of our service; and for other user support purposes. We may also use the Personal Information to help us understand who is using our products and services, to help us manage business development activities, and for research and analytical purposes. We will also use your Personal Information as we reasonably believe necessary to protect the safety, rights, property, or security of Datorama, Datorama sites or any third party, including to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to comply with applicable legal or regulatory obligations and as evidence in litigation; and to enforce our Terms of Use.

Datorama may also use Personal Information for marketing purposes. For example, Datorama may use information you provide to contact you about changes to our services or to further discuss your interest in our products or services and to send you information regarding Datorama and its partners, such as information about promotions or events. If you tell us that you do not want us to use this Personal Information as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.

## Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. If you no longer wish to receive our emails, newsletters or other communications you may unsubscribe at any time by using the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of such communication.

## Statistical and log information

In addition, we may automatically collect information from visits to a Datorama site to help us provide better customer service and to make a Datorama site as user friendly as possible. This information may include, without limitation, your IP address, the hostname of your device, browser information, domain name, and dates and times of site visits. We also measure visitor activity on a Datorama site, such as the webpages that users view. Datorama may use this data to analyze site traffic and trends and statistics.

## Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on all Datorama sites. We do not add the information we store in cookies to any Personal Information you submit while on a Datorama site. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate a Datorama site. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

Datorama uses persistent cookies to store a unique cryptographic hash value so you don’t have to enter your username more than once on a given computer. The information stored does not contain any Personal Information. See the Choice/Opting-out section for information on how to opt-out from Datorama tracking service.

## do not track disclosure

Datorama sites do not respond to Do Not Track signals. For more information about Do Not Track signals, please click here (<http://www.allaboutdnt.com/>).

## third party cookies

A Datorama site may use cookies that permit select third party partners to serve you Datorama-related content on their sites or elsewhere on the Internet. This is based on your prior visits to a Datorama Site. The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

## IP Addresses

When you visit a Datorama site, Datorama collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses to track and aggregate non-Personal Information. For example, Datorama uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which customers and visitors navigate a Datorama site.

## web beacons/usage analytics

Datorama employs, or our third-party advertising partners employ, web beacons and usage analytics software that help us better manage content on a Datorama site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by web beacons to our customers’ Personal Information.

## Links to Other Web Sites

A Datorama site may contain links to other web sites. Datorama is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. The links from a Datorama site do not imply that Datorama endorses or has reviewed the third-party web sites. We suggest contacting the operators of those web sites directly for information regarding their privacy policies.

## blogs/forums/chat rooms/bulletin boards

If you use a blog, forum, chat room or bulletin board on a Datorama site (“Forum(s)”), you should be aware that any Personal Information you submit in a forum can be read, collected, or used by other users of such forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the Personal Information you choose to submit in a forum.

## Our Disclosure of Your Personal Information and Other Information
