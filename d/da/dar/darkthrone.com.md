Lazarus Software collects personally identifying information during: (i) game signup; (ii) user surveys; 

In addition, we collect the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to our bulletin board, aggregate information about which pages visitors access, user-specific information about which pages visitors access and how much time is spent in particular areas, and information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or information provided in site registration forms, including but not limited to a visitor's name, address, and phone number.

Lazarus Software may use personally identifying information of its visitors to award prizes, track compliance with our Rules of Conduct, Anti-Spam policy, or for editorial purposes (to the extent that is explained when visitors provide the information). 

When you create a user profile or participate in interactive areas of Dark Throne, including the message center, forum, and chat room, all information volunteered by you is displayed or broadcast publicly to the Dark Throne community and/or to the chat room that you are visiting.
