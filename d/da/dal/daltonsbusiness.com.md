**DATA COLLECTION**

_What data do we collect?_

We will collect personal data as provided to us during the registration process, which you agree to supply to us accurately. We will also collect personal data from other parts of the DaltonsBusiness.com service, e.g. from competition entrants. We do not monitor your use of the Internet but we do use cookie technology to monitor your use of the DaltonsBusiness.com service. This information is not stored alongside your personal data. We may hold personal data relating to the transactions you enter into with DaltonsBusiness.com or others through DaltonsBusiness.com such as online retailers. We may also ask for other data so that we can obtain a better understanding of our users' requirements. This information will help us to sell appropriate advertising space and provide better personalised services for our users.

You may also supply us with other people's email addresses, for example, if you use our "email a friend" facility. We do not store or use email addresses gathered in this manner for any other reason.

_What do we do with it?_

We may use personal information about you to build up a profile of our visitors' interests and preferences and to build a demographic profile of our user base in order to target our own advertising more effectively. When you supply us with your details you consent to receive email newsletters or other information which may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to give your consent, you can un-tick the "Send me emails" checkbox on the 'My Profile' page of the "My Daltons" area. If this box is ticked, we consider you to have given us your permission to email you from time to time to promote our site and services. We may sell advertising onto these emails and may use our aggregate site profile to aid us in this activity; however, your individual details will not be passed on or disclosed to any third parties.

**Collection of information by third parties**

The information you offer us is passed on to our clients, at your request, in order for them to send you further details on a business or service you have enquired about.
