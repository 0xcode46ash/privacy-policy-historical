# Dogs Trust - Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Please read the below to see how Dogs Trust works to protect you.

#### Cookies and Web Privacy

We at Dogs Trust guarantee our commitment to respecting and protecting your online privacy.

This includes your need and your right to know what we do with the personal information you share with us. It also guides our company’s policies regarding the management of this data, including how the information is collected, processed, and for what purposes.

“Dogs Trust”: refers to the web pages. By accessing this website you are consenting to the way information is collected and used, as described within this Privacy Policy. In return, Dogs Trust gives the commitment that we will use the personal data you provide only in ways that are compatible with the following Privacy Policy.

 ** _The collection of information_**

Every time you log on to our website your IP (Internet Protocol) address registers on our servers. Your IP address reveals no information other than the number assigned to you. We do not use this technology to get any personal data against your knowledge or free will (i.e., automatically recording e-mail addresses of visitors). Nor do we use it for any purpose other than to help us monitor traffic on our website, or (in case of criminal activity or misuse of our information) to cooperate with law enforcement.

 ** _Cookies_**

We use a number of different cookies on our site. If you do not know what cookies are, or how to control or delete them, then we recommend you visit http://www.aboutcookies.org for detailed guidance.  
The list below describe the cookies we use on this site and what we use them for. Currently we operate an ‘implied consent’ policy which means that we assume you are happy with this usage. If you are not happy, then you should either not use this site, or you should delete the cookies having visited the site, or you should browse the site using your browser’s anonymous usage setting (called “Incognito” in Chrome, “InPrivate” for Internet Explorer, "Private Browsing" in Firefox and Safari etc.)

 ** _First Party Cookies_**

These are cookies that are set by this website directly.

Google Analytics: We use Google Analytics to collect information about visitor behaviour on our website. Google Analytics stores information about what pages you visit, how long you are on the site, how you got here and what you click on. This Analytics data is collected via a JavaScript tag in the pages of our site and is not tied to personally identifiable information. We therefore do not collect or store your personal information (e.g. your name or address) so this information cannot be used to identify who you are.

You can find out more about Google’s position on privacy as regards its analytics service at http://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/analytics/privacyoverview.html

 ** _Third Party Cookies_**

These are cookies set on your machine by external websites whose services are used on this site. Cookies of this type are the sharing buttons across the site allow visitors to share content onto social networks. Cookies are currently set by LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and Pinterest. In order to implement these buttons, and connect them to the relevant social networks and external sites, there are scripts from domains outside of our website. You should be aware that these sites are likely to be collecting information about what you are doing all around the internet, including on this website.  
You should check the respective policies of each of these sites to see how exactly they use your information and to find out how to opt out, or delete, such information.

 ** _Emails_**

Some emails that we send you have no tracking in at all e.g. service emails with invoices attached. Other emails we send we can track, at an individual level, whether the user has opened and clicked on the email. We do not use this information at a personal level, rather we use it to understand open and click rates on our emails to try and improve them. If you want to be sure that none of your email activity is tracked then you should opt out of our emails which you can do via the unsubscribe link at the bottom of every email we send.

#### Web Security

Financial transactions made online to Dogs Trust using this site are secure.  No one can access your credit card details via the internet.

### This is how our website works...

When you have completed your donation or sponsorship, your web browser will be connected directly to our secure server.  You can see that the connection is secure by looking at the padlock or key icon in the bottom left hand corner of your browser.  Your browser may also alert you to the fact that you are connecting to a secure server, and if so, it will also tell you when you are closing the secure connection once you have donated.  This is for your information only.  
Our secure server communicates with your browser using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocols, so that all your personal information, including credit card number and your name and address, is encrypted.  This process takes the words and figures you enter, and converts them into bits of code that are then securely transmitted over the internet.

### Data Protection

All forms and transactions on this site meet with data protection requirements.  If you are making a donation or enquiring about Dogs Trust we will ask you whether you are happy to receive future mailings and updates from Dogs Trust and whether you would be happy to receive mailings from other selected charities and organisations.  If you choose not to, your name will not be put forward in this way.

By providing us with your email address you are giving us permission to contact you via email, this may be either information regarding your transaction or any promotions from Dogs Trust we feel you may be interested in. You can unsubcribe at any time using the link on the email or by calling us on 020 7837 0006.
