## Privacy Policy

### Information Collection and Use

This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose (under certain conditions) your personal information, and explains the steps we have taken to secure your personal information. This also explains your options regarding the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. By visiting Dogasaur.com, you accept the practices described in this policy.

We may partner with other companies to offer you additional products or services. If you sign up for any of these additional products or services, we will share your name and other personal information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the products or services you have signed up for. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices on any web site to which Dogasaur.com links or that links to Dogasaur.com.

When you register to become a member of Dogasaur.com, we collect your name, email address and optionally your hometown, state and country. When you register your dog we collect the information you want to share about that canine such as name, age, likes, dislikes, sex, etc. Your name and email will never be shared, rented, bartered or sold with other users or third-party companies. All information entered about your dog(s) will only be used by Dogasaur.com to display on the site and will never be shared, rented, bartered, sold or exchanged. The website, however, is accessible by anyone with an internet connection and a web browser, which means that any words and photos you post can be copied by any other internet user. That is the nature of the internet and though we discourage anyone from abusing that option, it is something that must be noted.

Your name and email will never be shared with anyone in any way. If you chose to enter your hometown, state or country, that information will be displayed in any of your dog's web pages on the site, but the dog’s page does not share any other personal information or allow access to it.

The biographical information you enter about your dog(s) is instantly available to all other users of the site. Dogasaur.com does not claim rights for the pictures uploaded or the text information you add to the site. Please note, however, that Dogasaur.com is a public site and thus all photos and information you provide are available to anyone with internet access. Due to the nature of the internet you should never post a photo or fact that you do not now or ever want someone else to have access to.
