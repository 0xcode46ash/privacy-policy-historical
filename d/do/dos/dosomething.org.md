# DoSomething.org - Privacy Policy

We at Do Something care about your safety and privacy. That’s why we’ve set up this area of our site to tell you about our privacy policy. 

You can always access the latest version of this policy at www.dosomething.org. Of course, we won’t materially change the way we use information we already collected from you without your consent.

Okay, let’s get started. On this page, we’ll tell you: what personally identifiable information of yours is collected; from whom we collect information; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information that Do Something has about you; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

FROM WHOM WE COLLECT INFORMATION

We hope teens, their teachers and their parents visit our site often, and share their comments and questions. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to share personal information with us unless we have their parents permission, and ask that they not enter our online contests or sweepstakes. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from anyone under 13 without the appropriate permission, we will immediately remove that information. 

WHAT'S "PERSONAL INFORMATION" AND WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT IT? 

Personal Information is defined as anything that allows you to be located online or offline, like: 

\--First and Last Name  
\--Physical Address (street, city, state, etc.)  
\--Email Address  
\--Telephone Number  
\--Social Security Number  
\--A Persistent Identifier (like your e-mail address)  
\--Information Collected Online and Combined with identifying information

In other words, personal information tells people how to get in touch with you - online or offline - and, when combined with other information (like if you're a guy or a girl, your favorite color, your favorite sport, or stuff like that), it tells someone who you are. 

Why should you care? Because you shouldn't give out personal information to just anybody! That's why we've structured our site so that most of the time, you can interact with us, and with our Do Something community, without being identified. And, when we do have personal information about you, we use it only to fulfill your requests. 

WHAT KIND OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BY DO SOMETHING

OK. That makes sense. So what kinds of personal information does Do Something collect from visitors, why do you collect it, and what do you guys do with it? 

We collect some types of information automatically. Our web servers automatically collect limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit our site. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send your data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally, and we don't associate it with other personal information you may voluntarily share with us. 

When you register as a Do Something member, we ask for some personal information such as your e-mail address. We also may collect personal information if you voluntarily provide it to enter to win a grant or contest or submit content. For online grants and contests we may ask for name, email address, physical address, telephone number, age, school name and zip code, your gender, and your likes and dislikes, but only for the purpose of administering the prizes/awards. The information that we collect is for the sole purpose of administering the grants and contest/s and awarding prizes/awards. It is available only to Do Something and those who provide services to our site or help us administer contests and sweepstakes. Our contests are open only to those over age 13. To be eligible to win, however, the parents of anyone under 18 must sign an affidavit of eligibility before the prize is awarded. 

Our policy regarding this information is simple: except as provided in this statement, Do Something will not disclose, sell or rent any of the registration information you provide without giving you notice and an opportunity to refuse disclosure, except as required by law. We make an effort to include a link to the Privacy Policy wherever we ask you for personal information. 

One last thing to keep in mind – you also should not give out any personal information about yourself on any message board or posting.

WHAT’S THE DEAL WITH COOKIES, AND HOW DOES DO SOMETHING USE THEM?

In our effort to provide you services customized to your interests, we use cookies to keep and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. We use cookies to: access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; track the number of entries in our promotions and contests and identify which areas of our site you have visited. We analyze information obtained from cookies in the aggregate (for example, half of our users are female) and may share this aggregate information with advertisers and sponsors.

You should also be aware that companies that advertise on our site might use their own cookies. This privacy policy does not cover how these companies use their cookies. 

YOU OFFER SOME LINKS TO OTHER SITES. WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THEIR PRIVACY POLICIES? 

To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Although we do try to link only with sites who share our philosophy regarding information collection, and who indicate they do not intend to sell or share data with third parties, we don't control the privacy policies of other sites. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) or address in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. That policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, you should contact the site directly for more information. 

WHAT SECURITY MEASURES DO YOU TAKE REGARDING PERSONAL INFORMATION? 

Only authorized Do Something employees and consultants who work directly on the site and who agree to keep information secure can access personal information. Our servers are in a secure location. Since we only collect and retain limited personal information to begin with, and we don't sell or share it with third parties, we're confident that any information we do have is protected. 

ARE THERE ANY EXCEPTIONS TO YOUR PRIVACY POLICY, AND WILL YOU EVER CHANGE YOUR POLICY? 

We may use, retain or disclose personal information if required to do so by law, to cooperate in a legal investigation, or to protect the integrity of the site. Our privacy policy will be updated to reflect changes in legislation or fair information collection standards, but we won't make any retroactive change in how we handle personal data unless required to do so by law. 

WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I HAVE QUESTIONS OR WANT TO UPDATE, CHANGE, OR ACCESS INFORMATION? 

If you have questions regarding our privacy policy, or would like to update, access or change your information, please contact:
