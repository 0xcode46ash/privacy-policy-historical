# DoSomething.org - Privacy Statement for DoSomething.org

Do Something has a privacy policy. It was created by the Do Something Board of Directors in Summer 2003 to protect one of our greatest assets: your trust. Weâ€™ve created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to online privacy. The following discloses our online information gathering and dissemination practices. 

Our overall policy is extremely simple: If we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, and the other limited purposes outlined below. We will not sell or share your personally identifiable information with any third party. 

With respect to the Web pages that are co-branded with howstuffworks.com, their privacy statement governs all aspects of privacy on those pages. Do Something does not collect any personally identifiable information from those pages, and is not responsible for the data collection/usage policies or practices of HowStuffWorks.com. Do Something is also not responsible for any advertising that appears on the howstuffworks.com pages. 

Here are the details of our privacy policies. This statement may change over time -- please review it periodically. 

Types of Information Collected; Uses of Information  
We collect some non-personally identifiable information automatically and some in our registration forms and online surveys. Non-personally identifiable information might include your IP address, the type of browser or operating system you use, the domain name from which you linked to our site, your zip code, your age, your income level and other general demographic information. We use this non-personally identifiable information to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site; and we may share it with our state affiliates, or with out other business partners on an aggregated basis. 

Our site's registration form and online surveys may also request or require users to give us personally identifiable information (like their name, telephone number, home address and e-mail address). We may use the information from our registration forms and surveys to contact the user, but users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). We will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable data to any third party unless we first obtain permission from you. 

Cookies  
We may use "cookies" to determine whether you have visited our site previously and to save and remember any preferences that you set while using our site. Our cookies cannot retrieve any other data from a hard drive or obtain an e-mail address. Although a user has the ability to modify most browsers to either accept all cookies, notify the user when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize certain services at dosomething.org if cookies are rejected. 

Links  
This site contains links to other sites. Do Something is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

Security  
While there is no such thing as "perfect" security on the Internet, we will take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of your personally identifiable information. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. However, we do not assume any liability for third-party usage of your personal information, whether obtained legally or illegally from our system. 

Children  
Do Something seeks to collect information from children. It is our hope that children participate in Do Something with the blessings of parents and guardians, but also that these parents and guardians become involved with Do Something too! If any child provides us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian may notify us and such information will be deleted from our records.
