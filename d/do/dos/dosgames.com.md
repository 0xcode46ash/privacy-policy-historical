# dosgames.com privacy policy

  
Darren Hewer (�the webmaster�) operates several websites including DOS Games (www.dosgames.com). It is the webmaster�s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

**Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, the webmaster collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. The webmaster�s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how the webmaster�s visitors use its website. From time to time, the webmaster may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

The webmaster also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. The webmaster does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

**Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**

Certain visitors to the webmaster�s websites choose to interact with the webmaster in ways that require the webmaster to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that the webmaster gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who register for our discussion forum at <http://www.dosgames.com/forum/> to provide minimul personal details. In each case, the webmaster collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor�s interaction with the webmaster. The webmaster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this website. Google's use of the [Doubleclick DART cookie](http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/faq.aspx) enables it to serve ads to your users based on their visit to your sites and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html).

**Aggregated Statistics**

The webmaster may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites, currently facilitated through the services of [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/). (See [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/en-GB/tos.html) for their TOS & privacy policy.) For instance, the webmaster may monitor the most popular parts of the DOS Games site, and collect non-personally identifying statistics such as country of origin, screen resolution, and the length of time on the website, none of which is tied to any particular visito. The webmaster may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, the webmaster does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

The webmaster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on the webmaster�s behalf or to provide services available at the webmaster�s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the webmaster�s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. The webmaster will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, the webmaster discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when the webmaster believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of the webmaster, third parties or the public at large.

**Email Contact**

If you are a registered user of this website and have supplied your email address for the purpose of registering for the forum or for another reason, the webmaster may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what�s going on with the webmaster and our products, although historically such emails are sent very rarely. Previously a regular DOS Games Newsletter was sent out to all visitors who completed a double opt-in process to voluntarily receive it; this newsletter has been discontinued for several years.

We primarily use the front page of our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. The webmaster takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor�s computer, and that the visitor�s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. The webmaster uses cookies to help the webmaster identify and track visitors, their usage of the webmaster website, and their website access preferences. The webmaster visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the webmaster�s websites, with the drawback that certain features of the webmaster�s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

Although most changes are likely to be minor, the webmaster may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in the webmaster�s sole discretion. The webmaster encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
