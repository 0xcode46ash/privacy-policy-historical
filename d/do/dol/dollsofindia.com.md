[](http://www.dollsofindia.com/ardhanarishvara-symbolism.htm)

Ardhanarishvara is a composite androgynous form of Shiva and his consort Parvati. This form is shown as a fusion of half-male and half-female forms, split down in the center... The very name Ardhanarishvara implies "the Lord who is half-woman"... The deity symbolizes the optimal balance of the male and female energies in this world and also indicates that they are essentially inseparable forces, which are complimentary to each other and must work together to maintain equilibrium...
