Swaminarayan is considered as being equal to the Purushottama or the Supreme Being... Swaminarayan had exhibited his scholastic prowess from a very young age. He is believed to have mastered all the major Hindu scriptures...by the tender age of seven... Swaminarayan believed in a practical approach to religion and spirituality... After taking over the leadership of the Sampraday, Sri Swaminarayan involved himself in a lot of social work... Sri Swaminarayan was indeed an Avatar Purush of his time, one that richly deserves all the respect, devotion and adoration showered on him...
