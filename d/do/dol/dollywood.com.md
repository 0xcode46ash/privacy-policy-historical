The Dollywood Company is committed to protecting the privacy and security of our Internet visitors and customers. The following policy is designed to provide you the opportunity to learn more about how we use information collected via its website for:

This policy does not apply to information which we may gather in other ways from you.

By using any of this site, you are accepting the Dollywood Company Online Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right to modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy and security practices.

**Data Collection and Use:** No personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, or e-mail address, is automatically collected from your visit to this site. Non-identifiable information such as browser type, operating system, and IP address is gathered to ensure our site is optimized for the mass users. This information is also used to improve the performance of our site.

However, our various contact & reservation forms and surveys may request that you provide personal information (such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address) demographic information (such as your age and gender) and profile data (such as your preferences in entertainment and/or a record of past visits to the park). Information submitted at the time of registration or submission may be used for marketing purposes by us. In addition, should you elect to use the Trip Planner feature of the site, information about your trip will be stored by our vendor who provides hosting services for this website. 

You may elect to provide The Dollywood Company with anecdotes or stories of your visit to one of our attractions, or to provide images or videos of your visit. Our use of that material and your rights will be described in detail at the time you make your election to submit that material. 

When you make a ticket purchase through this site, you are actually making a transaction through one of our partner sites. That partner will collect such personal information (including credit card information) as may be necessary to complete that transaction. For information about the partner’s privacy policies, you may find a link on the transaction page that will take you to the partner site where their privacy policy will be found.

We also retain information regarding your purchase in our records, including information regarding your credit card. That information will be retained in the event adjustments or refunds may be required or to permit us to respond to questions which you may have. Only personnel with a “need to know” have access to that credit card information.

**An Important Note about Children’s Online Privacy Protection:** We do not knowingly collect any personal information about children under the age of 13 years. To sign up for our e-newsletters or other updates, podcasts, RSS feeds, etc, you must be 13 years of age or older. To participate in sweepstakes and contests, you must be 18 years of age or older.

**Security:** We collect contact information which you provide (such as your name, mailing and/or e-mail address), and when appropriate, credit card information (your credit card number and expiration date) to process your order. Contact information from an order form is used to fulfill orders, and to reply to questions submitted by users. Credit card information that is collected is used to process your orders and will not be shared with third parties. When you provide credit card information (or sensitive personal information on an online employment application), we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. We will give out personal information to third parties only to comply with any legal actions such as a court order or to protect the safety and security of site users, the site, and property. Within our companies, such information will be provided only to employees with a need to know.
