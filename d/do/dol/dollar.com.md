**_How is the information used and distributed?_** _

**1\. Non-Marketing Purposes:**

_

The information we collect is used by us to: 

Process the rental transaction;  
Improve our services to you;  
Develop programs for you;  
Enforce the rental agreement;  
Comply with law enforcement agencies. 

We use and distribute this information to employees of our subsidiaries, affiliates and franchisees to process, secure and confirm your car rental reservation, to monitor and improve your experience on our web site, and to develop programs based on your rental profile and preferences. We may also use this information from time to time to conduct telephone or e-mail surveys after the transaction to gauge your satisfaction with our service. To the extent necessary, we may share this information with third parties to process frequent flyer and frequent renter reward programs, to insurance companies to file claims, and to third parties for billing purposes or to enforce collection efforts against you, to detect fraud, prevent fraud and/or to comply with law enforcement agencies.

We may collect certain personal data that constitutes sensitive data in some countries, such as data about health conditions or members of a trade union.  Depending upon applicable local law, we may be unable to process such sensitive data without your consent. Data about your health conditions is regarded as sensitive in many countries.  If you ask us to accommodate a disability, such as by provision of hand controls, or if there is an accident and we need to work with insurance and claims management companies relating to any injury you may incur, we may need to process data about your health conditions.  Similarly, in the EU, at least, your membership of a trade union or similar organization is regarded as sensitive and we may need to process this information if you use a corporate account number that only members of that union or organization can use. 

Please note that if you wish to rent with us or our licensees and need to provide sensitive data, **you consent to that data being collected, used, retained and disclosed for our Operational Uses**.  We will not use sensitive data about you for marketing purposes.

In the event we are sold, merged or transferred to a non-affiliated third party, our customer list, including your individual personal information, may be included in the business assets transferred.

**Important points to note**

Please note the following points about the marketing choices you make:

  * If you change your marketing choices, we will observe your most recent choice with regard to the contact information associated with your membership number for the relevant membership program. Marketing choices you make with regard to one membership program will not modify your marketing choices for another membership program. Although we aim to process your choices promptly, you may still receive marketing communications prepared before we received your request to unsubscribe; 


  * If you change your email or physical address, we will continue to follow your directions for your most recent address provided from your ‘unsubscribe’ click noted above or your Dollar _EXPRESS_ profile. In order for us to continue to follow your directions at a new address, you will need to update your Profile online with your updated information and provide it to us with your changed contact information; 



If your Profile contains a customer/company discount program (CDP) number, your CDP, PC or affiliation sponsor may have made marketing choices for users of that CDP, PC or affiliation. If the sponsor’s choices are more restrictive on our use of your data than your choices, we will observe the choices made by the sponsor in connection with those transactions in which such CDP, PC or affiliation is used.
