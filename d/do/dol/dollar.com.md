# Privacy | About Us | Car Rental Lowest Rates | Dollar

**CONTACT US:**  We hope this policy answers your questions about our collection, use and disclosure of your personal data.  If it does not, or if you have any questions, please contact us by following the instructions in the Contact Us section below.

**Privacy Policy**

**YOUR PRIVACY**

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data we hold about you. This policy explains what data we collect about you, how we collect it, the measures we take in our efforts to keep your data secure and the uses and disclosures we make of it.  We also explain the options you have in relation to your personal data.

When you request services from us, operate a vehicle with in-vehicle  technology, access our websites, utilize our mobile “apps” or otherwise interact with us, for example, but without limitation, through our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) or the “apps” on those pages, you consent to our collection, retention and use of your personal data in the manner described in this policy and accept the risks outlined in the Security section.

**SCOPE**

_This policy covers the personal data we collect about you  in connection with our vehicle rental business which identifies you as an individual.  It does not apply to data that does not personally identify you as an individual, for example, but without limitation, aggregated anonymous data, IP addresses, computer operating systems, personal preferences, vehicle identification numbers, etc.  We are free to use data that does not identify you as an individual as we wish.  This policy does not apply to data collected by third party social networks (such as Facebook), mobile device manufacturers, third party “mobile apps”, wireless service providers, internet service providers or the operators of any networks through which you may interact with us and we expressly disclaim any responsibility for the data collection, privacy or data security practices of those entities.  With regard to pages on third party social networks, this policy only applies to personal data we collect through our pages (those with a direct link to this policy) and does not apply to any “unofficial” pages or pages of our affiliates or licensees.  Our websites are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly obtain personal data from such individuals._

**Who We Are** **  ** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We are Dollar Rent A Car, Inc., a subsidiary of The Hertz Corporation.  We provide and support vehicle rental services worldwide.  All references in this policy to “we”, “us” and “our” are only to us.  .  As such,  the business operations of our parent corporation, The Hertz Corporation, and other subsidiaries and businesses of The Hertz Corporation, including Thrifty Rent A Car, Firefly Rent A Car, Hertz Equipment Rental Corporation and Donlen Corporation are not covered by this policy because each of those entities/operations has its own privacy policy that is applicable to its operations. 

We operate a network of licensees in provision of our services worldwide and are affiliated to many other companies through ownership. As our [licensees](https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp#licensees "licensees") and [affiliates](https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp#affiliates "affiliates") are independent companies, they are not owned or controlled by us and are not covered by this policy, although they may have their own privacy policies to govern the personal data they collect. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our licensees and affiliates.

**_More about licensees and affiliates_** _…_

**_Licensees:_** _We have a network of independent companies licensed to operate vehicle rental businesses using the “Dollar” name and business system.   These companies are not our subsidiaries._

**_Affiliates:_** _These companies either control us (through ownership) or are controlled by the companies that control us. They cover a range of businesses but are generally not independently involved in provision of our services to you._ _ _   

**Legal Issues** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We do business in many countries and aim to comply with the privacy laws applicable to the personal data we collect and use. 

**Changes  ** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We may change this policy from time to time.  If we do so, the amended policy will take effect when we post it on the applicable website(s), mobile “apps” or our third party social network page(s).  Whenever we make a change, we will amend the “ **last updated** ” notice under the “Scope” heading in the “Overview” section above.  

If any change makes the policy less protective of your personal data, such change will not apply to data we collected about you before the change was made.  The only exception to this is, unless legally prohibited, where we have provided you with notice about the changes and given you the opportunity to tell us not to apply them to your personal data.

**COLLECTION  **

_We collect a range of data about you from a variety of sources for the purposes of our business. The examples we provide here are illustrative rather than a complete list of our practices._

**What We Collect** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

We collect the personal data and the non-personal data we need to process your reservation requests and to provide the services you request from us and for our operational uses in connection with such services, which may include:

  * Name, address and contact details, including telephone and mobile number, and email address; 
  * Date and place of birth, passport number and driver’s license number and, upon our request, a copy of your driver’s license; 
  * Your gender and photo; 
  * Employer(s) name, address and phone number; 
  * Credit card information; 
  * Frequent flyer and other membership reward or loyalty program information; 
  * Affiliations with or sponsorships by companies, associations, colleges or cities; 
  * Location data such as geographic location of electronic devices used to contact us or to access our mobile “apps” or of the vehicle you have rented; 
  * Information regarding the vehicle rented and its operation during your rental; 
  * Rental charges you incur and other information relating to your transactions; 
  * Information transmitted by your computer’s browser software; 
  * Itinerary information, including airline and/or flight information; and 
  * Information about your credit history or other publicly available information about you from consumer reporting agencies. 



We may collect certain personal data that constitutes [sensitive data](https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp#sensitive_data "sensitive data") in some countries, such as data about health conditions or membership of a trade union. Depending upon applicable local law, we may be unable to process such sensitive data without your consent.

**_More about  sensitive data…_**

_Data about your **health conditions** is regarded as sensitive in many countries. If you ask us to accommodate a disability, such as by provision of hand controls, or if there is an accident and we need to work with insurance and claims management companies (which may be a third party or an affiliate of ours) relating to any injury you may incur, we may need to process data about your health conditions.  Similarly, in the EU, at least, your **membership of a trade union** or similar organization is regarded as sensitive and we may need to process this information if you use a CDP or corporate account number that only members of that union or organization can use._

_Please note that **if you wish to rent with us or our licensees and need to provide sensitive data, you consent to that data being collected, used, retained  and disclosed for our Operational Uses.** We will not use sensitive data about you for marketing purposes._  
****

**Sources   ** **

**Websites** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

**Our Websites**

Certain technologies are used on our websites and on mobile devices to collect data about your visit or usage, as follows:

**Cookies**

A “ **cookie** ” is a set of data sent to your computer or mobile device by a web server that enables the server to recognize your computer or mobile device.

Cookies help improve the quality of your visits to websites, for example, but not limitation, by making the reservation process faster and smoother. The information the cookies provide helps in the development of content and features that may be of interest to you.

We use cookies to: 

  * Track your use of our websites during a single visit, remember the data you provide and the choices you make as you progress from page to page (“ **session cookies** ”); and 


  * Recognize you at your next visit (“ **persistent cookies** ”). 



Third party cookies may also be used on our websites for the purpose of:

  * Such third parties providing goods or services to you (for example, but without limitation, an insurance carrier paying or reimbursing you for a vehicle or equipment in connection with insurance replacement rentals); 


  * Performing services on our behalf; 


  * Facilitating business transactions with or through such third parties; or 


  * Providing advertisements to you. 



**_More about cookies…_**

_By adjusting your browser or installing certain software, you can restrict our use of cookies.   If you do this, you should be aware of the following:  _

_•  If you restrict our use of **session cookies** you will not be able to use our websites or certain features of our e-mail messages. You should be aware that session cookies are generally deleted or made unavailable to us as soon as you close your browser._

_•  If you restrict our use of **persistent cookies** you may still enjoy the full workings of our websites and e-mail messages but will need to re-enter some data when starting a new website session. Although persistent cookies will neither automatically be erased nor made unavailable to us upon closing your browser, they will typically “expire” after a number of years._

_If you are still unsure about cookies, please note that   our cookies are unable to retrieve other data from your computer’s hard drive or pass on computer viruses._ 

  **Pixel Tags**

In addition, “ **pixel tags** ”, “web beacons”, “JavaScript”, or similar technologies that enable, among other things, the tracking of your actions as a user of various websites or recipient of e-mail messages. (“Pixel Tags”) may be used. Pixel Tags may be used in connection with our web pages, our online advertising, or our e-mail messages, either by us or by our service providers, business partners or other third parties.

Pixel Tags are used to collect typically anonymous data to help identify types of information, including popular destinations, average rental prices, quote and conversion rates, click-throughs and other information to improve the service you receive or the relevance of advertising directed to you. Pixel Tags may also be used to identify which online advertisement or email has brought you to a website.

Further, certain Pixel Tags may be used by other companies for the purpose of tracking visits to their websites, identifying if such internet traffic came from one of our websites or confirming your eligibility to receive services or benefits from such other companies.

Third party cookies or Pixel Tags may collect information about a user of our site’s online activities over time and across different web sites.

Some of our web sites may use Google Analytics, which uses cookies and other, similar technologies (e.g. Pixel Tags) to collect information about website use anonymously and reports trends, without identifying individual visitors.  To learn more about Google Analytics, including how to opt out of it, visit https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements regarding goods and services that may be of interest to you when you access and use our websites and other websites, based on information relating to your access to and use of our websites and other websites.  To do so, these companies may place or recognize a unique cookie on, or other technology in connection with, your browser (including through the use of Pixel Tags).  If you would like to learn more about this practice, including your choices with respect to it, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp and http://www.aboutads.info/.

We do not respond to a web browser’s “do not track” signal, or other mechanism that indicates a request to disable online tracking of individuals who use or visit our websites.

As the internet and other eCommerce channels continue to develop, we may deploy and utilize different types of technologies to collect data regarding your visit or usage.

**Blogs or Message Boards**

Some of our websites and our official corporate pages on third party social networks (such as Facebook) may provide functionality that permits you to post public messages or responses to articles, comments or other postings.  You should be aware that by submitting such a posting, including any personal data or non-personal data in connection with it, you intend for that posting and any data in connection with it to be, and it shall immediately become, public and as such will not be subject to this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to remove any posting or content in a posting at our sole discretion.

**Other Company Websites**

Our websites and e-mail messages may contain links to websites operated by other companies.  You should be aware that the collection, retention and use of any data you provide on these websites will be governed by the privacy policy of the company providing the website and not by this policy.

**RETENTION**

_We try to ensure that the personal data we retain about you is stored securely and, in light of the information provided to us, is as accurate, current, complete and relevant as necessary for the purposes for which we use and disclose it._

**Storage** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------  
We generally retain personal data about our customers for as long as we believe appropriate for the purposes for which it was collected or as otherwise required or authorized by applicable law.

Our principal databases for storing the personal data we collect are located in Oklahoma, U.S.A.

**Security** **  
** \--------------------------------------------------------

As you may be aware, there is no completely secure method of transmitting or storing data. Although their physical characteristics are different, postal mail, telephone calls, text messages, faxes and transmissions over the Internet or wireless networks all present possibilities of loss, misrouting, interception and misuse of the data that is transmitted.

We take commercially reasonable measures to protect against the loss, misuse and unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction of your personal data by aiming to maintain appropriate physical, procedural and electronic safeguards to protect your personal data, including:

  * Restricting access to personal data to our employees and service providers on a “need to know” basis; 
  * Enforcing policies and procedures for our employees in their handling of personal data; and 
  * Using technologies designed to safeguard data during its transmission, such as [SSL encryption](https://www.hertz.com/rentacar/navigation/templates/privacyPolicyView.jsp#SSL_encryption "SSL encryption") for the data you provide on our websites. 



If you have reason to believe that any account with us is no longer secure, you must immediately contact us by following the instructions at the end of this policy. 

**_More about_** ** _ _** ** _SSL encryption…_**

_“SSL” stands for Secure Sockets Layer encryption. We use this protection when you submit personal data  to us on our websites.  SSL encryption seeks to ensure that you are actually sending your data to us and that no-one else can read or tamper with it during transmission._

_When you are asked to provide your personal data to us on our website, you will see that our “http” website address changes to read "https". The additional “s” denotes that the site is secure for that data transfer. You may also see a closed padlock symbol on your screen, again denoting a secure site._

**Security of Communications**

We try to strike a balance between the security of your data and your convenience.  As a result, we may sometimes use a method of communication that is less secure than a less convenient alternative.

For example, but not limitation, we will send you an e-mail or a text message in unencrypted form (i.e. instantly readable) because many of our customers are unable to access encrypted (i.e. coded) e-mail or messages. This means that our message, if misrouted or intercepted, could be read more easily than encrypted messages. For this reason, please do not include confidential information, such as your credit card number or account passwords, in any e-mail or text you send to us or on any posting you make to a public area of a third party social network page, especially since any such posting immediately becomes public.

For a more secure way to communicate with us over the Internet, please click on the “ **Contact Us** ” link on any page of www.dollar.com, and follow our instructions.

**Access and Correction**

\--------------------------------------------------------

You may access and review your personal data, change it and correct factual errors as follows:

  * If you are a member of Dollar Express, you may log into your member profile through under the “Express” tab on [www.dollar.com](http://www.dollar.com/). 



To protect your privacy and the security of your personal data, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access or making corrections to the data we store about you.

Certain types of personal data may need to be updated with the third party social network through which you may interact with us, rather than directly with us.

**USES and DISCLOSURES**

_Your personal data will not be used in a way that is incompatible with the purpose for which it was collected or as authorized by you. In that regard, by enrolling in one of our  membership programs, making a reservation with us, or renting a vehicle from us, you consent to our use and disclosure of your personal data for the operational uses listed below which may include disclosure of your data outside your country of residence.  We would also like to use and disclose your data for marketing purposes.   _
