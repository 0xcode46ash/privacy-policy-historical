## 7\. Cookies, Web Beacons and Targeted Advertising

Information About Cookies

Dollar General uses "Cookies" which are files stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. Cookies:

  * Help us identify our Customers and improve their shopping experience;
  * Do not include any Personally Identifiable Information. They do, however, allow you to use specialized features of the Website and hold selections in your shopping cart when you leave the Website without first checking out; and 
  * Can be disabled if desired. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive new cookies, or how to disable cookies altogether. If you choose to reject cookies, you may not be provided certain personalized services and will not be able to take full advantage of all of the features on our Website.



Information about Web Beacons

  * We may use third-party advertising companies to provide us: 
    * With data collection and reporting services regarding our Customers' activities on our Website;
    * Tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and
    * With delivery of relevant marketing messages.
  * Such companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity on Our Website.
  * Web beacons enable us to recognize a browser's cookie when a browser visits our Website and to learn which banner ads bring users to our Website.



Targeted Advertising

  * We and our third party service providers may use cookies to manage and track the performance of our advertisements displayed on other websites across the Internet.
  * Targeted advertising (also known as online behavioral advertising) uses information collected through an individual's web browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made. This information is then used to select which of our advertisements should be displayed to a particular individual on websites other than our Website.
  * The information collected is only linked to an anonymous cookie ID (alphanumeric number); it does not include any Personally Identifiable Information.
  * The information used for targeted advertising either comes from us or through third party website publishers.
  * If you would like to opt out of targeted advertising that occurs on our third party advertising publishers, please click here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. Please note that this will opt you out of targeted ads from us and any other participating advertisers. If you opt out, you will continue to receive online advertising from us; however, these ads may not be as relevant to you.



## 8\. What security does Dollar General use for information collected from me?

Security Methods Used for Personally Identifiable Information in Electronic Form

  * Dollar General and our third party service providers take numerous steps to secure your Personally Identifiable Information by using industry-standard techniques such as Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology.
  * Dollar General's servers are located in controlled, secured environments, protected from unauthorized access, and our systems contain technical security measures, such as firewalls, as well.



Although we exercise great care to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you should be aware that no technology is perfect and that there is always some risk involved in transferring data over the Internet, particularly if you send information to us through an unsecured means, such as e-mail. "Phishing" is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it is from us asking you for your Personally Identifiable Information, do not respond. We will never request your password, user name, credit card information or other Personally Identifiable Information through e-mail.

Security Methods Used for Personally Identifiable Information in Hard Copy Form

  * Hard copy documents containing Personally Identifiable Information are stored in a physically secure location and are retained in accordance with the requirements of local, state and federal law and Dollar General's internal policies.
  * At such time as documents containing Personally Identifiable Information may be disposed of, such disposal is accomplished in a manner that protects the confidentiality of the Personally Identifiable Information, such as shredding, and complies with the destruction requirements contained in Dollar General's internal policies.
