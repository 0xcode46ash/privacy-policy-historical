4\. Our Disclosure of Your Information.

As a matter of general policy, we do not sell but may rent some of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. We may send you offers from third parties in cases where we, at our sole discretion, believe the offer is both relevant and of substantive value to you. The following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services. 

  * _Advertisers._ We aggregate (gather up data across all user accounts) personal information and disclose such information to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. Certain information, such as your password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties. 
  * _Other Corporate Entities._ We share much of our data, including personal information about you, with our subsidiaries and joint ventures that are related services. To the extent that these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their other users. Our subsidiaries and joint ventures follow privacy practices no less protective of all users than our practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable law. DollarDays, its subsidiaries, its joint ventures, or any combination of such, will share some or all of your personal information with another business entity should we plan to, merge with, or be acquired by that business entity. Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice in as provided in Section 7 ("Notice"). 
  * _Legal Requests._ DollarDays cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, User Name history, fraud complaints history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep DollarDays free from bad elements we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity 



Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, or users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Site. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. 

5\. Control of Your Password.

You are responsible for all actions taken with your User Name and password. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your DollarDays password to any third parties. If you choose to share your User Name and password or your personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions taken with your account and therefore you should review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password as detailed in Section 6. 

6\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.

We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is very difficult to authenticate your account manually. You can change your user Id, email address, contact information, shipping information and user preferences by going to the my account link You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.   
Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, shipping information, from our databases. To make this request, email service@dollardays.com Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.   
We will retain in our files some personal information you have requested to remove to prevent fraud, collect any moneys owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law.
