# DoorOne - Shopping made simple

Last Updated: August 2006

Doorone.co.uk, uk.shopping.com, and dealtime.co.uk (the "Sites") are owned and operated by Shopping Epinions International Limited, an Irish incorporated company with its principal place of business at Unit 6 Blanchardstown Corporate Park, Dublin 15, Ireland (in the following "Shopping.com"), a member of the eBay Inc. group of companies.

Shopping.com believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide to our customers. To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, Shopping.com makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you about Shopping.com's collection, use and disclosure of information you choose to share with us through the Sites. 

This Privacy Policy is considered to be a part of Shopping.com's User Agreement. By using the Sites you agree to the terms and conditions of the User Agreement, including this Privacy Policy. By using the Sites, you are also consenting to Shopping.com's privacy practices, including the use and disclosure of any personally identifiable information that you have shared with us, as described in this Privacy Policy. 

### Minors' Privacy

The Sites are not targeted towards, or intended for use by anyone under the age of 18. By using the Sites you represent and warrant that you are 18 years of age or older. We reserve the right to terminate your membership in the event that Shopping.com becomes aware you are under 18. Persons under 18 may not submit any personally identifiable information to us, and if we discover that we have inadvertently gathered such information, we will take the appropriate steps to delete it. 

### What Information We Collect

**Information You Give Us.** The use of certain features and services on the Sites may require that you register and supply personally identifiable information such as your name, email address, telephone number and other information, which is stored by Shopping.com. We may also collect additional information from you in order to provide you with specific services and to personalize your experience on the Sites. For example, Epinions.com users may provide more information using features such as Wish Lists, and that information will be stored with your user profile. 

**Information Gathered Automatically.** The Sites use "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. Cookies used by the Sites may contain your user name, email address, IP address and/or postal code. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our Sites. "Clear gifs" are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and may be used to track the online movements of Web users or to let us know if you have opened an email that we sent you. Your access provider assigns an internet protocol address to your computer when you use the Internet. We collect each IP address that accesses the Sites; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; your behaviour on the Sites and related services, including the products and merchants you view or searched for, as well as the URL you come from and go to next; cookie number; participating merchants you visit and the items that you purchase. We use this data, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behaviour, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints, prepare aggregated reports that we share with others and customize your experience on the Sites. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches). Your browser must also be set to accept cookies in order to access the Sites as a registered member. 

**Other Data Collection.** We may get data from or about you in other ways not specifically described in this statement. For example, you might contact Community Care or customer support, or we may get a third party complaint about you. Any personal information that we collect will be handled in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Use of Information by Shopping.com

Information you provide to us through the Sites is used by Shopping.com to operate the Sites, provide you with information and services you request, and to communicate with you. We may, for example, use information you provide to target ads that we think you may be interested in, or send emails to you including newsletters and alerts. Your information may also be used to contact you when necessary (such as to assist you in your use of the Sites). You may always choose not to provide us with this information; however, this may limit our ability to provide you with a specific service. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the Choice/Opt-Out section below); however, you may not opt-out of some administrative emails (such as emails about User Agreement changes) while you are a member of the Sites. 

As our business evolves, Shopping.com may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including personal information, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of assets, or in the event of bankruptcy. In such an event, personal and anonymous information may be one of the assets transferred in order to continue to provide the Sites to you. You will receive notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) as provided in the "Notification of Changes" section below. We will require that the new entity holding your personal information follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

**Use of Information by eBay Group**  
In addition, we may share personal information with our parent company eBay Inc and its subsidiaries, joint venture partners, and other companies under a common control or acquirer.   
The eBay Group of companies currently includes PayPal, Skype, Kijiji, Half.com, Rent.com and others (see [www.ebay.com/aboutebay.html](http://www.ebay.com/aboutebay.html) for a current overview of the eBay Group). Any information about you which is shared within the eBay Group will be used to facilitate the efficient delivery of services to you. It may be used for internal statistics, strategic decision-making, customer reviews, identifying customer trends, customer verification, fraud prevention and security. You will be able to opt-out of receiving communications from other eBay companies at any time by following the unsubscribe opt-out instructions provided.

### Sharing and Disclosure of Information

**Aggregated Research Data.** Shopping.com produces research reports and other information and data about online shopping for participating merchants, and other customers, as well as media and other interested parties. Such information and data are based on aggregated, anonymous information about millions of online shoppers and do not include any personal information about individuals.

**Co-Branded Services.** Shopping.com usually saves information that it collects from users and shares this information with certain partners in order to provide services to users. In order to use certain services on the Sites, it may be necessary for you to enter information that then goes to our partner. The areas of the Sites in which partners are collecting information may be co-branded with our partners' logos. In these cases, the partner's use of personal information is governed by their privacy policies, not ours. Shopping.com may receive a copy of such personal information from these partners, subject to the privacy policies of such partners. If you have questions regarding the privacy policy or information collection practices of one of our business partners, please contact that partner directly. Shopping.com does not have control over and is not responsible for the information collection and use practices of our business partners. 

**Special Offers.** On the Sites, you may also have opportunities to express interest in or register for third party products and services. If you do, we will provide personal information about you to the third party to implement your request.

**Advertisers.** We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites. These companies may use information about your visits to the Sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. When we do this, we do not provide your name, address, email address or telephone number. 

Third party ad servers (including DoubleClick) may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data from your visits to the Sites and other websites to serve ads to you. For more about DoubleClick's practices and your options regarding their personal information collection and use, see [DoubleClick's Privacy Policy](http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy/). 

**Other.** We may share your personal information with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers, who assist us in maintaining the Sites and providing related services such as online registration for events.

**Transfer of Personal Information outside Ireland.** Shopping.com's headquarters are located in Ireland where we carefully adhere to the terms of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003. However, please note that your information will also be stored and processed in the United States. The laws on holding personal data in the United States may be less stringent than the laws applicable to the E.U. but Shopping.com will hold and transmit your information using security tools to protect its confidentiality. In order to use the Sites, you consent to the transfer of your personal information outside Ireland. 

**Legal Requests.** Shopping.com may lawfully disclose your personal information for law enforcement or regulatory purposes. Shopping.com cooperates with law enforcement inquires and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. We can (and you authorise us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other governmental officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate or in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, piracy or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

### Other Use and Disclosure of Information for the Sites

**Content and Ratings.** You can publish reviews, comments and other content. Members can choose to rate products or reviews, and to create a web of trust. As an unregistered visitor, we may allow you to rate products and/or reviews. 

Your review ratings and trust statements are displayed publicly unless you change the default configuration. Your member name is automatically displayed with reviews and comments you publish, and if other members choose to, they can receive email notifications of your publications or publish their own comments to your reviews. 

We, and our licensees, can republish your content as described in our User Agreement. We publish product ratings and use them to develop aggregate ratings, personalize site views and merchandise products. We use your review ratings and web of trust to personalize site views and identify/feature popular members. For example, we may promote most popular or highest-earning reviews and members. 

**Email Tools.** If you send emails through our Sites, your email will include your email address and any personal message you include. Although we do not retain, in any easily-retrievable way, the addresses that you are emailing, these emails are not private communications. Also, you may not use these tools to send spam or content that violates the User Agreement or applicable laws. 

**Feedback.** We may ask for your feedback through a survey, and we may use the results for our internal development and marketing research. We may also share the results with our affiliates, consultants, vendors and service providers. 

### Links to Other Sites

The Sites contains links to other web sites. Shopping.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy. 

### Changing or Deleting Information About You

Registered members may access, modify or remove their personal information or delete their membership account by accessing their Member Profile or Account information. We try to implement changes to our databases as quickly as possible. However, not all databases may be updated immediately, and some old data may remain in our archives and records for a short period until updated. Also, we may be unable to send changes you make to partners, vendors or third party service providers who have already received your data or content. If your account or membership is being terminated or suspended, we may maintain some data to prevent re-registration. 

We will retain in our files information you have requested to delete in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, analyze programs, enforce our User Agreement. Furthermore, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal constraints, including stored "back up" systems. 

### Choice/Opt-Out of Shopping.com Email Communications

At any time (and except for administrative emails discussed above), you have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from Shopping.com. To unsubscribe from the Shopping.com email newsletter, contact [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/aa24-contact_cs) and let us know that you would like to discontinue this service. In addition, each of our email messages contains a link at the bottom of the email for purposes of adjusting your email subscription preferences or to be removed from our mailing list. 

### Security

Shopping.com uses physical, electronic and administrative safeguards, including advanced firewall and password protection for our databases, designed to protect the security of data. We restrict access to your personal information to employees that need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services. 

### Notification of Changes

This Privacy Policy may be revised over time as our business grows and evolves. We will post any new privacy policy, along with the date of its last revision, prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Please check the Sites regularly for information about revisions to our privacy policy. If you would like to receive email notification of any such changes, please contact [Customer Support](https://web.archive.org/aa24-contact_cs) requesting the same.
