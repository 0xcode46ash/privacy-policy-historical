# Dooney & Bourke: Privacy Policy

  
**Dooney & Bourke - Privacy Policy**  
Revised November 2009  
  
Our Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect and use personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website.

**What do we collect?**  
Personally identifiable information is collected if you submit it voluntarily when placing an order or as part of any other communication you may choose to send. Information you submit may include things such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone number, date of birth, gender, credit card number, and the content of any messages or instructions you may send.

Our Website also records the IP addresses of visitors, as well as data on which pages a visitor views, the time spent at our Website, the Websites visited just before and just after our Website, and the advertisements and promotions users view and how they respond to them. This tracking information is used for general Internet tracking and marketing purposes. It is not generally associated with any personally identifiable information.

**How we use your information**  
We use the information you submit to process your order, provide customer service and make other products and services available to our customers and prospective customers. Occasionally, we may also use the information you submit to notify you about important changes to our Website, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable.

**What information do we share with third parties?**  
Except as outlined below, the personally identifiable information you submit via this Website will not be shared with third parties.

Agents: We employ other businesses, certain services and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include credit card processing, shipping, email distribution and promotions management. We provide these companies with only the information they need to perform their services and require them to limit its use to such purposes.

Marketing Partners: Occasionally, we make our postal or email mailing list (names and addresses only) and general shopping activity available to select companies whose products we believe will be of interest to you.

Business Transfers: In the event of a sale, merger or other similar transaction affecting our company, any personally identifiable information that has been collected and saved may be transferred to the new company.

Administrative or Legal Process: Your personal information may be transferred to third parties without notice to you or your specific consent in order to comply with a subpoena, warrant or court order, or if requested by a government institution with the legal authority to obtain that information. Dooney & Bourke may also disclose your personally identifiable information if it believes, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary or advisable to protect its rights or the rights of other users of this Website.

**Cookies and Web Beacons**  
Similar to many other Websites, our Website utilizes standard technologies called "cookies" and "web beacons." A cookie is a very small text document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a Website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. The cookie helps track the number of visitors and where visitors go on the Website, as well as the type of browser being used. Cookies can make using the Website easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. Many browsers contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Website, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Web beacons, also known as "clear gifs," are small pieces of code used to determine which advertisements and promotions users have seen and how users have responded to them. Cookies and web beacons do not allow us to gather any personal information about you and we do not store any personal information that you provide to us in your cookies.

**Security**  
We endeavor to use reasonable safeguards to help protect the security, integrity, completeness, accuracy and privacy of the personal information collected via this Website; however, because of the nature of Internet technology, it is impossible to eliminate all security and privacy risks. You acknowledge awareness of security and privacy risks, including but not limited to (i) the limitations of security, privacy and authentication measures, and (ii) the chance that data and information transferred via this Website may be subject to eavesdropping, breaking passwords, unauthorized access and other security or privacy hazards. We shall not be liable for damages of any kind associated with these risks.

**Privacy of children on our Website**  
Dooney & Bourke is concerned about the privacy of children and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.

**Links to Other Websites**  
We are not responsible for the practices employed by Websites linked to or from our Website nor the information or content contained therein. These other Websites may send their own cookies to you, independently collect data or solicit personal information and may or may not have their own published privacy policies. If you visit a Website that is linked to our Website, you should consult that Website's privacy policy before providing any personal information.
