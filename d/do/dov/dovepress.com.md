**Dove Medical Press Privacy Policy**  
Dove Medical Press has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. This document discloses our information gathering and usage practices.

**Use of your information**  
Dove Medical Press does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties unless required by law.

**Email**  
It is the policy of Dove Medical Press to send our members email throughout the publishing process and other email they elect to receive, in addition to customary business communications (payment confirmations, etc.). Further, it is our policy to immediately remove any member from any mailing list upon the member's request. In addition, Dove Medical Press will send newsletters and other communications to members. Newsletters will contain clear and obvious instructions for how the member can remove himself or herself from that mailing list. 

We do use email as a means of receiving feedback from our members, and we encourage you to [email us](https://web.archive.org/web/20090405183753id_/http%3A//contact.php) with your questions or comments.

**Membership Removal**  
If you wish to have your registration removed from our site for any reason, you may send us an email requesting this.

**Google Analytics - internet statistics**  
Dove Medical Press, like most large websites, uses the Google Analytics counting system to collect information such as the number of visitors per day or the number of pages requested per day. To do this, Dove Medical Press has a small piece of code on each page which counts these statistics. This enables us to see how we rank next to other Open-Access peer-reviewed journal websites. 

If you have any questions about our privacy policies or any other matter, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20090405183753id_/http%3A//contact.php)
