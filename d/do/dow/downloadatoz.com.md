downloadAtoZ.com is dedicated to providing and promoting software products, while at the same time maintaining your privacy. We do not distribute, share, or sell any customer information to any third parties, beyond what is strictly necessary to process credit card orders. All information that is provided to us by our customers is maintained for the sole purpose of providing technical and sales services.

**What information does downloadAtoZ.com gather?**

downloadAtoZ.com gathers general information about visits to our Web Site. This information includes the number of total visits to our web site, which browser is used to view our Web Site (including the version number), as well as which site referred the visitor to our site (no cookies are used in this process). This information is used to help us determine the general amount of traffic and downloads on our web site. It is also used to help us determine how many referrals come from certain sites (paid advertisements). No information is sent back to the referring site. Please note: This general information is in no way linked to any personal information concerning any individual visitor.

When a customer purchases any of downloadAtoZ's products, we store general customer contact information ("Customer Information") provided to us in our customer database (including name, address, telephone number, and email address). This helps us provide technical support and sales services to our customers. We do not distribute, share, or sell this information to any third parties, beyond what is strictly necessary to process credit card orders.

If a user chooses to purchase the software using a credit card, the credit card information is submitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption, along with the user's contact information, for the purpose of verifying the credit card and reducing fraud. The user's credit card information is not stored in downloadAtoZ's Customer Database.

We store Customer Information in order to ensure that we can provide quality technical support, sales services, software upgrades, and updated product information for our customers.

**How does downloadAtoZ.com protect consumer information?**

When you place orders or access your account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we take steps to protect the customer data we collect from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

**2.Cookies**

When ordering from one of our Reseller, a cookie is stored on the user's computer for the purpose of identifying the source of the sale (which Reseller referred the customer). No personally identifiable information is stored in this cookie. Also, no personally identifiable information is sent to the referring Web Site (Reseller).
