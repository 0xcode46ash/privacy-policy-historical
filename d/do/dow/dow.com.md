# Privacy Statement

The Dow Chemical Company (Dow) is committed to protecting your privacy on this Web site. Our privacy policy follows the Coalition for Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment (CASIE) Goals for Privacy for Marketing on Interactive Media. 

We collect personal information from our visitors only on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, title, company, address, phone number, email address, and other relevant data. We do not require this personal information to obtain access to most of our site. We do, however, require it to download product information. In both cases, this allows us to contact you with additional product information should the need arise. 

The personal information we collect is used only to process a request for information or for marketing our products or services. We do not sell, rent or transmit personal information to other organizations. 

If you would like to correct your information, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/webapps/reg/OverviewRegistration.asp?caller=/homepage/privacy.html) or write us at:

Please give us your full name and phone number in case we have questions. 

Our web server also collects the domain names (dow.com, for example), but not the e-mail addresses of visitors to our website. This information is aggregated to measure number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, and other relevant statistics. We collect this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. 

Dow's website may contain "links" to other sites, and we attempt to only link to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites and you are responsible for your visits to those sites. 

Dow takes reasonable precautions to keep all information obtained from our online visitors secure against unauthorized access and use and we periodically review our security measures.
