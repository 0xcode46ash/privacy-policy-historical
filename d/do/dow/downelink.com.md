About DowneLink and the Information We Collect   
DowneLink is an online gay community that allows users to interact with one another through social networks and resources. The foundation of DowneLink is to provide a space for Downe people and their friends to exchange ideas, build friendships, and utilize local and nationwide services. As with any community, we hope to grow and introduce new and innovative services that will suit their wants and needs.

Information submitted to DowneLink  
DowneLink collects user-submitted account information such as name and email address to identify users and send notifications related to the use of the service. DowneLink also collects user-submitted profile information such as gender, age, occupation, location, etc. 

Use of Information Obtained by DowneLink    
Profile information as well as first name and photos are displayed to people in the DowneLink Community, to support the function of the site as social networking community where users can meet new people through their friends. Email address and full name are used when a user invites a friend via email to join the service, and when we send notifications to a user related to their use of the service. Except when inviting or adding friends, a user's email address is not shared or displayed with people within the community. Users within a personal network communicate on DowneLink with each other through the DowneLink service, without disclosing email addresses. 

Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks  
As a matter of policy, except where you are expressly informed otherwise, we do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law or for the protection of your membership. However, DowneLink may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties in order to present to members more targeted advertising, products and services. In such situations we will never disclose information that will be used to personally identify you.
