No personal information given to us is used for any purpose other than what is stated - to send an email from us related to our game club newsletters or to help you with your ordering information.

**Site Visitors**

For each visitor to our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only the consumer's domain name and IP address, but not the e-mail address (where possible). Email addresses are collected if visitors double opt-in to our Game Club services. Email addresses are then only used by Download Free Games and not sold, rented, given, or shown to any other company for any use whatsoever. Our use of double opt-in email addresses is to notify visitors of new games added to the site, send tips, or any information related to Download Free Games' products. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are used on many download links to track referrals from this site. All full version purchases made from these downloads are then credited to Download Free Games from software developer partners on a revenue sharing basis. At this time, Download Free Games does not set any cookies itself.

 **Ad Servers**

With respect to Ad Servers: We are currently partnering with Google to deliver ads. We cannot be responsible for the quality of ads or the operation of sites that buy ads through Google.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact The DMA's Committee on Ethical Business Practices at mgoldberger@the-dma.org.
