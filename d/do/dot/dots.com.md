We at Dots.com are concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly collect, use, and/or disclose personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior parental consent. 

Dots.com collects the personal information from children at our e-mail registration and sweepstakes consent form: name, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, date of birth, and fashion and event preferences. We may use this information from children in order to conduct our sweepstakes and for marketing purposes. We may also share this information with outside vendors and other organizations that provide support services to us in relation to customer orders or that help us with our marketing programs. Except as just discussed, Dots.com does not sell or trade the personal information of children under 13 to others.

Children under the age of 13 who desire to register for our e-mail updates and sweepstakes are required to have their parent or legal guardian complete and mail in [the consent form](https://web.archive.org/web/20010406214653id_/http%3A//www.dots.com/dotsmail/pdfsignup.htm). **We discard any e-mail registration that is not accompanied by a parental consent form.**

Dots.com does not collect or store information in messages that children or others send by e-Dot cards. 

Dots.com does not condition a child's participation in any online activity or the collection of more personally identifiable information than necessary for that activity. 

Upon request, a child's parent or legal guardian can review and have deleted the information that we have collected and ask that we stop collecting it in the future. A parent or legal guardian of a child under the age of 13 has the right to find out what personally identifiable information that we have about the child. A parent or legal guardian may contact us at **1-877-874-2674** during regular business hours. 

If we change our Privacy Policy with respect to children, we will seek to obtain parental consent before using any previously collected personal information in the new manner.
