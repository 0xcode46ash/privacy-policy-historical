Does dotPhoto disclose or share my personal information with anyone else?

dotPhoto will use your personal information to provide you with all of its services, including processing orders and other transactions. We do not disclose your personal information or information about your visits to dotPhoto to any outside companies. However, we may aggregate general statistical information regarding our customers as a whole and the overall usage of our site, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned into a certain program. We will only use this information in the aggregate. We may share this information with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. We use this data to customize and improve our service. We may provide this information to parties who have a vested interest in dotPhoto and with whom we may have a contractual obligation in certain circumstances. We may also provide your e-mail address to pre-screened third parties, but you may unsubscribe from those lists at any time by choosing unsubscribe links under "Privacy" in the MyAccount options.

How do I share my Photographs?

The privacy and security of your images and sounds is very important to us. Only you can decide to share this information. If you do decide to share this information, you will have to provide to your guests a password which will let them experience only the images and sounds which you have chosen for that guest.

Does dotPhoto use "cookies"?

dotPhoto will not save information such as your password or your credit card number on cookies. We may use cookies to manage your dotPhoto session, and if you choose, to store your sign-in and password information (so you don't need to re-type it in every time you log in).

Are there any exceptions to this dotPhoto's policy?

If dotPhoto believes, in good-faith, that the law requires it or, or if it is necessary to protect dotPhoto's rights or property, it may disclose customer information to proper law enforcement authorities. This disclosure may be necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against anyone who may attempt to cause injury to another's rights or property.

### Security Policy

All personal information provided to dotPhoto by its members is handled through a secure server. dotPhoto uses industry standard secure server software (SSL) for all photo ordering and account management transactions. This software uses encryption technology to ensure that all of your personal information, including credit card number, name, and address, cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. You can tell if you are using a secure server by looking at the bottom of your browser window. In Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see a lock icon. When the symbol is broken or the padlock appears to be in its closed state, the page is encrypted and therefore secure. If you wish to take advantage of the latest encryption standards, be sure you have the latest version of the browser you are using. You can download the latest version from the Netscape or Microsoft Web sites. 

**Personal Passwords**

Your dotPhoto account and all of your information is protected by a password. You choose a password when you become a dotPhoto member. The password must be between 4 and 10 characters long, and should include both numbers and letters. Make sure to select a password that isn't obvious, such as your name or your birthdate. A good password will contain seemingly random letters and numbers, for example, D4M6B2. Do not share your password. You can change your password at any time, and you can set a new password in case you forgot your old one. 

**Guest Passwords**

When you want to share images or sounds, you will assign a guest password to only to those images or sounds which you desire to share. That guest password will enable those who receive it to log onto your account at the site and view the images and sounds assigned to that password.
