# Privacy Policy - Dotti Nation

Your privacy is as precious to us a finding a pair of sky-scraping Louboutins in the bargain bin at the local op-shop. The following info may be a little heavy reading but it is still as important to us as you are.

#### PRIVACY IS IMPORTANT

We recognise that privacy of personal information is important to individuals. Personal information for our business purposes is to be minimal, private, correct, safe and largely in the control of the individual. Except where otherwise legally appropriate we will treat your personal information as private.

#### YOUR SAY ON YOUR PRIVACY

If you have a particular concern or query about your personal information held by us you should contact out Privacy Officer (P.O Box 2196 Richmond South Vic 3121, privacyofficer@jjh.com.au - Ph. 1800 333232) whom we have appointed for your assistance.

#### THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS

We are principally a retailer. Retailing can utilise a number of facilities and functions including shops (off the street and in shopping centres), the Internet, promotional material (using various forms including paper and electronic mail outs), credit and other card systems, layby arrangements and reward schemes. As a successful and long established retailer we carry out any or all of these means of business from time to time. We have built an enviable reputation as one of Australia's largest specialty retailing groups upon servicing our customers.

#### OBTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION

Because of the nature of our business it is necessary to obtain personal information from time to time. We will however not be unduly, intrusive nor obtain or use information in an inappropriate manner. We will only ask for and use personal information we reasonably need to conduct our business. If you have received any promotional material and do not wish to receive it then upon letting us know we will not send it to you.
