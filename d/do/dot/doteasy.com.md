DOTEASY PRIVACY POLICY

Doteasy.com is owned and operated by Doteasy Technology Inc.  Doteasy is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.  This statement is therefore set out to outline how we make use of the information you submit to us during registration.  The terms contained on this page may be revised from time to time.  To protect your interests, visit this page periodically to review the current terms of our policy. 

Personal information is requested when you register to be a member.  During registration, you are asked to provide your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal or zip code, occupation, industry and personal interests, etc.  The more information you submit and the more accurate it is, the better we are able to tailor our services to your needs. 

Doteasy's purpose in collecting personal information is to identify the member as well as to send recent updates and important announcements via post and/or email.  Doteasy does research on our members' demographics and interests based on the information you submitted to us upon registration.  We do this to better understand and serve all our members.  This data is compiled, analyzed, and used only by Doteasy.  No part of the information you have provided would be sold, disclosed, or made accessible by third-parties or by the public. 

In our role of delivering targeted advertisements (via email newsletters), Doteasy is the middleman.  Advertisers give us an advertisement and tell us the type of audience they want to reach.  Doteasy chooses appropriate advertisements to include in the email to be sent to the target audience.  In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information or any personal member information. 

Members hold complete freedom to express themselves on their web sites.  Although your intellectual freedom is respected, Doteasy still reserves the right to remove from our servers any obscene, threatening, or illegal content.
