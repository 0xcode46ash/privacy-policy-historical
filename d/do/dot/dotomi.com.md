# Dotomi: Perspectives on Privacy

Welcome!  At Dotomi, we take privacy seriously because we are proud to be a leader in the field of internet advertising and a true innovator in the way people, including ourselves, buy the things we need.  Our privacy policy is aimed to clarify what information we collect, how we safeguard it, and when we use it to provide relevant advertising about products of interest. 

The effective date of this privacy policy is June 8, 2009.

Dotomi was founded with the basic principle of empowering consumers with control to drive relevant advertising.  This foundation includes the belief that each consumer’s private information should be protected.  Our success, in part, comes from our ability to achieve two basic consumer needs in a holistic fashion: 

  * Preserve every consumer’s right to receive personalized advertising; and
  * Respect every consumer’s privacy by not utilizing personally-identifiable information to determine what products and services are of interest to them.



Dotomi’s team is comprised of industry leaders that have been involved in internet advertising and consumer privacy from the very beginning of the online space.  This experience has helped us forge a business around one central belief: _it is possible to provide each individual consumer with the privacy they deserve, while giving them access to valuable information about products and services that interest them._  

**_Scope of Privacy Policy_**

This Privacy Policy applies to Dotomi’s online method of collection and use of anonymous information gathered by us for this website and clients that we serve.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the privacy practices of our clients.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

___How does Dotomi provide consumers relevant advertising?_

We partner with Marketing companies (“Marketing Partners”) whose Privacy Policy allows them to share anonymous information about their customers and/or inquirers as well as information about a consumer’s interests and/or purchase behavior.  All Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) is rendered anonymous for our services.  We will not and do not accept any credit card numbers or Social Security numbers from any Marketing Partner.

The combined Marketing Partner information provided allows us to analyze and understand more about the things consumers are or might be interested in, allowing Dotomi to replace advertisements with ones more relevant to the consumer.

___How does Dotomi find consumers on the web?_

When a consumer visits our website or one of our Marketing Partner’s websites a “cookie” or “pixel tag” may placed on the consumer’s machine. Information collected from cookies or pixel tags are not linked to PII.  No PII is transferred in the Dotomi cookie or pixel tag.  Dotomi only knows that consumer by an anonymous ID, so that we can replace non-relevant ads with ads that are more relevant to the consumer’s interests.  Again, we don’t know who the consumer is, we just know the consumer’s preferences through that ID.

___What is a “Cookie” or “Pixel Tag”?_

A cookie is an industry-standard small data file placed on a consumer’s computer.  Cookies allow marketers to “remember you” when you return to their website.  Again, no PII is transferred in the Dotomi cookie.  Consumers have the capability of deleting cookies on their machine; however, if they enjoy the convenience of a website remembering them, consumers are advised not to delete their cookies.  This website contains, in addition to Dotomi cookies, other third party cookies that assist us in supplying information that will make it easier for you to navigate on our site.

A pixel tag (also commonly known as a web beacon) is an industry-standard, often-transparent graphic image usually no larger than a 1x1 pixel that is placed in a website or e-mail.  Again, no PII is transferred in this pixel tag.  This allows a marketer to understand what products or services a consumer - as a “user” - may be interested in based on their actions on a Marketing Partner’s website or within an e-mail.  Dotomi cookies and pixel tags do not track the consumer outside this site or of the Marketing Partners websites or e-mail unless it is to display an advertisement.

___Disclosure of Information_

We may disclose the anonymous information to our Marketing Partners and other third parties for advertising, marketing and analytical purposes.  Dotomi may also need to disclose anonymous information if (1) we believe that there has been a violation of the law, of your rights, or of our rights, (2) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law, and (3) if our company or substantially all of its assets are acquired.

_____Why Dotomi Inc.?_  
As you surf the internet, you will receive ads.  Wouldn’t you rather receive ads that are more relevant to you?  Remember, you will receive no increase in the number of ads you receive in a given day.  The Dotomi difference is that you will receive more relevant ads.
