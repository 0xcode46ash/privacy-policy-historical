# DomainSponsor.com :: Privacy Policy

**Last Updated 10/01/07**

At DomainSponsor™, we recognize that privacy is an important issue, so we design and operate our services with the protection of your privacy in mind. This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") outlines the types of personal information we gather when you use our web pages, as well as some of the steps we take to safeguard it. By visiting our web pages, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

## Data Collection

DomainSponsor™ does not require any personally identifying information except as provided herein. We collect limited non-personally identifying information your browser makes available whenever you visit a web page. This log information includes your Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your query and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser. We use this information to operate, develop and improve our services. In addition, when you open and maintain an account with DomainSponsor™, we collect certain personal financial information such as your billing address, bank name and address and bank account number.

## Log Files

We gather certain information automatically and store it in log files, which contain information such as IP addresses, browser type, operating system, ISP, date/time stamps and referring pages. This information is used to track statistics and trends on an aggregate basis, and does not identify individual users. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

## Cookies

Upon your first visit to our web pages, a cookie is sent to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. A "cookie" is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a web page. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service and to better understand how people interact with us. We do this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people search. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent.

## Tracking Pixels

We use tracking pixels on our web pages in order to gather and aggregate, non-personally identifiable and anonymous information. A tracking pixel is an electronic tag that is placed on a web page. Tracking pixels can be used to count the number of visitors to our web pages and gather information and develop profiles about such visitors and/or click on links on our web pages. Such devices are also known as 'invisible' or '1-by-1' GIFs due to their incredibly small size which usually cannot be detected.

## Other Uses of Information

We use your information and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on our web pages to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, collect fees owed, pay amounts due you, verify your account data, measure user interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates, customize your experience, detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity, and enforce our Terms of Service.

You agree that we may use your information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your perceived interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of our sites. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information.

## Updating Your Information

We provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personally identifying information for many of our services. For more information, please see the help pages for each service.

## Links

Any websites that may be linked to from our web pages are developed by people over whom we exercise no control. These other sites may place their own cookies on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our web pages and to read the privacy policy of each web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by our web pages.

We may present links in a format that enables us to understand whether they have been followed. We use this information to understand and improve the quality of DomainSponsor's™ search technology. For instance, this data helps us determine how often users are satisfied with the first result of a query and how often they proceed to later results.

## Privacy Policy Changes

This Privacy Policy may change, from time to time, due to changes on our web pages, legal developments, business factors and ever-changing technology. Notifications to changes of our Privacy Policy will be posted on the DomainSponsor™ website, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it periodically. Your continued use of our web pages following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.

## Disclosures of Personal Information

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on us, our parent or affiliated entities. Additionally, we can, and you authorize us to disclose your personal information when we believe, in our sole discretion, that disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect our rights or in connection with an investigation into alleged fraud, intellectual property infringement or other purported unlawful activity.

Individual customers who reside in California and have provided their personal information to us may request information about our disclosures of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Such requests must be submitted to us at [privacy@domainsponsor.com](mailto:privacy@domainsponsor.com).
