# Privacy Policy - Magnetic Search Retargeting

## Updated March 14, 2014, Effective May 9, 2014

Magnetic Media Online (“Magnetic” or “we”) is committed to consumer privacy protection.  This policy applies to Magnetic and provides information about our services, the information we collect, how we use and share the information, your rights and how to contact us.  This privacy policy covers our collection and use of information relating to a natural person (“information”), including usage information we collect by automatic means in relation to our services and information you may provide to us directly.  This privacy policy does not cover the collection and use of information by any third parties and Magnetic is not responsible for third party privacy practices.

**MAGNETIC SERVICES**

Magnetic partners with publishers across the web to deliver personalized advertising, which is sometimes referred to as “targeted advertising” or “retargeting.”  Our goal is to deliver highly relevant advertisements based on specific online activity related to search and site behavior.

**COLLECTION AND USE**

We personalize ads by remembering what you search for online and we use that information to select the ads that might be relevant to you. In simple terms, you visit a publisher web site.  Magnetic then collects the browser and/or search keyword data that you have entered.  On a following visit to another site you will see personalized ads based on your previous activity.  In doing so, we may also collect information about pages that you view, links you click, online identifiers such as your IP address either directly or from third parties (“usage information”), and other demographic and geographic information such as your language preferences and the country you visited the site from.

Magnetic mainly collects and processes usage information for the purpose of retargeting and does not use this information to identify you.  In the context of retargeting, Magnetic does not intentionally collect or receive from third parties information that directly identifies an individual such as name, email, telephone, address, or social security number.

We also may supplement our database with information we receive from third parties that does not directly identify an individual.  Magnetic does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

We use our database to predict your interests so as to provide you with the most relevant advertisements.  We may use general search terms such as diet, fitness, or smoking to help determine which ads a user might be interested in.  However, we do not purposely collect or process sensitive data or health data as defined under EU data protection law.

Magnetic is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative and strives to comply with NAI’s Self Regulatory Principals. Magnetic also participates in the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA)’s [AdChoices](http://www.aboutads.info/) icon initiative, which provides consumers with information pertaining to data usage associated with online advertising.

When you contact us via our online contact form available on our site, we may collect your name, title, email address, company name, city and state to process your inquiry, but do not use this information to serve you targeted advertising.  You may also choose to provide us with this information when you participate in our marketing campaigns and events.  We may use this information to follow-up with you and inform you about events, news and other activities that we organize. We do not link this information, or any other information used or intended to be used to identify a particular individual, with data we collect that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but not to an individual.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION**

  * We may share the information we collect with service providers, publishers and advertisers, our customers, and other third parties so that our partners can improve their offerings and services. We require such third parties by contract not to attempt to merge the information we provide with information they have that directly identifies specific individuals without obtaining those individuals’ opt-in consent. In addition, we require our service providers by contract to keep the information confidential and secure.
  * We may work with other advertising network providers to help us provide you with relevant ads.
  * We may share information about you: if, as determined in our sole discretion, necessary to comply with laws or regulations; in response to a subpoena, order, or government request; to protect our rights or the rights of others; or when a part or all of our company is being sold.



**MAGNETIC TECHNOLOGY & COOKIES**

We use technologies such as unique identifiers, pixels and cookies (visit <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie> for complete definition) that are set on your device when you visit a website where Magnetic has a relationship with the publisher.  We may use session cookies that expire when you close your browser and cookies that may remain on your device to help us collect information about your online activity on publisher’s site and other sites that you visit.  We may also use cookies to see if you have opted out from our services as described below. ****

If the website you visit is targeted at individuals in the European Economic Area, you may be served with a banner on some publishers’ websites that link to our website.  We contractually require publishers to provide notice and obtain appropriate consent, where required by applicable law, for the use of Magnetic technology and cookies described in this section.  We however have no control over and we do not bear any responsibility for the privacy policies, consent and/or content of any sites or advertisers linked to our website, or the cookies these sites might set in your browser.  We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn about their data collection practices.

**DATA RETENTION**

Search data is retained and used by Magnetic for ad targeting for up to 90 days. Following the 90-day period, Magnetic archives the data for internal use and research in aggregated form. Visit <http://domdex.com/i> to see information being used for ad personalization.

**CONSUMER CONTROL & RIGHTS**

Consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant advertisements.  You may opt out free of charge from the processing of information we collect for retargeting.  However, by opting out that does not mean you will block online advertising all together or see fewer ads.  It simply means that the ads that you see may be far less relevant than prior to opting out. ** ** Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.

Your choice to opt-out from personalized ads placed by Magnetic will not affect ads placed by any other organization outside of Magnetic.  In addition, we comply with opt-out requests by placing an “opt-out cookie” on your computer or device.  Consequently, if you clear your cookies on that computer or device, we will not technically be able to read our “opt-out cookie” and will thus resume collecting information from that computer or device for purposes of retargeting. Similarly, an opt out request will not be effective on other computers or devices you may use if you have not opted out while using that device

If you are located in the European Economic Area, you may have the right to request access to, rectification or deletion of the information we maintain about you, within the limits of applicable law.  You may also have the right to object to the processing of the information we collect about you.  You may exercise those rights by contacting us as described at the bottom of this privacy policy.

If you have provided us with information to participate in our marketing campaigns and events, you have the right to opt-out from receiving further communications at any time.  In addition, some categories of information may be marked as mandatory in our contact forms and other similar forms.  We may not be able to process your inquiry if you decide not to provide the information marked as mandatory.

Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to a DNT signal, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.

**OPT OUT OPTIONS**

***To opt-out of receiving personalized ads from Magnetic:** Visit <http://domdex.com/optout.php>. Once you opt out, Magnetic will no longer deliver targeted ads to your browser.  If you delete your cookies, and wish to remain opted-out of ad targeting, you will need to re-visit the opt-out link above. Please note that the opt out cookie is specific to the browser you are using, and if you clear cookies, change browsers, or change devices, you will need to opt out again.

**  *You can opt out of receiving personalized ads from Magnetic and other advertising companies:** Visit the consumer choice page “AboutAds” at [http://www.aboutads.info/.](http://www.aboutads.info/)

**HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION**

We employ reasonable security measures to guard the information processed in our systems against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, alteration, disclosure, access or other use and we comply with applicable security requirements. However, despite the measures we take we cannot warrant the security of any information provided to or collected by us.

**DATA TRANSFERS**

Our services are hosted by servers located in the United States. We may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected for purposes such as storing and processing the information, responding to your inquiries, and operating our services.  Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country from which the information was initially collected.

If you are located in the European Economic Area or other regions of the world with laws governing international data transfers, we comply with applicable legal requirements on adequate protection for data transfers.  When we transfer information to other countries, we will protect it as described in this privacy policy.

By using our services or website, you understand that the information we collect about you may be transferred to the U.S. and you consent to such transfer, storage, and processing.  ** **
