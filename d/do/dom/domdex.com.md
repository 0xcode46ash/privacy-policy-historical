# Privacy Policy | Magnetic Search Retargeting

## Updated March 11, 2015

Magnetic Media Online (“Magnetic” or “we”) is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals. This policy applies to Magnetic and provides information about our services, the information we collect, how we use and share the information, your rights and how to contact us. This privacy policy covers our collection and use of information relating to a natural person, including usage information we collect by automatic means in relation to our activities and information you may provide to us directly.

 **1\. MAGNETIC ACTIVITIES**

Magnetic partners with publishers across the web to deliver personalized advertising, which is sometimes referred to as “targeted advertising” or “retargeting.”  Our goal is to deliver highly relevant advertisements based on specific online activity related to search and site behavior. In simple terms, you visit a web site of one of our partners. We collect the browser and/or search keyword data that you have entered. We use that information to select the advertisements that might be relevant to you so that on a following visit to another site you will see personalized ads based on your previous activity. In doing so, we may collect information about pages that you view, links you click, online identifiers such as your IP address either directly or from third parties and other demographic and geographic information such as your language preferences and the country you visited the site from (“usage information”). We then process this usage information to offer our customers the service of Online Behavioral Advertising.

In some cases Magnetic will collect, process and use your IP address, while you visit our website(s). We may also supplement our database with information we receive from third parties that does not directly identify an individual. In the context of retargeting, Magnetic does not intentionally collect or receive from third parties information that directly identifies an individual such as name, email, telephone, address, or social security number. Magnetic does not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

We use our database to predict your interests so you may be provided with the most relevant advertisements. We may use general health-related terms a user has searched for, such as diet, fitness, or smoking to help determine which ads a user might be interested in and a list can be found [here](http://www.magnetic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Segments.png).

 **2\. COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF DATA ABOUT YOU**

Magnetic uses technical means such as unique identifiers, pixels and cookies that are set on your computer or mobile device to collect, process and use information about browsing activities of internet users on (2.1) third party websites hosted by Magnetic’s business partners; and (2.2) Magnetic’s own websites(s).

 **2.1 Data collected on third party websites**

Magnetic uses tools such as cookies, unique identifiers and pixels to collect data and to deliver personalized advertising on third party websites, which is sometimes referred to as “targeted advertising” or “retargeting”. It is Magnetic’s goal to deliver highly relevant advertisements based on specific online activity related to search and site behavior. The tools mentioned above, including the cookies that will be placed on your computer or mobile device, which may collect IP address and other usage data. If the website you visit is targeted at individuals in the European Economic Area, you may be served with a banner on some publishers’ websites that link to our website. We contractually require publishers to provide notice and obtain appropriate consent, where required by applicable law, for the use of Magnetic technology and cookies described in this section. We encourage you to review the publishers’ privacy policies to learn about their data collection and privacy practices. Magnetic is not liable for any breach or non-compliance with these laws through acts of third parties.

 **2.2 Data collected on Magnetic’s website**

When you contact us via our online contact form available on our site, we may collect your name, title, email address, company name, town/city and state/county to process your inquiry, but we do not use this information to serve you targeted advertising. You may also choose to provide us with this information when you participate in our marketing campaigns and events. We may use this information to follow-up with you and inform you about events, news and other activities that we organize. We do not link this information, or any other information used or intended to be used to identify a particular individual, with data we collect that is linked or reasonably linkable to a particular computer or device, but not to an individual.

In addition, some categories of information may be marked as mandatory in our contact forms and other similar forms. We may not be able to process your inquiry if you decide not to provide the information marked as mandatory.

We also use cookies on the Magnetic website(s) to collect, process or use browsing data which might include your IP address. For further information about the cookies we use, please see our cookie policy. If you need any assistance on how to control cookies, please see <<http://www.aboutcookies.org/default.aspx?page=1>>.

 **3\. CONSUMER CONTROL & OPT OUT OPTIONS**

Consumers have control over whether or not they would like to receive relevant advertisements. You may opt out free of charge* from the processing of information we collect for retargeting.

  *  _ **To opt-out of receiving personalized ads from Magnetic:** Visit _[_http://domdex.com/optout.php_](http://domdex.com/optout.php) _; for more information on opting-out, also see our[cookies policy](http://www.magnetic.com/cookie-policy/)._
  *  _ **You can opt out of receiving personalized ads from Magnetic and other advertising companies:** Visit the consumer choice page “AboutAds” at http://www.aboutads.info/._



However, by opting out that does not mean you will block online advertising altogether or see fewer ads. It simply means that the ads that you see may be far less relevant than prior to opting out. Ads may be served because they relate to the website you are visiting or to your current search, or they may just be randomly placed.

Your choice to opt-out from personalized ads placed by Magnetic will not affect ads placed by any other organization outside of Magnetic. In addition, we comply with opt-out requests by placing an “opt-out cookie” on your computer or device. Consequently, if you clear your cookies on that computer or device, we will not technically be able to read our “opt-out cookie” and will thus resume collecting information from that computer or device for purposes of retargeting. Similarly, an opt-out request will not be effective on other computers or devices you may use if you have not opted out while using that device.

 **4\. SHARING OF INFORMATION**

  * We may share aggregated usage information we collect with publishers, advertisers and our customers so that our partners can improve their offerings and services. We require such third parties by contract not to attempt to merge the information we provide with further information that might directly identify specific individuals without obtaining those individuals’ opt-in consent.
  * We may work with other advertising network providers to help us provide you with relevant ads.
  * We may share the information we collect with third parties acting on our behalf so that they may provide services to us. For example, we use a third party data base provider to store your information. However, we require our service providers by contract to keep the information confidential and secure.
  * We may share the information we collect with a purchaser or potential purchaser of our business.
  * We may share the information we collect where required by law, for example because a court or the police or other law enforcement agency has asked us for it.
  * We may share the information we collect if, as determined in our sole discretion, it is necessary to do so to protect our rights or the rights of others.



 **5\. DATA RETENTION**

Search data is retained and used by Magnetic for ad targeting for up to 90 days. Following the 90-day period, Magnetic archives the data for internal use and research in aggregated form. Visit <http://domdex.com/i> to see information being used for ad personalization.

 **6\. MAGNETIC’S EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH INDUSTRY STANDARDS**

Magnetic is a member of the Digital Advertising Alliance in the United States (DAA) and Canada (DAAC) as well as the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). For more information about how online advertising affects your privacy, see the “Understanding Online Advertising” page on the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website.

 **7\. “DO NOT TRACK” FEATURE**

Some browsers incorporate a “Do Not Track” (DNT) feature. Because there is not yet an accepted standard for how to respond to a DNT signal, we do not currently respond to DNT signals.

 **8\. HOW WE PROTECT THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

We employ security measures to guard the information processed in our systems against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, alteration, disclosure, access or other use and we comply with applicable security requirements. However, despite the measures we take we cannot warrant the security of any information provided to or collected by us.

 **9\. DATA TRANSFERS**

Our services are hosted by servers located in the United States. We may transfer the information we collect about you to countries other than the country in which the information was originally collected for purposes such as storing and processing the information, responding to your inquiries, and operating our services. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country from which the information was initially collected. However, we will endeavour to ensure that the same standards are met in those countries.
