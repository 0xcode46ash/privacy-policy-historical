## Privacy policy

We here at Domesticsale™ care about providing you with the tools and information you need to manage and protect your online privacy. We have developed this privacy policy to inform you about what information this web site collects, who may receive the information, what we may do with the information, and how long we keep it.

 **Cookies**

Domesticsale.com may use "cookies" to obtain non-personal information from our online visitors in order to improve their personal experience while using our site. What is a cookie? It is a tiny element of data that is sent to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return. For example, cookies keep information such as the layout of the page that you prefer, so that when you return to our site your chosen elements are still right there within easy mouse clicks just like you like them. No other companies or persons will ever have access to Domesticsale.com's cookies.

 **Information Collection and Use**

We collect traditional contact information such as your name, mailing address, phone number and e-mail address in order to process your request to place a classified ad on Domesticsale.com. We use this information for a few purposes: to process any credit card charges for your account, to place your ad and to notify you of the login data you will need to place, edit or delete ads. We do not have "marketing partners". We do not give, rent, loan, or otherwise disclose any of your personal information to anyone. Traditional contact information is kept for as long as is legally required. For example, a law may allow you to dispute transactions for a certain time period. We may maintain records of transactions for liability reasons. We do not keep a record of credit card numbers.

 **Confidentiality and Security**

We limit any access to your personal information to only those employees who need that information to provide you with the services we offer on our site.  
We have safeguards (physical, electronic, and procedural) that comply with federal regulations to protect all of your personal information that you provide to use. 

**Accuracy**

If you believe we are not handling your information in accordance with our privacy policy, please contact our customer service department. Contact information is available at contact us page. If, for some reason we have violated our privacy policy, we will correct the error immediately once we become aware of the problem. While we have made every attempt to make this policy as clear as possible, if you have any further questions about it, please [contact us.](https://web.archive.org/contact.shtml)
