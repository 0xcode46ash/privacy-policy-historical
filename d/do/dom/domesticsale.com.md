We have developed this privacy policy to inform you about what information this web site collects, who may receive that information, what we may do with the information, and how long we keep it.

 **Cookies**

DomesticSale.com may use "cookie" technology (a tiny element of data that is sent to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so we can recognize you when you return) only to obtain non-personal information from our online visitors in order to improve their online experience. For example, we store cookies to customize the website for the user on multiple visits. Any other companies or persons do not have access to DomesticSale.com's cookies.

 **Information Collection and Use**

We collect traditional contact information such as your name, mailing address, phone number, e-mail(exclude credit card information) in order to process your request to place an ad to DomesticSale.com's classifieds. We use this information for few purposes: to process credit card charges, to place your ad and to notify you, usually via email, about login data for edit/delete ads. We do not share your information. We do not have "marketing partners". We do not give, rent, loan, or otherwise disclose anything about you to anyone. Traditional contact information is kept for as long as is legally required. For example, a law may allow you to dispute transactions for a certain time period. We may maintain records of transactions for liability reasons.
