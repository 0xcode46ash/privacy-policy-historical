# Domo Privacy Policy | Domo

## Scope of this Policy

Domo, Inc. ("Domo") understands you care how information about you is collected and used. Domo is committed to protecting the privacy of individuals who interact with us. This Domo Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes our privacy practices for our websites, services, and apps that link to this policy. This policy also details our privacy practices related to Domo marketing, advertising and company events.

In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to the Domo hosted services and related apps collectively as our "Services." We will refer to our emails, newsletters, and other marketing and advertising practices collectively as our "Communications."

### Domo Services

We provide Services to our customers. As part of the Services, customer data may be stored on our computer systems. When we provide Services that collect or process customer data, our customers control the data they choose to collect, what customer data is uploaded to the Domo Service, and how that data is used within the Domo Services. Our customers' collection, use, transfer, and retention of customer data in our Services are governed by each customer's privacy policy, not the Domo Privacy Policy. As a data processor, we will cooperate with our customers in their efforts to control their data and comply with applicable law.
