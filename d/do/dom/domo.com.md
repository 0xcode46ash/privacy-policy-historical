In this Privacy Policy, we will refer to the Domo hosted services and related apps collectively as our "Services." We will refer to our emails, newsletters, texts, and other marketing and advertising practices collectively as our "Communications."

## Information collected by Domo

### Domo registration and customer support

You may choose to provide Domo information when you register to use a Domo website or Service, request a Services demonstration, contact Domo for support or other offerings, or attend an event or forum in which Domo is participating. During such processes, Domo collects personal information that identifies you. Domo may collect, for example, your name, company name, address, email, phone number, financial, billing or payment information, position, or title.

### Domo website and use of cookies

Domo receives and stores certain information about how you use our websites and Services when you visit a Domo website or use our Services. For example, we receive information that your browser or device sends to our servers whenever you visit a Domo website. Your browser or device may tell us your internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, computer and connection information such as browser type, version, language and time zone setting, browser plug-in types, operating system, and type of device you are using. When you visit a Domo website, your browser may also tell us information such as the actions you take on our website, the page that led you to our website and, if applicable, the search terms you typed into a search engine that led you to our website.

Domo receives information about how you use our websites and Services through the use of first-party and third-party cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies. Our servers collect similar information when you are logged into our website or Services. The information Domo receives through cookies and similar technologies may be anonymous or it may be associated with you, depending on the website or Services you are using.

### Buttons, tools, and content from other companies

Domo websites and Services include buttons, tools, or content that link to other companies' services (for example, a Facebook "Like" button). We collect information about your use of these features. In addition, when you see or interact with these buttons, tools, or content, or view a Domo web page containing them, some information from your browser may automatically be sent to the other company. Please read that company's privacy policy for more information regarding its use of that information.

### Domo social networking pages

Domo maintains its own pages on many social networking sites. We may collect information when you interact with our social networking pages.

Our customers control what data is collected and how it is used within the Domo Service. Our customers' collection and use of data through the Services we provide to them are governed by our customers' privacy policies. As a data processor, Domo will, as required by law, cooperate with our customers in their efforts to control their data.
