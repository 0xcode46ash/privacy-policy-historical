At Domino's Pizza Australia we want your on-line experience to be enjoyable and we take care to respect your privacy when you visit our web site. As a member of the Australian Direct Marketing Association (ADMA), we abide by a strict Code of Practice that demands we handle your personal details responsibly. 

This Code also requires that we act fairly and honestly in all of our customer transactions. We do this gladly because we know that if you have a good experience with us, you will want to deal with us again... and maybe even tell your friends about us. 

Generally, we use the information we collect about you for two purposes: to facilitate your order and to create a better, more personalised experience for you. Our electronic commerce and privacy standards are derived from the world's best business practices and we abide by the following principles: 

**We Provide Essential Online Information**

  * We provide clear, complete and up-to-date information online about our business and the products and services we offer. This includes how to get in touch with us. This information helps you to make informed choices. 
  * We keep complete and accurate records of online contracts when you accept one of our offers. Our system also helps you to keep an accurate record so there is no confusion about the contract. 
  * If you have a problem with any of our goods or services, we maintain information online about how to make a complaint, obtain redress or pursue dispute resolution. We have put in place an effective mechanism and procedure to help you. We can be e-mailed at [privacy@dominos.com.au](mailto:privacy@dominos.com.au) if there is a problem. 



**We Have A Secure System**

We have learned that customers require peace of mind when it comes to the security of using the Internet. We have taken steps to ensure your personal information is safe by developing and using a secure server that has the most up-to-date encryption (decoding) methods. This means all our customer data is protected against misuse, loss or unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. In addition, we also take steps to destroy or suppress personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose. 

**Information Collection/Use**

  * We only collect customer information that is necessary for what we do. For example, when you place your order, we need to have your name, address, and (if you are paying for delivery by credit card) the number and expiration date of your card. This enables us to process your order and to notify you regarding its status. In addition, we limit the collection of highly sensitive information about customers (e.g., racial, ethnic origin, political opinions, etc.) because, in general, it is not necessary for what we do. 
  * We always tell you who we are and what we intend to do with your information when we receive it. We strive to be open - we will let you know what sort of personal information we hold, how we collect it, how we use and disclose it, if you want to know. 
  * We also ensure that your personal details are accurate, complete and up-to-date when we use or collect them through our verification process. 
  * We only collect personal information by lawful and fair means. This means we are never unreasonably intrusive when it comes to dealing with our customers. From time to time, we may also collect non-personal information from our customers. This helps us in our ongoing efforts to improve our service and experience for our customers. We also monitor our customers' usage of our web site to make improvements and provide other items you might want to know about. 
  * As much as possible, we will collect your information directly from you. If we collect details about you from someone else, we will, whenever possible, make sure you know we have done this and why. 



**We Will Respect Your Preferences**

  * We may also use the information we collect to keep you abreast of changes in our web site, to inform you about new products and services, or to let you know about special offers you might find worthwhile. If you would rather not receive this information, you can visit our web site or call out toll-free number and let us know. 
  * We always provide customers with an opportunity to opt-out of receiving future offers via traditional post or e-mail. If you don't wish to receive new information, just let us know by sending your name and address details to [privacy@dominos.com.au](mailto:privacy@dominos.com.au) or phoning this free-call number and we will delete your details from all internal marketing lists and future campaigns. 



**Offering Information to Other Parties**

  * We only use or disclose information about our customers in ways they would expect. This means we only use information to process your order or to improve our web site. In terms of disclosure, there is only one instance where your name and address might leave our system. From time to time, we might pass your contact details to a few select companies whose products or services we feel you might like to know about. We know that many of our customers enjoy receiving these excellent offers. If you do not want your name traded, please e-mail us and we will block any transfer of your details to a third party. 
  * If you do agree to have your details transferred, be reassured: we take steps to protect our customers' privacy if we transfer personal information about them to other organisations. 



**Let Us Know What You Think**

Privacy is a sensitive issue. At anytime, if you believe we have not adhered to these principles, please let us know us by e-mail at [privacy@dominos.com.au](mailto:privacy@dominos.com.au) and we will make every effort to review and correct the problem. We also welcome your questions and comments about privacy and our Code of Practice.
