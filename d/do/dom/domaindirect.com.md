# Domain Name Registration and Web Hosting from Domain Direct

**Security and Privacy Statement**

* * *

## Security Policy

**Domain Direct** has created a state-of-the-art, real-time transaction system, that uses industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, as well as private links to international banking networks, to ensure your information is quickly and securely authorized and processed.

Your credit card information is protected in two ways. First of all, as a result of the SSL-based encryption, your card number is ALWAYS secure during transmission. A visual means of confirming this is for you to watch the small padlock icon in your browser. While on any page where financial information is to be entered, this icon will change to a locked state, denoting a secure page. This security measure is privately audited by an independent third-party, Geotrust, whose icon you can click on from any secured page to confirm its secure status.

Secondly, our private links to banking networks ensure that your sensitive information is ALWAYS secure once we have received it. All the information traveling on our banking network is guaranteed 100% secure - in fact, it's more heavily-encrypted than your private telephone conversations!

Domain Direct actively works with international banking institutions and law enforcement to discover and prosecute cases of fraudulent credit card use. All connections to, and transactions within Domain Direct are logged and regularly audited. WE USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE TO US TO PURSUE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST PERSONS ATTEMPTING FRAUD OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS, IN ALL ICPO/INTERPOL JURISDICTIONS.

## Private Information Policy

We appreciate that many users do not feel comfortable providing their real address, due to the the high incidence of junk mail we all suffer from. Our privacy guarantee specifically states that we will **NOT** share, barter, sell, or trade your confidential information with ANYONE, under ANY circumstances (except in the case of legal proceedings). From time to time, Domain Direct may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning our services. These communications are intended to inform you of important information regarding your account, or about general services provided by Domain Direct. If you do not want to receive email from us regarding new services, please click the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email you receive from Domain Direct. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we will continue to send you emails regarding your account administration, as well as any necessary information, such as renewal instructions. Also, ICANN regulations require that your contact information be included in the publicly-accessible WhoIs database; if it is not included, you can lose your domain. Note that this will not include your credit card information, the contents or location of your Website, or any email address other than your direct contact address. An example of the information which will be displayed is as follows:
