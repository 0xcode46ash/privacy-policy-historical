# Domain names and Web hosting from Domain Direct

**Security and Privacy Statement**

* * *

## Security Policy

**Domain Direct** has created a state-of-the-art, real-time transaction system, that uses industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption, as well as private links to international banking networks, to ensure your information is quickly and securely authorized and processed.

Your credit card information is protected in two ways. First of all, as a result of the SSL-based encryption, your card number is ALWAYS secure during transmission. A visual means of confirming this is for you to watch the small padlock icon in your browser. While on any page where financial information is to be entered, this icon will change to a locked state, denoting a secure page. This security measure is privately audited by an independent third-party, Geotrust, whose icon you can click on from any secured page to confirm its secure status.

Secondly, our private links to banking networks ensure that your sensitive information is ALWAYS secure once we have received it. All the information traveling on our banking network is guaranteed 100% secure - in fact, it's more heavily-encrypted than your private telephone conversations!

Domain Direct actively works with international banking institutions and law enforcement to discover and prosecute cases of fraudulent credit card use. All connections to, and transactions within Domain Directare logged and regularly audited. WE USE ALL MEANS AVAILABLE TO US TO PURSUE CRIMINAL PROSECUTION AGAINST PERSONS ATTEMPTING FRAUD OR UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OUR SYSTEMS, IN ALL ICPO/INTERPOL JURISDICTIONS.

## Private Information Policy

We appreciate that many users do not feel comfortable providing their real address, due to the the high incidence of junk mail we all suffer from. Our privacy guarantee specifically states that we will **NOT** share, barter, sell, or trade your confidential information with ANYONE, under ANY circumstances (except in the case of legal proceedings). From time to time, Domain Direct may use your personal information to contact you by electronic mail concerning our services. These communications are intended to inform you of important information regarding your account, or about general services provided by Domain Direct. If you do not want to receive email from us regarding new services, please click the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email you receive from Domain Direct. However, in order to fulfill our service obligations to you, we will continue to send you emails regarding your account administration, as well as any necessary information, such as renewal instructions. Also, ICANN regulations require that your contact information be included in the publicly-accessible WhoIs database; if it is not included, you can lose your domain. Note that this will not include your credit card information, the contents or location of your Website, or any email address other than your direct contact address. An example of the information which will be displayed is as follows:

The Data in the Tucows Registrar WHOIS database is provided to you by Tucows  
for information purposes only, and may be used to assist you in obtaining  
information about or related to a domain name's registration record.

Tucows makes this information available "as is," and does not guarantee its  
accuracy.

By submitting a WHOIS query, you agree that you will use this data only for  
**lawful purposes and that, under no circumstances will you use this data to:**  
a) allow, enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail,  
telephone, or facsimile of mass, unsolicited, commercial advertising or  
solicitations to entities other than the data recipient's own existing  
customers; or (b) enable high volume, automated, electronic processes that  
send queries or data to the systems of any Registry Operator or  
ICANN-Accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register  
domain names or modify existing registrations.

The compilation, repackaging, dissemination or other use of this Data is  
expressly prohibited without the prior written consent of Tucows.

Tucows reserves the right to terminate your access to the Tucows WHOIS  
database in its sole discretion, including without limitation, for excessive  
querying of the WHOIS database or for failure to otherwise abide by this  
policy.

Tucows reserves the right to modify these terms at any time.

By submitting this query, you agree to abide by these terms.

**NOTE:** THE WHOIS DATABASE IS A CONTACT DATABASE ONLY. LACK OF A DOMAIN  
RECORD DOES NOT SIGNIFY DOMAIN AVAILABILITY.
