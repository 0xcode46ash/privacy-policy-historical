# Privacy Statement | Domu Chicago

**What information is collected**

Once you land on any page of the domu website you disclose your IP address and certain information about your computing, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using and the page that you were referred from.  You should assume that this information will be preserved.

If all you ever do on domu is search for a chicago apartment, then no other information will be collected from you.  To take advantage of certain functionalities offered by the website, however, you will need to supply additional information:

If you want to save your searches, you will need to supply an e-mail address and password.

If you would like to contact a landlord using our web form, you will need to supply an e-mail address.

If you want  to send a listing to a friend, you will need to supply your own e-mail address, as well as your friend’s e-mail address.

If you wish to list an apartment for rent, you will need to supply an e-mail address, a password, and a credit card number with name and billing address.

**Who receives the information**

All e-mail addresses and passwords are received and stored by domu in encrypted form.  This includes not only your own e-mail address, but any other address that you transmit through a web form.  If you share a listing or contact a landlord using a web form, any information you place in the web form will be visible to the recipient.

Any information that you supply in the course of a credit card transaction is transmitted to our payment processor, Chase Paymentech, through its orbital payment gateway using secure socket layer technology.  Chase Paymentech is subject to the detailed rules and regulations of the various credit and debit card organizations and networks relating to the security and safeguarding of cardholder data, including the payment card industry data security standards (PCI DSS).  For more on this, please visit [Chase Paymentech](http://www.chasepaymentech.com/), scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the link to its privacy policy.  Credit card numbers are not stored with domu, although domu maintains the name and address associated with the credit card, as well as the transaction amount and transaction identification number.  Domu may access credit card numbers through the Orbital payment gateway, but those numbers remain with the payment processor.

**How the information may be used**

Anytime you supply an e-mail address (or a friend’s e-mail address) domu may use it to communicate with you about matters believed to be of interest to you.  Should domu ever do so, it will provide you the opportunity to opt out of future communications.

Domu may also use your e-mail address to communicate with you regarding specific transactions you engage in on the site.  For example:

Whenever you establish an account, domu will send you an e-mail confirming that the account has been created.

If you save a search, domu will periodically alert you to newly-listed chicago apartments matching your search criteria, although you have the option to set preferences on how often you would like to be notified of new search results, including the preference not to be contacted at all.

If you activate a listing for a chicago apartment, domu will confirm the receipt of your credit card payment and may later alert you when your listing is about to expire or remind you of your ability to renew it.

Domu does not accept advertisements (other than listings) and does not disclose e-mail addresses to third-parties, subject to the exceptions set forth in the next paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, domu reserves the right to disclose any data or information in its possession (or to use your e-mail address) when required by law or legal process or when domu believes in good faith that such disclosure (or use) is necessary to  _(i)_ enforce the terms of service, _(ii)_ respond to claims that any user-generated content violates the rights of third-parties, or  _(iii)_ protect the safety or property of domu, its users, or members of the public.

**Cookies and Google Analytics**

Domu uses cookies to enhance the user experience and to understand the way in which the website is used.  Domu also uses Google Analytics as a tool for tracking and analyzing its web traffic.  Google Analytics runs on the domu server and uses a combination of first-party cookies and Javascript code to compile information that is synthesized into reports about page visits, referring sites, user habits, and the like.  Google is not provided access to any user information other than IP addresses.  If you are concerned that Google Analytics is used at thousands of the most popular internet sites, enabling google to to track your browsing habits across multiple domains, then you are not alone, and we suggest that you consult Google’s[ Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html).  For an explanation on how Google Analytics works, [click here](http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/).  For excellent insight into the types of reports that Google Analytics creates for its customers, [click here](http://www.butkaj.com/statistics?id_menu=749).

**Security**

E-mail addresses, passwords, credit card information, messages transmitted in web forms, and other user-generated content of a confidential nature in domu’s possession will be accessible only to authorized personnel at domu.  The domu website is hosted at Acquia, and domu cannot guarantee that information will not be intercepted from the website or that security breaches will not occur.

This privacy policy applies solely to your dealings with domu.  Once you leave the domu domain, your online actions will be subject to the privacy policy, if any, of the new website you enter, even if you reached that website by following a link from domu.  This privacy policy may be updated from time-to-time, and domu recommends that you periodically revisit this page to keep yourself apprised of any changes.
