**What information does Domu collect?**

When you visit the Domu website, you disclose your IP address and certain information about your computing, such as the type of browser and operating system you are using and the page that referred you to our site.  Domu may preserve this information.

If you use Domu solely to browse listings, then Domu will not collect any additional information from you.  But to take advantage of certain functionalities offered by the website, you will need to supply additional information.  For example,

To save your searches, you must share your e-mail address and create a password;

To send a listing to a friend, you must share your e-mail address as well as your friend’s;

To post an apartment for rent, you must share an e-mail address, create a password, and provide a valid credit card number with name and billing address.

**Who receives the information**

Any e-mail addresses and passwords recevied through Domu.com and stored by Domu are encrypted.  This includes not only your own e-mail address, but any other address that you transmit through a web form.  If you share a listing or contact a landlord using a web form, any information you place in the web form will be visible to the recipient.

Any information that you supply in the course of a credit card transaction is transmitted to our payment processor, Chase Paymentech, through its orbital payment gateway using secure socket layer technology.  Chase Paymentech is subject to the detailed rules and regulations of the various credit and debit card organizations and networks relating to the security and safeguarding of cardholder data, including the payment card industry data security standards (PCI DSS).  For more on this, please visit Chase Paymentech, scroll to the bottom of the page and click on the link to its privacy policy.  Credit card numbers are not stored with domu, although domu maintains the name and address associated with the credit card, as well as the transaction amount and transaction identification number.  Domu may access credit card numbers through the Orbital payment gateway, but those numbers remain with the payment processor.

**How the information may be used**

Anytime you supply an e-mail address (or a friend’s e-mail address) domu may use it to communicate with you about matters believed to be of interest to you.  Should Domu ever do so, it will provide you the opportunity to opt out of future communications.

Domu may also use your e-mail address to communicate with you regarding specific transactions you engage in on the site.  For example:

Whenever you establish an account, Domu will send you an e-mail confirming that the account has been created.

If you save a search, Domu will periodically alert you to newly-listed Chicago apartments matching your search criteria, although you have the option to set preferences on how often you would like to be notified of new search results, including the preference not to be contacted at all.

If you activate a listing for a Chicago apartment, Domu will confirm the receipt of your credit card payment and may later alert you when your listing is about to expire or remind you of your ability to renew it.

Domu does not accept advertisements (other than listings) and does not disclose e-mail addresses to third-parties, subject to the exceptions set forth in the next paragraph.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, Domu reserves the right to disclose any data or information in its possession (or to use your e-mail address) when required by law or legal process or when Domu believes in good faith that such disclosure (or use) is necessary to  _(i)_ enforce the terms of service, _(ii)_ respond to claims that any user-generated content violates the rights of third-parties, or  _(iii)_ protect the safety or property of Domu, its users, or members of the public.
