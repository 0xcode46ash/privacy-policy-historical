## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Do512 we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.
  * In our products, we aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

Do512, LLC. (“ **Do512** ”) operates the website Do512.com. It is Do512's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Do512 collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Do512’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Do512’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Do512 may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Do512 also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Do512 does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Do512’s websites choose to interact with Do512 in ways that require Do512 to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Do512 gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at Do512.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Do512 – by purchasing access to a premium account, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Do512 collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Do512. Do512 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Do512 may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Do512 may monitor the most popular events on the Do512.com site. Do512 may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Do512 does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Do512 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Do512’s behalf or to provide services available at Do512’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Do512’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Do512 will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Do512 discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Do512 believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Do512, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Do512 website and have supplied your email address, Do512 may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Do512 and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Do512 takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Do512 uses cookies to help Do512 identify and track visitors, their usage of Do512 website, and their website access preferences. Do512 visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Do512’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Do512’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Ads

Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Do512 and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Do512 may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Do512’s sole discretion. Do512 encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
