## Dobbies.com is committed to protecting your privacy. This page explains how we use any   
information you give to us and the ways in which we protect your personal data. If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us at customer.service@dobbies.com.

  
**The Data Protection Act**   
Under the Data Protection Act 1998, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies to safeguard your data, with strict security standards and processes to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We will never pass on your details to any third party unless you give us explicit permission to do so.

**Information we Collect**   
We collect the details provided by you on registration together with information we learn about you from your use of our service and your visits to our web site.  We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site use which enables us to improve the service we provide to you.

From time to time we may collect additional information from you in any promotions that we offer and any information you provide when giving us feedback, subscribing to our Gardening Club or contacting our Customer Service Centre.

If you opt to receive email updates from Dobbies, the registration information we collect is kept securely by us and any secure partner we may use to assist us in contacting you and will be held until such time that you unsubscribe or inform us otherwise.  This information is stored to allow us to send information about Dobbies that may be of interest to you and will never be given to any other party without your consent (other than secure partners that we may use to assist us in contacting you).

**Cookies**   
Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. We use cookies for a number of purposes, including enabling us to simplify the identification process for registered users, to ensure the security and authenticity of registered users, to provide the mechanisms for online shopping and to enable traffic monitoring.

Non-registered visitors of the site are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and shopping behaviour. We may also use anonymous cookies if you have reached Dobbies.com through an affiliate website to analyse the effectiveness of our marketing and to track any payments to those affiliates.

**Credit Card Transaction and Security**   
For your security, authorisation for purchases will be checked with the credit card company before goods are dispatched. In addition our 128-bit secure server software (known as Secure Sockets Layer or SSL) is the industry standard and uses the best technology available to encrypt all of your personal information, including credit card number and your personal details, so that these cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

**Access rights**   
You have a right to see any personal data which we may hold about you. To obtain a copy of this, please write to us at the following address: Head of Ecommerce, Dobbies.com, Melville Nursery, Lasswade, Midlothian, EH18 1AZ, enclosing your postal details and a cheque for £12 payable to Dobbies Garden Centres plc to cover the cost of locating this data and sending it to you.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**   
If this privacy policy changes, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, and how we use it.
