# Dobbies garden centre, furniture & plants, home & garden equipment UK

## This page explains how www.dobbies.com, which is managed by Dobbies Garden Centres plc, uses any information you give to us, and the ways in which we protect your privacy.

**The Data Protection Act**   
Under the Data Protection Act 1998, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you. We use leading technologies to safeguard your data, and keep strict security standards to prevent any unauthorised access to it. We do not pass on your details to any third party unless you give us permission to do so.

**What information do we collect?**   
We collect four kinds of information from visitors to dobbies.co.uk: Registration details for email updates, application details to join the Dobbies Gardening Club, subscription details for Dobbies Gardening Club and server log files.

**Register for email updates**   
If you opt to register for email updates from Dobbies, the registration information we collect is: your name, your location, email address, your nearest Dobbies Garden Centre and whether or not youâ€™d like to receive Dobbies corporate information.

A copy of this information is kept securely by Dobbies and our technology supplier, Ednet and will be held until such time you unsubscribe or inform Dobbies otherwise. This information is stored to allow us to send information about Dobbies that may be of interest to you and will not be shared with any other party. This information is also stored on back-up tapes to avoid loss of data.

**Dobbies Gardening Club and Gardening Club subscriptions**   
If you opt to apply to join Dobbies Gardening Club, the information we collect is: your name, address and email address. If the membership is for a friend we will collect their name, address and email address. We will also collect information from a short questionnaire of multiple-choice questions to help us respond better to your needs.

This information is stored to allow us to send Dobbies Gardening Club information and email updates to you and will not be shared with any other party. A copy of this information is kept securely by Dobbies and our technology supplier, Ednet and will be held until such time you inform Dobbies otherwise. This information is also stored on back-up tapes to avoid loss of data.

Credit or debit card information will be used as a financial transaction for your Gardening Club application, but will not be held by Dobbies after successful authorisation of the transaction.

**Log files**   
Log files allow us to record visitors' use of the website. Ednet puts together log file information from all our visitors, which we use to make changes to the layout of the site and to the information in it, based on the way that visitors move around and interact with it. Log files do not contain any personal information.

**Credit card transaction and security**   
For your security, authorisation for purchases will be checked with the credit card company before goods are despatched. In addition to our credit card policy, our secure server software (SSL) is the industry standard and among the best software available today. It encrypts all of your personal information, including credit card number, name and address so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.

**Changes to this privacy policy**   
If this privacy policy changes in any way, we will place an updated version on this page. Regularly reviewing this page ensures you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties.
