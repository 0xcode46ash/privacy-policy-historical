# Privacy Policy : Donuts Inc.

Donuts Inc. ("Donuts") is committed to protecting the privacy of those who register domain names (“Registrants”) and make use of its Internet domain name registry services (the “Services”).  Donuts will handle personal data provided to it by registrars and Registrants in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY.  BY ACCESSING OR USING THE SERVICES, YOU EXPRESSLY AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS DESCRIBED HEREIN AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES.

Donuts reserves the right to modify this Privacy Policy from time to time without notice, such changes will be available on the Donuts website at [http://www.donuts.co](http://www.donuts.co/).  Each time you access or use the Services, you will be bound by the then‐effective Privacy Policy. 

## External Websites

The Donuts website and the Services may contain links to external websites.  Donuts is not responsible for and cannot control the content or privacy practices of other entities.  These entities may have their own privacy policies and we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies.  Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to their websites. 

## Use of the Internet

The transmission of information via the Internet is not completely secure.  Further, communicating via the Internet and other electronic means necessarily involves personal information passing through or being handled by third parties such as Internet service providers.  Although Donuts will do its best to protect personal data, Donuts cannot guarantee the security of the information transmitted and any transmission of information is at your own risk. 

## Information Collected and Whois Service

Donuts collects certain data from its contracted registrars.  Such data includes domain name registration information provided by Registrants to registrars, including, but not limited to: registered domain name, nameserver delegation, Registrant name, contact name, address, phone number, email address, and IP address (“Whois Data”).  While Donuts will comply with all requirements related to the accuracy of Whois Data under its registry agreements with the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“ICANN”), Donuts cannot guarantee that all personal data received is accurate or up‐to-date and will not, therefore, be responsible for any inaccuracies.

To support the security of the Internet and ensure continuity in service, Donuts is required to maintain a service that provides Whois Data (the “Whois Service”).  The Whois Service is available to any Internet user, and its use does not require prior authorization or permission.  For example, the Whois Service discloses Whois Data to third parties to ascertain the Registrant or the registrar of a domain in cases of (i) technical problems that might occur when accessing its domain; (ii) assisting law enforcement authorities in investigations, crime prevention, and matters of national security; (iii) helping to counter the infringement of third-party legal rights; (iv) preventing fraud; and (v) other lawful queries.  In essence, Registrant Whois Data is publicly available upon request.  In case of a registrar’s failure, loss of registrar accreditation, court order, or other emergency event that prompts the temporary or definitive transfer of domain names from one registrar to another registrar, Donuts may provide ICANN or another third party with Whois Data.

More information on the Whois Service is available in the Acceptable Use and Anti-Abuse Policy and Whois Access Policy, both available on the Donuts website. 

## Other Use of and Access to Personal Data

Donuts shall take all reasonable steps to protect personal data collected from loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration, or destruction.  Personal data supplied to Donuts will not be given, sold, rented, loaned, or otherwise disclosed to any third parties outside of Donuts, except when Donuts has express permission or under special circumstances, such as when Donuts believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with legal processes; (ii) enforce or comply with agreements between Donuts and ICANN; (iii) enforce or comply with agreements between Donuts and registrars; (iv) comply with policies adopted from time to time by Donuts and posted under “Policies” on the Donuts website; or (v) protect the rights, property, or personal  safety of Donuts, its contracted parties, customers, or the public.

Donuts may share zone file data (such as domain names and name servers) to third parties for lawful purposes.  Donuts may also share personal data with vendors, escrow agents, consultants and other service providers (“Service Providers”) engaged by or working with Donuts and who need access to such information to carry out their work for Donuts.  Donuts is not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor is Donuts responsible for any additional information provided directly to these Service Providers or other third parties by registrars or Registrants.

Donuts may from time to time use data submitted by registrars for statistical analysis, provided that any such analysis will not disclose individual non-public personal data and such non-public personal data only is used for internal business purposes. 

## Protection of Personal Data

Donuts has endeavored to put into place and maintain reasonable security measures in an effort to protect the security of non-public personal information while it is under Donuts’ control.  Please be aware, however, that despite Donuts’ best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. 

## Transfer of Ownership

We reserve the right to transfer ownership of Donuts, its subsidiaries, or the Services (including the personal data collected by Donuts) to a third party in the event of a sale, merger, liquidation, receivership or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of us, a subsidiary or line of business associated with Donuts.  Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. 

## User Contact – Opt-out
