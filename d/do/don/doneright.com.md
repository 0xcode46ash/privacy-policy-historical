# DoneRight.com - Privacy Policy

|  OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY  |   
  |  | 

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, your sole remedy is to cease using the Done Right!™ services and to not submit any information to the site. 

|    
  |  CHANGES TO THE POLICY  |    
  |  | 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our website. Your continued use of the services following the posting of any such change shall constitute your acceptance thereof. 

|    
  |  THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT  |    
  |  | 

This notice applies to all information collected by us. Some of the types of information that we may collect include, but are not limited to: 

  * Your name
  * Telephone number 
  * Address 
  * Email address 
  * Gender
  * Age
  * Consumer interests
  * Online preferences

  |  HOW WE COLLECT & USE INFORMATION  |    
  |  | 

We collect the information detailed above that you submit to us and that we determine from other sources, such as your use of certain telephone numbers, your own telephone number, and by other lawful methods. 

When you call one of our approved Done Right Service Providers using a number marketed by Done Right, the Service Provider you call very often receives a record of the phone number you called from and, by the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Done Right Site and Service User Agreement, is allowed to call you back. Once you have established contact with a Done Right Service Provider you are no longer just a customer of Done Right, but also of the Service Providers’ and are subject to the Service Providers’ own marketing policies and practices for which Done Right bears no responsibility. 

Prior to calling a Done Right Service Provider, your contact information will not be supplied to any Done Right Service Provider. Once you have called a Done Right Service Provider using a number marketed by Done Right, the Service Provider you called may, as described in the paragraph above, receive your contact information. If the Service Provider you called has been de-listed, suspended or has otherwise exited the Done Right Program before we are able to effectively stop marketing the Service Providers’ number, we may supply your contact information to a Done Right Service Provider in-good-standing who offers the same class of service(s).

Overall, we use your information to provide you with various promotional materials and information pertaining to products and/or services that we have identified you may be interested in, and to measure the effectiveness of our service in helping match Done Right’s approved Service Providers with consumers who need their services. 

We may also share your information with third parties we approve of, and that we believe may have information or provide goods and/or services that we have identified you may be interested in. Though, unlike the Service Providers listed in the Done Right Directory™, who you called, these third parties – with the exception of market research vendors we hire to learn more about our service – cannot contact you directly without your expressed written consent. 

The phone number you supply us with to secure the benefits of the Done Right Guarantee™ will not be supplied by us to any Done Right Service Provider unless you have previously called that Service Provider using a number listed in one of Done Right’s various marketing vehicles. We use the collected information to alert you regarding important changes to our services, including our websites. 

We use your return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. 

We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design the services we offer you, and we may share non-identifying and aggregate information with third parties we approve of. 

|    
  |  OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY  |    
  |  | 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable collected information by sending us a request (to [info@doneright.com](mailto:info@doneright.com)) that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.
