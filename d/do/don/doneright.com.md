# DoneRight.com - Privacy Policy

OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY   
| 

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way we collect and use information. If you do not agree with the terms of this policy, your sole remedy is to cease using the Done Right!® services and to refrain i) from calling any Done Right! Service Providers using a number marketed by Done Right! and ii) from submitting any information to us through interaction with our website or those portions of other parties' websites that offer our services (which we refer to as "Done Right! Designated Areas")   
  
WHAT THIS POLICY COVERS   
| 

This policy applies to the information that Done Right! receives when you contact a Done Right! Service Provider through a means provided by Done Right!, and when you interact with our website or a Done Right! Designated Area. It does not govern how any Done Right! Service Provider whom you contact uses the information that it receives, or how the operator of any website on which a Done Right! Designated Area appears uses the information that it receives. Those third parties' use of the information that they receive is governed by their privacy policies.   
  
CHANGES TO THE POLICY   
| 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our website. Your continued use of the services following the posting of any such change shall constitute your acceptance thereof.   
  
THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT   
| 

This notice applies to all information collected by us. Some of the types of information that we may collect include, but are not limited to: 

  * Your name
  * Telephone number 
  * Address 
  * Email address 
  * Gender
  * Age
  * Consumer interests
  * Online preferences
  * Types of services needed
  * Service Providers contacted
  * Reviews of Service Providers

  
HOW WE COLLECT & USE INFORMATION   
| 

We collect the information detailed above that you submit to us and that we determine from other sources, such as your use of certain telephone numbers, your own telephone number, and by other lawful methods.

When you contact (by phone or Internet) one of our approved Done Right! Service Providers through Done Right!, the Service Provider you contact very often receives a record of the phone number you called from and, by the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Done Right! Site and Service User Agreement, is allowed to call you back. As indicated above, once you establish contact with a Done Right! Service Provider you are no longer just a customer of Done Right!, but also a customer of the Service Provider. As a result, you become subject to the Service Provider's own marketing and privacy policies and practices (for which Done Right! bears no responsibility).

Prior to your contacting a Done Right! Service Provider, your contact information will not be supplied to any Done Right! Service Provider. Once you have called a Done Right! Service Provider through Done Right!, the Service Provider you called may, as described in the paragraph above, receive your contact information. If the Service Provider you contacted has been de-listed, suspended or has otherwise exited the Done Right! Program before we are able to effectively stop marketing the Service Provider, we may supply your contact information to a Done Right! Service Provider in-good-standing who offers the same class of service(s).

Overall, we use your information to provide you with various promotional materials and information pertaining to products and/or services that we have identified you may be interested in, and to measure the effectiveness of our service in helping match Done Right! Service Providers with consumers who need their services.

We may also share your information with third parties we approve of, and that we believe may have information or provide goods and/or services that we have identified you may be interested in. Though, unlike the Service Providers listed in the Done Right! Directory¨, who you called, these third parties Ð with the exception of market research vendors we hire to learn more about our service Ð cannot contact you directly without your expressed written consent.

The phone number you supply us with to secure the benefits of the Done Right! Guarantee¨ will not be supplied by us to any Done Right! Service Provider unless you have previously called that Service Provider using a number listed in one of Done Right!'s various marketing vehicles. We use the collected information to alert you regarding important changes to our services, including our websites.

We use your return e-mail address(es) to answer the e-mail we receive.

We also use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design the services we offer you, and we may share non-identifying and aggregate information with third parties we approve of.  
  
OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY   
| 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. 

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable collected information by sending us a request (to [info@doneright.com](mailto:info@doneright.com)) that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.   
  
COLLECTION AND USE OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION   
| 

Our systems, including our web servers, may automatically collect limited information about you and your computer configuration when you use the service or visit our web site. This information may include your telephone number, information about your computer such as the type of web browser software you use, the operating system you're running, the resolution of your computer monitor, the referring website, and your IP address. We may use your computer's IP address for systems administration and trouble shooting purposes. We may use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our web site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site. 

Our website uses cookies (small files that reside on your computer) and other technical methods to keep track of various items such as whether you are interested in a particular product, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your user name so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Some of our advertisers and third party partners also may use cookies and other technical methods on our site in connection with the services they offer. We have no control over these cookies, and we may not have access to the information these advertisers collect. You may choose not to accept cookies by setting your browser to refuse all cookies or to notify you each time a cookie is set. However, if you choose to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all features of our web site.   
  
RECORDING OF CALLS   
| 

We may, occasionally, record the calls placed to our approved Service Providers to ensure that calls are answered in a prompt and professional manner and for other quality control purposes. Whenever there is a chance that a call may be recorded, the caller hears a message advising that "this call may be recorded for quality purposes." The calls are used by us and our approved research vendors and are never made available to the public, but an anonymous transcript or summary may be shared with our approved Service Providers in an effort to help them improve their business practices.   
  
CHILDREN

Our website is not directed at children under the age of 13. We prohibit registration by children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS   
| 

We have relationships with many companies throughout the world. You should read the privacy policies of these third parties and decide whether or not to continue using the services based upon their privacy policies. NO THIRD-PARTY SITES, INCLUDING SITES ON WHICH DONE RIGHT! DESIGNATED AREAS APPEAR, ARE COVERED BY OUR PRIVACY POLICY.   
  
INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY

In any event, this Privacy Policy may not be applicable in all countries where web sites are accessible, as security policies may vary according to the individual Internet laws in each host country.
