**DocVerse.com Privacy Policy**

**Last Updated: January 13, 2009**

At DocVerse ("DocVerse," "we," or "us"), we value your privacy. This privacy policy describes our collection of personal information from users of our website and service at www.DocVerse.com (collectively, the "Site"), as well as our use and disclosure of that information. By using our Site, you consent to the collection and use of personal information in accordance with this policy.

**Personal Information**

"Personal information," as used in this policy, is information that specifically identifies an individual, such as an individual's name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. Personal information also includes information about an individual's activities, such as information about his or her activity on the Site, and demographic information, such as date of birth, gender, geographic area, and preferences, when any of this information is linked to personal information that identifies that individual.

Personal information does not include "aggregate" information. Aggregate information is information that we collect about a group or category of products, services or customers that is not personally identifiable or from which individual identities are removed. We may use and disclose aggregate information for various purposes.

**Collection of Information**

_Automatic Information Collection_

We may automatically collect certain information from you by analyzing your use of the Site, such as your IP address, browser type, pages accessed, and duration of visit. This information does not necessarily enable us to personally identify you. If it does, it is treated as personal information under this policy. Additionally, if we associate or combine this information with personal information, we will treat the associated or combined information as personal information under this policy.

"Cookies" are one means of automatic information collection that we may use. A "cookie" is a small text file containing a string of characters. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more cookies to your browser in order to identify it uniquely. We may use cookies to improve the quality of our Site and our services by tracking user trends, store user preferences, and customize your experience. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please be aware, however, that some services may not function properly if cookies are disabled.

_Collection of Voluntarily Provided Information_

We collect personal information that users provide to us in a variety of ways on the Site. For instance, when visitors to our Site register for an account or otherwise communicate with us via the Site, we collect the personal information that is provided to us. We may collect personal information such as name, e-mail address, postal address, demographic information, profile information, and other types of personal information in these manners. 

**Use of Personal Information**

We may use personal information to provide services and information that you request; to enhance, improve, operate, and maintain the Site, our programs, services, website, and other systems; to prevent fraudulent use of our Site and services; to tailor your user experience; to maintain a record of our dealings with you, and for other administrative purposes **.**

We may also use personal information to contact you regarding products, services, events, programs, and offers that we believe you may find of interest. We allow you to opt-out from receiving marketing communications from us as described in the "Choice" section below.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

We are not in the business of selling personal information about our users to third parties. We may disclose personal information to third-party service providers (e.g., payment processing and data storage and processing facilities) that assist us in our work. We limit the personal information provided to these service providers to that reasonably necessary for them to perform their functions. 

We may also disclose personal information if we believe that doing so is legally required or is in our interest to protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement of our agreements), or the rights or property of others.

In addition, information about our users, including personal information, may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, debt financing or sale of company assets, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information could be transferred to third parties as one of our business assets.

**Profile Data and Other Personal Information Available to Other Users of the Site**

Some features on the Site may allow you to post personal information that is available to other users of the Site. Any information that you make available in your profile will be available to other users. Any personal information that you make available in your profile is at your sole risk. We may allow you to select privacy options that limit access to some types of personal information, but no security measures are impenetrable or perfect. We also cannot control the actions of other users with whom you may choose to share personal information, whether you share it on the Site or by other means (such as email or telephone). Additionally, even after information posted on the Site is removed, caching and archiving services may have saved that information, and other users or third parties may have copied or stored the information available on the Site. We cannot, and do not, warrant or guarantee that any personal information that you provide on and in connection with the Site will not be accessed, viewed, or used by unauthorized persons.

**Choice**

If you receive commercial email from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions contained within the email. You may also opt-out from receiving commercial email from us by sending us an email or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.

Additionally, if you do not wish to be notified by telephone or postal mail regarding products, services, events, programs, and offers that we believe you may find of interest, you may opt-out from such communications by sending us an email or by writing to us at the address given at the end of this policy.

**Links**

For your convenience, the Site may contain links to other Web sites, products, or services that we do not own or operate. If you choose to visit or use any third-party products or services, please be aware that this policy will not apply to your activities or any information you disclose while interacting with third parties.

**Children**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. By providing personal information to **** us through our Site, you represent that you are 13 years of age or older.

**International Visitors**

Our Site is hosted in the United States and is generally intended for United States visitors. If you visit from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please be aware that you are transferring Personal Information to the United States. The United States does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and some other regions. By providing Personal Information to us, you consent to the transfer of it to the United States and the use of it in accordance with this policy.

**Security**

We use security measures that are reasonably designed to protect Personal Information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Please note, however, that no data security measures can be guaranteed to be completely effective. Consequently, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal information or other information. You transmit personal information to us at your own risk. 

**Updates to this Policy**

We may occasionally update this policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the beginning of the policy. Your continued use of this Site after such changes will be subject to the then-current policy. If we make changes to this policy that are materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of personal information we have collected, we will attempt to obtain your consent before implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this policy to stay informed about how we collect, use, and disclose personal information.
