# DocuSign Privacy Policy

[](http://web.ita.doc.gov/safeharbor/shlist.nsf/%20webPages/safe+harbor+list)The privacy practices of this statement apply to our services available under the domain and sub domains of www.docusign.com (the "Site") (including docusign.net, docusignexpress.com, and docusign-inc.com). By visiting this website you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree please do not use or access our Site or products. 

This Privacy Policy describes the information, as part of the normal operation of our services, we collect from you and what may happen to that information. Although this policy may seem long, we have prepared a detailed policy because we believe you should know as much as possible about DocuSign's practices so that you can make informed decisions.

By accepting the Privacy Policy and the User Agreement in registration, you expressly consent to our use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and subject to the terms of the DocuSign Terms of Use Agreement. This Privacy Policy is effective upon acceptance in registration for new registering users, and is otherwise effective on November 24th, 2003 for all users. 

**1\. Information We Collect.**  
Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, secure online application which will assist you in sending and signing contracts. In order to do so, DocuSign must collect information to identify users, and to allow our users to identify each other. We only collect information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose.

In general, you can browse the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. Once you give us your personal information, you are not anonymous to us. If you choose to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout the Site. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional. You always have the option to not provide information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.  


Under some circumstances users may require some additional information in order to authenticate you such as, but not limited to: your name, your address, or the last 4 digits of your social security number. We may also use financial information, including credit card information to verify the accuracy of your name, address, and other information, as well as to bill you for your use of our services. Under no circumstances will any of this information be used to generate a credit scoring report that will show up against your credit.

We automatically track certain information to increase security such as IP addresses, email addresses, and other information. 

We may use data collection devices such as "cookies" on certain pages of the Site to help analyze our web page flow, measure effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. "Cookies" are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing our services. We offer certain features that are only available through the use of a "cookie". We also use cookies to allow you to enter your password less frequently during a session. Cookies can also help us provide information that is targeted to your interests. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted from your hard drive at the end of a session. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on the Site and you may be required to reenter your password more frequently during a session.

Additionally, the DocuSign Web client or DocuSign Professional client is loaded on your computer if you wish to send documents for signature. These clients are also governed by this Privacy Policy.  


If you establish a credit account with us to pay the fees we charge, we collect some additional information, such as a billing address, a credit card number and a credit card expiration date and tracking information from checks or money orders.

If you use DocuSign to send documents we will encrypt and store these documents in an account and make the contents available only to those whom you invite to view or sign these files. DocuSign employees do not have access to this information, nor can they access your signature file or other data, but it is stored in our system.  


If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, we may collect such information into a file specific to you.

If you register for DocuSign on another web site or use a web site providing a service for DocuSign or a web site that helps facilitate your activity on DocuSign, that web site may provide personal information about you and your transactions back to DocuSign.

**2\. Our Use of Your Information.**  
We use your personal information to facilitate the services you request. We use your personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site to: resolve disputes; troubleshoot problems; help promote safe exchange of documents for signature and delivery; collect fees owed; authenticate users, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, and updates; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our User Agreement; and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular we may examine your personal information to identify users using multiple User IDs or aliases. We may compare and review your personal information for errors, omissions and for accuracy.

If you choose to use our service and pay with credit card or corporate invoice, we use your address and billing information to bill you and provide associated support.

**3\. Our Disclosure of Your Information.**  
As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any of your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personal information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide our services.

Internal Service Providers for Our Operations. We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g., search technology, authentication systems, bill collection, and fraud detection) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers' are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced DocuSign related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses.

Legal Requests. **** DocuSign cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property rights, fraud and other rights, to help protect you and the DocuSign community from bad actors. Therefore, in response to a verified request by law enforcement or other government officials relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, city, state, telephone number, email address, UserID history, fraud complaints, usage history without a subpoena. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy and our ability to keep the community free from bad actors, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement or other government officials without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to: prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss; or report suspected illegal activity. Further, we can (and you authorize us to) disclose your name, street address, city, state, zip code, country, phone number, email, and company name to DocuSign Internal Service Providers under confidentiality agreement, as we in our sole discretion believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity.  


Due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private, but you should know that we will take all reasonable steps to provide you a highly secure environment.

**5\. Your Use of Other Users' Information.**  
In order to facilitate interaction among all DocuSign members, our Product may allow you limited access to other users' contact and authentication status information.

By entering into our User Agreement, you agree that, with respect to other users' information that you obtain through the Site or through a DocuSign- related communication or DocuSign-facilitated transaction, DocuSign hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: (a) DocuSign- related communications that are not unsolicited commercial messages, (b) using services offered through DocuSign (e.g. document sending, signing, notarizing, etc), and (c) any other purpose that a user expressly agrees to after you tell them the purpose you would like to use it for. In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to withdraw consent to sign electronically. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section, can you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without our consent and the consent of that user. You agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this Section.

**6\. Control of Your Password.**  
You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password, including fees charged to your account, and all actions taken with your account. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your DocuSign password to any third parties. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change your password.

**7\. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information.**  
We offer you the ability to automatically review and change the information you submit to us by logging into the Site and entering in the new information yourself. Generally, we will not modify your personal information based on your request because it is difficult to authenticate your account manually. You can change your password, contact information, financial information, and user preferences by going to the profile area. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Changing your personal information will not impact any completed transactions.

Upon your request, we will deactivate your account, contact information, billing information, shipping information, and financial information from our active databases. To make this request, email sales@DocuSign.com. Such information will be deactivated as soon as reasonably possible based on your account activity and in accordance with our deactivation policy and applicable law.

We will retain in our files some personal information, and past document transactions to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our User Agreement and comply with legal requirements as is permitted by law. Therefore, you should not expect that all of your personal information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your requests. However, such personal information will be deactivated from member viewing and will only be available to select DocuSign personal.

**8\. Other Information Collectors.**  
Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties using our system, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Since DocuSign does not control the privacy policies of third parties, or other individuals actions, you are subject to the privacy policies of that third party or individuals. We encourage you to be sure the recipients are authenticated to your satisfaction before you send them any documents.

**9\. Security.**  
Your information is stored on DocuSign Inc.'s servers located in the United States. We use procedural and technical safeguards to protect your personal information against loss or theft as well as unauthorized access and disclosure to protect your privacy, including encryption, "firewalls" and Secure Socket Layers. We treat data as an asset that must be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**10\. Notice.**  
We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the amended terms on the Site. All amended terms shall automatically be effective 30 days after they are initially posted on the Site. In addition, we will notify you in accordance with the law.
