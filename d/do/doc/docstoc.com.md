### **Cookies**

When you use or access the Docstoc Site we may use small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters called cookies to improve overall Site experience, among other things. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. Docstoc may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie generally disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Docstoc site or other web sites. Persistent cookies can generally be removed by you. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings and to remove cookies. We may also use web beacons on our site and in emails that we send to you. We may collect information regarding pages visited, searches performed, documents and profiles viewed, documents downloaded, documents uploaded, reviews, and comments made.

**Automatically Collected Information:  **When you access the Site or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using different types of tracking technology, including server logs. This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique device or user ID, version of software installed, system type, browser used, the content and pages that you access on the Site, the dates and times that you visit the Site, documents that you viewed, uploaded, or downloaded, and advertisements that you clicked on, and information from your Facebook account that you make publicly available, which is provided to us by Facebook via the Facebook APIs. Like most Web sites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These "server logs" typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

### **Aggregate Information**

The Site may track the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, browser type, and IP addresses, and we may analyze this data for trends and statistics in the aggregate, but such information will be maintained, used, and disclosed in aggregate form only and it will not contain personally identifiable information. We may use such aggregate information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

### **Disclosure**

We may provide your personally identifiable information and the data generated by cookies, web beacons, logs, and the aggregate information to the vendors and service agencies that we may engage to assist us in providing our Services and advertising to you. Such third party entities may be obligated to use your personally identifiable information to provide the services to us. We will disclose your personally identifiable information if we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law, regulation or in cooperation with any governmental investigation, including upon receipt of what we believe may be a valid subpoena, whether issued by a Court that has jurisdiction over Docstoc or not. (Please note that Docstoc reserves the right to assert that only the Federal District Court of the Central District of California, and the Los Angeles County Superior Court have jurisdiction, and subpoenas from outside those jurisdictions must be "domesticated," though we are not obligated to do so.) We will not sell your personally identifiable information to any company or organization, however, we may transfer your personally identifiable information to a successor entity upon a merger, consolidation, or other corporate reorganization in which Docstoc participates or to a purchaser of all or substantially all of Docstoc's assets to which this Site relates.

This may include the date you opened your account, the date you last logged into your account, your age (if you choose to make it public), and the number of documents you have uploaded, downloaded, and viewed.

Your Docstoc account name, not your email address, is displayed to other users when you engage in certain activities on Docstoc. Other users can contact you by leaving a message or comment on the Site.

Although we may attempt to contractually limit what third party advertising companies and networks do, we have no ability to monitor or control what they do. Recently some advertising companies and networks have been sued for allegedly using what are called local shared objects or re-spawning cookies (including by using Adobe® flash cookies). Although we attempt to contractually require that these companies shall always allow the end-user (you) to easily and completely uninstall any means of tracking the end-user without regenerating the means of such tracking, we cannot assure that this will occur and, therefore, you consent to these types of practices. If you would like more information about what many advertising companies and advertising networks do and to know some of your choices about not having this information used by the companies that are member of the Network Advertising Initiative, please visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>. We cannot assure that all of our third-party advertising companies and advertising networks are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, or that they comply with the policies of the Network Advertising Initiative.

We may employ procedural and technological security measures that are reasonably designed to help protect your personally identifiable information from loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Docstoc may use encryption, password protection, and other security measures to help prevent unauthorized access to your personally identifiable information. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING THE SECRECY OF YOUR UNIQUE PASSWORD AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT ALL TIMES. WE CANNOT, HOWEVER, ENSURE OR WARRANT THE SECURITY OF ANY INFORMATION YOU TRANSMIT TO US, AND YOU DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK. ONCE WE RECEIVE YOUR TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION, WE MAKE COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE EFFORTS TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF OUR SYSTEMS. HOWEVER, PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT A GUARANTEE THAT SUCH INFORMATION MAY NOT BE ACCESSED, DISCLOSED, ALTERED, OR DESTROYED BY BREACH OF ANY OF OUR PHYSICAL, TECHNICAL, OR MANAGERIAL SAFEGUARDS. IF WE LEARN OF A SECURITY SYSTEMS BREACH, THEN WE MAY ATTEMPT TO NOTIFY YOU ELECTRONICALLY SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE STEPS.

### **Notice to European Users**

The information you enter on this Site or otherwise provide to Docstoc may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, you are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy policy, you consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by Docstoc on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.
