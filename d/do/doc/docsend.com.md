# Details on how we safeguard your privacy.

Last Modified: March 18, 2015 (“ **Effective Date** “)

This privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** “) is designed to inform you about DocSend, Inc.’s (“ **DocSend** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** “) policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information in connection with your use of the DocSend™ service. DocSend provides a web-based and mobile service designed to assist its users with sharing their information, content, materials, files and folders (together, their “ **Stuff** “) and analyzing how their Stuff is viewed and/or received by their customers and others (the “ **Service** “). Users can access the Service through our website [https://docsend.com](https://docsend.com/), applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “ **Device** ” is any computer used to access the DocSend Service, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the DocSend Service, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

The Service is made available to users who have DocSend accounts (“ **Users** “) via the web site located at https://docsend.com (the “ **Site** “). DocSend Users use the Service to communicate with their customers, prospective customers, and other third parties that are not registered Users of the Service (“ **Viewers** “).

The procedures for modifying or changing this Privacy Policy in the future are discussed in Section 13 of this document.

### 1\. The Information We Collect And Store

We may collect and store both Non-Personally-Identifying information and Personally-Identifying Information from you. “ **Non-Personally-Identifying Information** ” is information that, without the aid of additional information, cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. “ **Personally-Identifying Information** ” or “ **PII** ” by contrast, is information such as a name or email address that, without more, can be directly associated with a specific person or entity.

If you are located in a country in the European Union or elsewhere outside the United States of America, by using the Service, you specifically consent to the transmission and storage of your PII and Stuff into the United States of America.

####  _A. Our Collection and Storage of Personally-Identifying Information_  


Information You Provide as a User.

When you as a User register an account, you may be asked to disclose Personally-Identifying Information including without limitation, your name, phone number, email address, home address or business address. You may also choose to submit Personally-Identifying Information to us when you send us an email or use any interactive features that we may make available on the Service. For example, you may ask us to: (a) import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (such as your email account) or (b) use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. You may also provide us with your contacts’ email addresses when sharing folders or files with them or if you invite them to join DocSend, or choose to reveal Personally-Identifying Information in on-line for a, blogs, message boards, chatrooms that we may make available via the Service. In addition, if you sign up for our paid Service, you will be asked to provide additional information, including your credit card information, as described below in Section 8.

If you are a User, we may automatically collect information about your account and your interaction with and use of the Service. We collect this information in order to deliver the Service and to provide you with reporting and analytics relating to your use of the Service.

This information may include:

  * Date and time you uploaded Stuff to our Service;
  * Whether or not Stuff was modified by you;
  * Number of times and length of time Stuff was presented by you using the Service;
  * Your phone number (if utilizing conference calling features); and
  * Your IP address and location.



This information is made available to Users via the Service and may be associated with other information about the User and its Viewers (including PII) that Users provide us.

Information We Receive from Viewers.

If you are a Viewer, a User may request that you provide them with information (including PII) via the Services in order to view that User’s Stuff. DocSend stores this information on behalf of our Users. In the event you as a Viewer provide a User with this information, you do so in accordance with that User’s privacy practices and policies. DocSend is not responsible for the privacy practices of its Users, and does not access this information except with a User’s permission, in order to provide the Services and related support and assistance. If you are a Viewer of one of DocSend’s Users and would no longer like to be contacted by such User that uses DocSend’s Service, please contact the User that you interact with directly.

Information We Receive from Third Parties.

We may also receive PII (such as your email address) through other Users, for example if they have tried to share something with you or tried to refer DocSend to you.

Files.

We collect and store Personally Identifiable Information included in the files you upload, download, or access with the Service (“ **Files** “). If you add a file to your account that has been previously uploaded by you or another user, we may associate all or a portion of the previous file with your account rather than storing a duplicate.

####  _A. General_  


Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this Privacy Policy with respect to Personally-Identifying Information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Service. Thus, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information you provide to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of a link on this Service or otherwise, and before providing any Personally-Identifying Information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party responsible for that site, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.

####  _B. Third Party Collection of Your Credit Card Information_  


If you choose to subscribe to a Purchased Service, our third party credit card processor ([Stripe](https://www.stripe.com/)) will process your credit card. Accordingly, you authorize DocSend to collect, use, retain and disclose your credit card and other payment information to Stripe and represent and warrant that you have all necessary rights to disclose such information to us. In addition, we may share your PII with trusted third parties who are integral to the operation of our Service, including but not limited to financial institutions, payment processors, verification services and credit bureaus, as well as any third parties that you have directly authorized to receive your PII. If you have questions about how Stripe protects the data it receives from DocSend Users, please refer to <https://stripe.com/us/terms> and <https://stripe.com/us/privacy>.

DocSend does not receive or store credit card information on our servers. We receive a transaction “token” and a one-time use ID number so we can validate that the transaction has been successfully completed. Areas of this Service that collect your Personally-Identifying Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption; however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection.

### 9\. Security

The security of your information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personally-Identifying Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our website, you can contact us at [security@docsend.com](mailto:security@docsend.com).

### 13\. Changes to our Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a material change to this privacy policy, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email if you have provided your email address to us and your email address is current).
