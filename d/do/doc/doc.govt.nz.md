# Privacy and security

The Department of Conservation is committed to protecting the privacy and security of visitors to the Department of Conservation website.

You may browse and access information contained within this website without providing any personal information. 

Where you voluntarily provide personal information (e.g. through email feedback), we will only use that information to communicate with you. We will keep any such information secure and will not disclose it to any third parties. 

## Online booking

Our online booking system uses an in-memory cookie, which is set to last no longer than 30 minutes. The cookie itself doesn't collect any personal information about you (it is used to hold basic authentication-related information) and the content is encrypted.

Information you provide as part of the booking process is retained on a secure site so we can contact you regarding your booking and maintain and manage your booking. 

If you have indicated acceptance in completing surveys or evaluations on your booking, you may be contacted within the next 18 months.

Your information will not be passed onto third parties unless:

  1. it relates to services booked by you on the DOC website but supplied by a third party and the third party requires those details.
  2. it is required by Police or Search and Rescue to carry out searches, rescues or in Civil Defence emergencies.
