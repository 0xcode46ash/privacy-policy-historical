Any capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning ascribed in the [_Terms of Use Agreement_](http://www.sundancenow.com/termsofuse.htm).

This Privacy Policy will remain in full force and effect, even if your use of or participation in the Site or any particular service, feature, function or promotional activity offered on or in connection with the Site terminates, expires, ceases, is suspended or deactivated for any reason. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not participate in the Site or any features, activities or services offered on or in connection with the Site which require your personal information.  ****

This Privacy Policy applies regardless of the Device you use to access the Site and whether you are accessing the Site as a registered user (i.e., an end user with a User Account) or otherwise.  This Privacy Policy governs only the Information (as defined herein) collected by us on or in connection with the Site and does not cover any other information collected in any other manner or collected by any other entity, unless specifically stated. Where you have provided your personal information to third parties such as affiliated companies, marketing companies or Advertisers and have provided sufficient consent, we may obtain such personal information and combine it with your Information and, if we do so, our use of the resulting combined Information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.

You may choose to provide certain information to us when you use the Site. When we use the term " _Personal Information_ " we mean any information that we collect on or in connection with the Site that would allow someone to identify you or contact you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, payment card information or telephone number. When we use the term " _Additional Information_ ", we mean any information that we collect on the Site other than Personal Information. (Personal Information and Additional Information shall be collectively referred to as " _Information_ "). By visiting, accessing or otherwise using the Site, you affirmatively consent to our collection and use of Information in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**1.          INFORMATION WE COLLECT **

A.         **User Registration.** If you elect to become a registered user of the Site, we will require you to provide as part of your User Account certain Information, which may include, but not be limited to, your email address, legal name, etc., and, in order to conduct fee-based transactions, your physical address, telephone number(s), applicable payment data (e.g., credit card number and expiration date), etc. and your date of birth, country of residence, zip code, etc. 

B.         **Site Features, Functions and Communications**. The Site may provide you with access to certain features or functions, such as interactive and community features, message boards, ratings and profile pages which may be subject to Additional Terms including notices and settings which will determine who can see such information which you should read before adding your Information to the feature and using it. To participate in these features and functions, you may be asked to provide certain Information about you in order to personalize and/or allow you to use these features and functions. For example, in order to personalize your user profile on the Site, you may have the option to provide certain additional information, including, but not limited to, your city, state and country, a short description of yourself, a profile image, or other information and content. At times, you may be presented with the opportunity to sign up to receive newsletters, email communications, or other communications from us in order for us to provide up-to-date information about the Site, and to publicize and promote certain content, products and services offered by us or our business partners. When there is a separate sign-up for newsletters, we may ask for your contact information such as name and email address, and, sometimes, demographic and profile information.  We may ask you to confirm your consent to these uses at the time you sign up for these services or communications.

C.         **Promotions,** **Contests, and Sweepstakes.   **To participate in certain Promotions, including contests, sweepstakes and surveys, there may be a separate registration process which may require the submission of both Personal Information and Additional Information (including, but not limited to, your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, demographic or profile information, etc.). We will use the Information you provide for the purpose of conducting the promotion, including, without limitation, contacting you if you have won. You may also have the opportunity to opt-in to receive special Promotions or offers from our Advertisers as a result of your use of the Site and such activity may be governed in accordance with _Section 4_ herein.

D.         **Information Collected Through Automatic Data Collection.   **Our Site includes features that automatically collect your Internet protocol (IP) address and Additional Information regarding your visits to the Site to assist us in keeping track of your preferences, create a more tailored user experience and better serve your particular interests and needs. ****

The Site and/or third parties may use "cookies," (which are small data files containing information about you that is stored on your hard drive), "embedded scripts", and other similar tracking technologies (collectively, " _Tracking Technologies_ ") to collect Additional Information automatically as you interact with the Site. Some cookies are used to make login to our Site easier (such as by remembering your User Account).  Cookies also enable us to track your interaction with the Site and target your interests to enhance your Site experience. We may also use Tracking Technologies to collect "clickstream" data, such as the domain name of the service providing you with Internet access, the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our Site, pages viewed, content searched for, access times and other relevant statistics, and assign unique identifiers to the Device you use to access the Site for the same purposes. We may associate the information obtained through these Tracking Technologies with your Personal Information so we can better customize your Site experience and provide tailored advertisements and Promotions related to your specific interests.  By visiting the Site, whether as a registered user or otherwise, you acknowledge, understand and hereby agree that you are giving us your consent to track your activities and your use of the Site as described in this Privacy Policy. 

This Site may also use a variety of third party advertising networks, data exchanges, traffic measurement service providers, marketing analytics service providers and other third parties (collectively, " _Third Party Advertising Service Providers_ ") to, for example, serve advertisements on the Site, facilitate targeting of advertisements and/or measure and analyze advertising effectiveness and/or traffic on the Site. Such services may enable us to display advertisements based on your visits to the Site and other websites you have visited. Targeting services enable us to, among other things, help deliver advertisements or other content to you for products and services that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  For example, if you are using Internet Explorer, search for "Cookies" in the Help menu to find detailed instructions.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to use interactive features of this Site or other Web sites that depend on cookies.
