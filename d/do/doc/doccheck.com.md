# Privacy - DocCheck

DocCheck® places a high priority on data protection. DocCheck takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

 **What this privacy and cookie policy covers**

This privacy policy covers DocCheck’s treatment of personally identifiable information when you use DocCheck's services. This policy also covers DocCheck's treatment of any personally identifiable information that DocCheck’s business partners share with DocCheck.

 **Information collection and use**

DocCheck collects personally identifying information when you register for a DocCheck password, a DocCheck account and when you use certain DocCheck services, this only with the user’s explicit permission.  
When you register with DocCheck, we ask for your name, email address, birth date, gender, postal address (street, zip code, city, country), discipline and occupation. Once you register with DocCheck and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.  
DocCheck uses information for three general purposes: to produce anonymous statistics, based on the details given by you at registration and your activity at DocCheck, to fulfil your requests for certain products and services, and to contact you about specials, new services and for customer feedback.

 **Information sharing and disclosure**

DocCheck will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone without the explicit user’s permission.  
DocCheck may send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people (like for example the DocCheck Personal service) when:

 **Cookies**

DocCheck may set and access DocCheck cookies on your computer.  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computer and stored on your computer's hard drive.  
Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.  
 **  
Choices about cookies**

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)  
If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use DocCheck products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of all offerings. However, many DocCheck products and services do not require that you accept cookies.

 **DocCheck’s practices regarding cookies**

DocCheck uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:

 **Disabling/enabling cookies**

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. However, you may not be able to use all the interactive features of our site if cookies are disabled.  
Your ability to edit and delete your personal information and preferences  
DocCheck gives you the ability to edit your DocCheck user data and preferences at any time, including whether you want DocCheck to contact you about specials, new products and for customer feedback.  
The user can view data stored in DocCheck® at any time after entering his username and password on the DocCheck web site.

 **Confidentiality and security**

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.  
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

 **Changes to this privacy policy**

DocCheck may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
