DoItYourself.com Inc. is a leading provider of home improvement and repair information on the Internet. DoItYourself.com Inc.Â has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices.

  * ## Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

Our websites log IP addresses and browser types, but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that users sessions are tracked, but the users remain anonymous. You can browse our site without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. However, we hope that our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about our valuable visitors. Our registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and very limited demographic information. We encourage all visitors to register with us in our Community Forums.

We maintain a separate list of email addresses which are used to send our newsletters containing news about the subjects you and fellow readers have asked us about. If you would rather not receive the newsletter(s) you may opt out from any page on our website or in our forums as well as from links at the bottom of every newsletter.

Preferences and demographic information are used to help us improve our services. The more we know about our visitors, the better we can serve them.

  * ## Relationships and Surveys

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). Contact data from our surveys is used to send users information about our company. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. This information is shared with advertisers only on an aggregate basis.

The Company maintains special relationships, with various strategic partners, business partners, and operates several co-branded sites. For example Socratic Inc. maintains a paid by incentives panel known as "The DoItYourself.com Advisors" at [http://panel.doityourself.com](http://panel.doityourself.com/). Another example is Service Magic who matntains a contractor referall service. These and other co-branded sites may gather additional information; the Company sometimes has access to some or all of the information, and the Company's partner's use of the information is not within the Company's control.

  * ## Forums

Our Community Forums allow users to view over one million threads without registering. We require visitors to register before posting so we can track the quantity and quality of their questions and answers, and to recognize longer standing with member status instead of visitor or apprentice. We also have a number of volunteer forum moderators. The information posted therein is therefore not in our control. For those visitors who do register, they have the ability to post, edit their posts, and receive an email when their question is answered. These choices are optional, and are selected by each member individually. The same conditions apply to the ability to post article and product reviews.

  * ## Links and Linked Sites

Our website contains links which may including framing in of pages from other Web sites we have selected. We also maintain a database where visitors can post Community Links. Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to linked sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any Web site.

As is true with ANY Internet usage and access to ANY Website, if you are using someone else's computer, or someone else has access to your computer, or spy ware is resident on your computer, or you are using a corporate or other "network", it may be possible for that "someone else" or the "network" operator to retrieve copies of Email you sent from the computer and/or to trace the places you have been visiting on the Internet.
