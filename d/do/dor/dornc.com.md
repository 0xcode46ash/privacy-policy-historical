To protect your privacy, we will not send sensitive or confidential information to anyone in an e-mail unless the sensitive or confidential information is in an encrypted attachment. Also we will not use e-mail to request personal, tax or financial information.

Physical, electronic and procedural safeguards are in place to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to preserve data integrity, and to ensure the appropriate use of confidential information you provide on our website. We use industry-standard encryption technology when collecting or transferring confidential information. 

For general website security purposes and to ensure that our site remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Use of our site constitutes consent to such monitoring. Unauthorized attempts to upload information and/or change information on this website are strictly prohibited and are subject to legal action.
