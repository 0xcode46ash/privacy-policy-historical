You have a choice as to whether to provide DORMA with any Personally Identifiable Information.  Although you are not required to disclose any Personally Identifiable Information to us, portions of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website may not be available to you without your providing this information.

Due to the business-oriented nature of our business and the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website, the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website is not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.

In addition, DORMA may hire other companies to perform services on our behalf such as operating certain aspects of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website or sending you email.  These other companies may be supplied with or have access to your Personally Identifiable Information for the sole purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.   DORMA may also use third-party ad servers or ad networks to deliver ads to you on DORMA’s behalf.  These third-party ad servers may be supplied with or have access to your Personally Identifiable Information for the sole purpose of providing these services to us or on our behalf.  They also may also collect and use non-personally identifiable information about your visits to the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website in order to send advertisements that may be of interest to you.

Though we will make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose Personally Identifiable Information when required by law or if we have a good-faith belief that the action is necessary to comply with a pending judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on DORMA or to protect our rights or the rights of others, to fight fraud, identity theft, to ensure the integrity and operation of our business and systems, or to protect the rights, property or safety of DORMA, its employees, members or others.

##### How We Share Your Information

We will not disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to others without your permission, except as explained in this Privacy Policy.

##### Third Party Offers

In arranging to have marketing and promotional information of third party companies that we think might be of interest to you, we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to nonaffiliated third parties not controlled by DORMA.  If you do not want to us to disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third party companies, simply send us an email at privacy@dorma.com as described in the section below on Accessing and Updating Information.

##### Aggregate Information

On an aggregate basis only, we collect comprehensive demographic, business information and data, and other non-identifying information about users of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website.  DORMA will never disclose any Personally Identifiable Information as part of this aggregate information but we may lend, sell, share or otherwise disclose aggregate information with others so we can perform research and provide the results to third parties, enhance and market the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website, and conduct accounting and process record keeping functions.

##### Other websites and links

We may include links to other websites that we think will be of interest to you or operated by our business partners, affiliates, advertisers, and others. These third parties have separate data collection and privacy practices independent from ours, and DORMA cannot be responsible for their policies or activities. Please contact those third parties directly if you have questions about their privacy policies.

##### Cookies, Web Beacons, Clear Gifs, and IP Addresses

DORMA also uses a feature of your browser called a “cookie.”  Your cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website and allows us to correlate your computer with certain usage patterns which are stored in our log files.  We use cookies to gather general, aggregate statistics about the overall popularity and usage of www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website.  DORMA also uses more temporary cookies, often referred to as session cookies, to keep a user logged into the system and aid in the exchange of information between pages without loss of data.  Such a cookie, however, is only stored for the current browsing session and is deleted once the browser is closed. DORMA can also only read cookies from the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website.  Search for Cookies under your Web browser's Help menu for more information on cookie management features available to you.  If your browser is set to reject all cookies, the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website may not function properly.

DORMA may also collect information through the use of clear gifs (also called Web Beacons and Web Bugs) in selected email messages we send to you. These are tiny graphic files, not visible to the human eye, that are included in HTML-based emails and used to let us know which emails we send are opened.  Clear gifs may also see or read cookies on your computer.  When authorized by DORMA, third parties specializing in monitoring aggregate statistical use of our site with whom we contract, may use cookies, our web log files, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous aggregate data.

Additionally, we may use IP address information to count and track aggregate visits to www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website.  DORMA does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable so while a particular user’s session can be tracked, the user remains completely anonymous.

##### Accessing and Updating Information

DORMA does not currently have an online method for users to delete their Personally Identifiable Information contained in our database. However, you may change or update the Personally Identifiable Information we have collected, request that we delete it, or request that we change how we use it by sending an email to privacy@dorma-usa.com with your instructions.

##### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We encourage you to review our Privacy Policy not just the first time you visit the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website but periodically afterwards since we may modify our Privacy Policy from time to time.  The date of the last update of the Privacy Policy will always be posted below:

THIS PRIVACY POLICY WAS LAST REVISED ON APRIL 1, 2005.

If we make any substantive changes to our Privacy Policy in the future with regard to how we use your Personally Identifiable Information, we will incorporate those changes here.  Your continued use of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website after the changes are posted constitutes your agreement to the changes, both with regard to information we have previously collected from you and with regard to information we collect from you in the future. If you do not agree to the changes, please discontinue use of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website.  Lastly, if DORMA is sold or merged with another company, your Personally Identifiable Information will be included as part of the sale but unless you’re notified that the Privacy Policy is changed, your Personally Identifiable Information will be maintained in the same manner.

##### International Users

Like almost every website, the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website is accessible around the world.  By visiting the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website and providing your information, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information can be stored for the purposes identified in this Privacy Policy.  We process and store your information in North America and your information may be stored on servers located outside your residential jurisdiction and which may have less stringent privacy practices than your own.  If you access the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website from outside the United States, your usage of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website constitutes consent to the transfer of your data outside of your country and to North America.

##### Security

This Website has industry-standard security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control, and we make good faith efforts to store your personal information in a secure operating environment. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.  If DORMA provides you with a user name and password to access other portions of the www.dorma-usa.com | www.dorma.com/us/ Website, DORMA disclaims any responsibility for a breach of privacy as a result of your willingly or inadvertently disclosing your user name and password to others.
