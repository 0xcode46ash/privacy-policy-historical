# Privacy - DoubleVerify

DoubleVerify uses various technologies, described below, to collect information about online advertising and website traffic in order to deliver the following advertising transparency and accountability services to our advertising customers (collectively, “DoubleVerify Services”): 

\- Data reporting about the context in which advertisements are displayed and information about whether an ad being displayed is in compliance with: (1) the customer’s contractual terms; (2) the insertion order governing our customer’s campaign; and/or (3) profile settings our customer has established in our system. 

\- Preemptive decisioning of impression opportunities, meaning that DoubleVerify technology analyzes the available data characteristics of an impression opportunity and determines - using customer-established profile setting -- whether the customer’s advertisement should be displayed or not. 

\- Delivery information about the viewability of online display advertising, including: (1) whether an advertisement meets certain criteria, set by industry standards boards and/or the client to be counted as a “Viewed Impression;” (2) how long the advertisement was displayed in the consumer’s browser; and (3) other key information about the display characteristics of the creative on the consumer’s browser. 

\- We may work (with our partners) to anonymously integrate advertising impression data with data that our partners independently collect to deliver enhanced ad-measurement services such as augmented and aggregated audience demographic reporting of campaign impressions viewed or brand lift metrics. 

\- Website visitation characteristics including visitor quality, fraud identification and other quality characteristics necessary to determine agreement compliance.  






DoubleVerify Services may use pixels and other similar technologies that can place a small piece of HTML code on a webpage to collect information about advertising impression opportunities and displayed ads or website traffic. The types of data we collect using this technology include: 

\- Standard HTTP header information including information such as IP address, Referring URL, User-Agent data (e.g., data that your browser transmits about itself when submitting an HTTP request) and other data including browser configuration parameters such as browser language and session storage and local storage settings, and characteristics of your device such as the CPU class and time zone setting. 

\- Information contained within an advertisement, known as an “Ad Tag,” that includes information used to identify the advertiser displaying the ad and the media property that sold the impression. 

\- Browser and computer environmental information necessary to determine the viewability of an advertisement, which includes information such as ad size, ad location in the browser viewport, size of the browser viewport, size of the display, application in focus, browser tab in focus, and other data. 





DoubleVerify Services include the detection and elimination of Ad Impression Fraud, which is defined for purposes of this policy as the manipulation of ad serving, ad display or traffic activity such that ad impression measurements are incremented inappropriately because the ads cannot be viewed by a user, are not served within operationally viewable parameters or were displayed as a result of machine-generated traffic. Our fraud services are not intended to address fraud as defined by law or as conventionally used in legal proceedings in the United States, but rather to address “fraud” as defined herein strictly for advertising measurement purposes. DoubleVerify Services also include determining if advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements. 

For the purpose of identifying and preventing online Ad Impression Fraud and determining if advertisers and their partners are in compliance with their agreements, DoubleVerify Services utilize information collected in conjunction with the following additional technologies: 

\- Cookies that may be set by third party service providers executing a DoubleVerify pixel so that DoubleVerify can recognize the device. 

\- Device identification technology, which analyzes device parameters collected as described above, including IP address and browser header information, to probabilistically identify a particular device. 

\- Clickstream data including URLs and other data regarding the websites on which a particular browser has viewed advertising impressions we are analyzing. 





This information is used to identify and prevent Ad Impression Fraud and to assess contract compliance by: 

\- Identifying specific ad impressions that are fraudulent due to being generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers. 

\- Identifying websites and media properties that have fraudulent traffic and/or generate fraudulent advertising impressions. 

\- Identifying traffic patterns between websites participating in fraudulent advertising activity. 

\- Distinguishing between traffic generated by bot-controlled, non-human browsers and human browsers. 

\- Determining if website visitors are being delivered by partners in compliance with contractual terms.
