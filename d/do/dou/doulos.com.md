If you do not wish to be tracked by our site, you may opt out [here](https://pk.doulos.com/N7QZzUVa/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut). Our software also respects the 'Do not Track' headers that most modern browsers provide, and will not track you if these are set. You can also stop tracking by disabling Javascript (although some areas of the site will be degraded in this case).

#### Cookies

Cookies are used for your convenience when downloading content from the website. Your country and email address are stored in the cookie so that you do not need to enter this information more than once. You do not need to keep the cookie permanently, however it will need to be present, at least temporarily, to allow the download.

Cookies are also required to make a purchase from the webshop, however these only last for the duration of your visit.

#### Form data

You will be asked for contact information if you subscribe for a webinar or email newsletter, enquire about any of our courses, or download some of the free resources from our website.

#### How do we use your personal data?

Where appropriate, we use your personal data:

#### Opt-Out Policy

You may chose to unsubscribe from any of our email notification services at any time. Before you opt-out, keep in mind that Doulos strives to minimize the number of notices emailed to approximately 5 per month (and these include course schedule announcements and webinar invitations). You may miss out on important invitations if you choose to opt-out from all Doulos mailings.
