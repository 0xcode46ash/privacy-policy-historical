# Doulos Privacy Policy

#### What personal data do we collect?

  


#### Tracking

The Doulos website collects tracking information which allows us to see how people are using the site and make improvements. All tracking information is stored by Doulos and is not collected by, or released to, third parties.

If you do not wish to be tracked by our site, you may opt out [here](https://web.archive.org/N7QZzUVa/index.php?module=CoreAdminHome&action=optOut). Our software also respects the 'Do not Track' headers that Firefox4 and IE9 provide, and will not track you if these are set. You can also stop tracking by disabling Javascript (although some areas of the site will be degraded in this case).

#### Cookies

Cookies are used for your convenience when downloading content from the website. Your country and email address are stored in the cookie so that you do not need to enter this information more than once. You do not need to keep the cookie permanently, however it will need to be present, at least temporarily, to allow the download.

Cookies are also required to make a purchase from the webshop, however these only last for the duration of your visit.

#### Form data

You will be asked for contact information if you subscribe for a webinar or email newsletter, enquire about any of our courses, or download some of the free resources from our website. 

Your details are stored securely and are only used in appropriate communications as detailed below. 

#### How do we use your personal data?

Where appropriate, we use your personal data: 

  * to provide you with information about our relevant training services
  * for basic profiling purposes;
  * to let you know about other services in which you may be interested;
  * to inform you about changes and improvements to this website.



  
We will only use this data to send you further information on our products and services in accordance with your indicated marketing preferences. We may contact you by post, email or telephone for these purposes. 

#### Opt-Out Policy

You may chose to unsubscribe from any of our email notification services at any time. Before you opt-out, keep in mind that Doulos strives to minimize the number of notices emailed to approximately 3 per month (and these include course schedule announcements and webinar invitations). You may miss out on important invitations if you choose to opt-out from all Doulos mailings. 

Please **[contact your local team](http://www.doulos.com/contact)** if you would prefer to limit the emails you receive in some way rather than opt-out.
