DBRS is committed to protecting the privacy of its employees and clients and we recognize the need to respect and protect personal information that is disclosed to us. Personal information includes any factual or subjective information about an identifiable individual but does not include the name, title, business address, or telephone number of an employee of an organization.

The Site collects data provided by your account administrator, as well as data provided automatically through the use of "cookie" technology. Examples of the type of information that may be collected automatically is registration information (e.g. user name and password), user preference data (e.g. a preference to track a particular industry), and page hit counts.

The information gathered is used to enhance your visit to the Site and tailor the DBRS services to suit your needs. DBRS uses personal information to administer subscriptions; to send you e-mail alerts based on your chosen industries or companies; to customize page content; to allocate resources to provide research on popular topics; and to keep you informed of research materials and conferences that may be of interest.

DBRS does not sell or share any personal information you provide through www.dbrs.com, or any other means. The information collected is used solely for internal purposes, some of which are mentioned above.

You may view/edit your user preferences at any time by going to My Settings on the Site.
