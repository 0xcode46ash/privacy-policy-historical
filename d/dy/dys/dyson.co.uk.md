# Privacy Policy

#### March 2016

### Introduction

At Dyson we are committed to ensuring that your personal information is protected and never misused.

Our privacy policy explains what personal information we collect, why we collect it, how we use it, the controls you have over your personal information and the procedures that we have in place to protect your privacy. It applies to personal information we collect through our Dyson websites, through Dyson apps (including Dyson Link) and through our connected products (explained in more detail below). 

By sharing your personal information with us, and by continuing to use our websites, apps and connected products, you confirm that you have read and understood the terms of this privacy policy. We take responsibility for the personal information we collect about you, and we aim to be transparent about how we handle it, and give you control over it.

In this privacy policy, when we refer to "Dyson", "us", "we" or "our", we mean the Dyson group company or companies which provide you with the Dyson websites, apps or connected products. In this policy, we refer to all Dyson group companies as the "Dyson Group". Information on which Dyson group company or companies are responsible for any personal information collected about you, is available on our Privacy Portal by clicking on the tab for your country ([http://www.dyson.co.uk/changecountry.aspx](http://www.dyson.cn/changecountry.aspx)[](http://www.dyson.co.uk/change-country.aspx)). 

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about any aspect of this policy or how Dyson handles your information please email our Privacy Team at [privacy@dyson.com](mailto:privacy@dyson.com).

##  Privacy Principles 

Privacy policies can be complicated. We have tried to make ours as clear and as accessible as possible. To help, we have also summarised how we handle your personal information at Dyson in our privacy principles below. These principles demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and handling your personal information in the right way and as you would expect it to be handled. 

At Dyson we:

  1. Only ask for or collect the personal information we need, to provide and improve the service, products and experiences our customers expect, and for other purposes outlined in our privacy policy.
  2. Give you control over the personal information we hold about you to ensure it is accurate and reflects your preferences.
  3. Make sure your personal information is always secure and protected
  4. Are fair and transparent about how we use the personal information we hold.
  5. Only use your personal information for the purpose that you trusted us to use it for, as outlined in our privacy policy.
  6. We never sell your information and only share it as outlined in our privacy policy or when you ask us to.
  7. Respect your choices and will inform you if there are changes that affect your personal information or how we use it. 
  8. Take responsibility for the personal information that we hold about you.



##  What personal information do we collect? 

We are not interested in collecting every personal detail about you. Our main reason for collecting your personal information is to provide and improve the service, products and experiences that you and our customers expect from us. 

Personal information is defined slightly differently across the world. To guarantee your privacy and the protection of your information, we define it as any information that could be used to identify you or another individual. 

We collect personal information from you in a number of different ways; you may share that information with us, or we may collect it using other means. In this section, we explain the different ways we collect personal information from you and some ways in which that information will be used. For more detail on how we use your personal information, please see the section titled "How do we use your personal information?".

### Information you share with us

We collect personal information that you share with us when you contact us or interact with us through our website, apps, email, phone or otherwise. You can decide not to provide certain information, or ask that any information you have previously shared is removed. If you do so, you may not be able to take full advantage of our products, technology and service. 

For example, you may provide information to us when you contact our customer service teams, place an order, register your warranty, complete a survey, competition or questionnaire, update your preferences and account information, connect through a Dyson app or rate one of our products on our website.

Through these interactions you may share with us: your name, address, e-mail address, contact number and payment information. You may also share details of other people; for example, if you have bought a Dyson product for that other person or if you register another person for a Dyson app. In those circumstances, you will need to check with that person that they are happy for you to share their personal information with us, and for us to use it in accordance with this privacy policy. 

### Information from Dyson products and apps

As well as the personal information you share with us about yourself and your Dyson product, we may collect and handle personal information directly from your Dyson connected products and Dyson apps. A connected product is a Dyson product that is “smart”, internet enabled or operated through a Dyson app. 

We may collect information about your use of our connected products or apps, to help us optimise their performance and your experience of using them. We may also collect internet protocol (IP) and/or media access control (MAC) identifier information about your mobile device.

Some of the information we collect from your use of our connected products and apps may enable us to determine the location of your connected product. This data is collected so that we can understand the location and environmental conditions in which your connected product is operating; for example, by giving an indication of the environment in which it operates, which helps us to optimise the performance of the connected product. 

Some of our connected products may not be able to operate without collecting location information, or other personal information, and so by registering for the app and using a connected product you agree to this use of the information. 

### Information from your online interactions

We collect and store limited personal information and anonymous, aggregate statistics from all visitors to our websites, whether you actively provide us with that information or merely browse our websites. The information we collect includes the internet protocol (IP) address of the device you are using, the browser software you use, your operating system, the date and time of access, the internet address of the website from which you link through to our website and information on how you use our websites.

We use this information so that we can see how long our websites take to load, how they are used, the number of visitors to the different sections of our websites, and what information visitors look at most. It also helps identify any part of our website that isn’t working as well as it should - so we can fix things and make our website better for you and other users.

We do not link information collected from your online interactions with any records we may have of you as a customer of Dyson.

### Cookies

When you use our websites we may also use information collected by cookies. "Cookies" are small text files that websites save onto your device via your web browser. They’ve been around since the mid-1990’s and are one of the most widely used technologies on the internet.

Some cookies that we use at Dyson will collect personal information about you. Any personal information that is collected will be used in accordance with this privacy policy. By continuing to use our websites, you accept that cookies may be set on your device. 

For further information, including on the types of cookies that we use and how to manage cookies placed on our websites, please refer to our [cookies policy](http://www.dyson.co.uk/support/cookies.aspx). Please note that we do not currently respond to Do Not Track (DNT) signals. 

### Email Communications

As long as you are happy for us to do so, we would like to keep you posted on anything that's happening at Dyson which we think you might like to know about; whether it’s our latest product announcements, owner offers or upcoming events, we want to make sure you’re happy with the communications you receive from us. You can find out how to update or change whether you would like to hear from us, or stop us contacting you, in the section below titled ‘How can you change the way that we contact you?' 

Sometimes we receive notifications when you open an e-mail from us; we use these statistics to help our teams to make our e-mails as interesting as possible by providing you with interesting content and experiences. 

### Social Media

We love interacting with you on social media. You may use social media to contact us about your Dyson products, or to let people know what you think about your Dyson product. We review publically available social media and online sites to get a better understanding of what people are saying about us, and our products, technology and services and to assist consumers who prefer to contact us through social media.

The information we collect from social media and online sites sometimes includes personal information that has been put online and is publically available. We make sure any information we use is properly credited to its source or is made anonymous. 

These online and social media sites may have their own privacy policies explaining how they use and share your personal information. You should carefully review those privacy policies before you use these sites to make sure that you are happy with how your personal information is being collected and shared.

We are committed to protecting your personal information.  We use appropriate technical and organisational measures, including encryption, to protect your personal information and privacy, and review those regularly.  We protect your personal information using a combination of physical and IT security controls, including access controls that restrict and manage the way in which your personal information and data is processed, managed and handled.  We also ensure that our staff are adequately trained in protecting your personal information.  Our procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we share your personal information with you. 

In the unlikely event that we do suffer a security breach which compromises our protection of your personal information and we need to let you know about it, we will do so.

##  Data transfers, storage and the global handling of your personal information 

Dyson is headquartered in the United Kingdom (UK). 

We collect personal information in the country in which you live. We then host and store that information in the European Economic Area (EEA). Those third parties that we share your personal information with may handle or transfer your personal information outside of the UK, and outside of the EEA, to other countries in which they have facilities.

We will make sure that both any transfer of your personal information by us or by the third parties that we share your personal information with, and our handling of your personal information, complies with those laws which apply to us.  In any case, our transfer, storage and handling of your personal information will continue to be governed by this privacy policy. 

By submitting your personal information to us, and by using our websites, apps or connected products, you agree to us transferring, storing and handling your personal information in this way.
