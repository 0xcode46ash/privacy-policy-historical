**Use of Cookies**  
Our website does not use cookies to collect your personal information. Cookies are only used to complete orders on our site. A 'cookie' is a small file which contains a piece of text identifying your browser to our site. It is quite common for online shopping sites to send such a 'cookie', and its purpose is to tell us that a previous visitor to www.dymocks.com.au has returned. 

**How we use the information**  
The information that you provide to us is generally used to provide goods or services to you. Dymocks may also use your personal information in other ways to provide you with better service such as by advising you of new products and services or information which may be of interest to you. You have the right to tell us that you do not want us to send information to you other than for the main purpose for which we have collected your personal information. 

Dymocks does not generally disclose personal information to third parties. In some circumstances personal information may be disclosed to parties who perform services on behalf of Dymocks for the purpose of providing you with goods and services (e.g. carriers). Third parties who receive your personal information are required to comply with the Privacy Act. 

We do not sell or rent any customer lists. 

**Storage of Information**  
Dymocks takes measures to ensure your personal information is protected from unauthorised access, loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration. We also take measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when it is no longer required. The types of measures we take vary with the type of information, and how it is collected and stored.
