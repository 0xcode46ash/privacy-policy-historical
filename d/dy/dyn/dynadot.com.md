What information is collected?

When opening an account, the Service collects your name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, and fax number. We collect this information because it may be necessary to contact you about your account. Also, if you are registering a domain name, this information is required by ICANN.

In addition, when you open an account, the Service asks you to create a username and password. The Service uses your username for identification purposes only, and uses your password for verification of your identity only.

  * If you are placing an order, the Service collects your credit card number and/or other billing information. This information is used only to collect payment for services rendered. If you are placing an order or logging in to your customer account, the Service may log your IP address as a security measure. If you purchase digital (SSL) certificate services, the Service also collects information about your subject domain name registration.

  * If you choose to participate in our Refer-A-Friend program or other promotions to tell others about our website, we will ask you to provide your friend's name and email address. The Service stores this information for the sole purpose of sending a one-time email to your friend.
