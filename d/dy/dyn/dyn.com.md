It is the policy of Dynamic Network Services, Inc. ("Dyn") to protect and respect the privacy and personal information of those that use its services. Therefore, Dyn will not monitor, edit, or disclose the contents of your private communications or data to third parties unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

1\. Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal processes served on Dyn;

2\. Identify, contact or bring legal action to defend and protect the rights or property of Dyn, its customer or end users, or anyone else;

3\. Act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its end users, customers, or the public;

4\. Administer its networks or systems to maintain performance for its end users or customers;

5\. Provide authenticated domain owners (registrant, administrative, or technical contacts) with contact information for the account which controls DNS for their domain.

Dyn will not give out your personal information to advertisers, business partners, sponsors, or other third parties in any form other than aggregate usage data. However, the preceding shall not prevent Dyn from sharing website usage data with third parties in efforts to improve its website.

Any financial data collected from you shall be stored in encrypted form, and will be made available for future transactions immediately upon request, and stored only for as long as required by applicable financial regulations.

You may contact Dyn at [hello@dyn.com](mailto:hello@dyn.com) to correct, update or remove personal information you have given us.

While Dyn strives to protect your personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and, as such, your disclosure of such information at your own risk.

Dyn's policies do not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Dyn's control. This policy will not be applied in any manner that is contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
