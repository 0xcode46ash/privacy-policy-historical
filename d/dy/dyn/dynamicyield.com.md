We may also use cookies to track and monitor usage of the Offering by End Users for the marketing and quality improvement purposes. Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer/device hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored.

We may use JavaScript tags to trigger a sequence of events that includes viewing a first-party cookie (or setting that cookie if it does not already exist) and to help us tailor and optimize our DY Offering for both our End Users and enterprise clients.

In addition to the foregoing, DY reserves the right to use the Google AdWords Remarketing Service (the “ **Google Service** ”) for advertising purposes.

 **How We/Enterprise Clients Use Information**

  1.  _For Internet-based Advertising and Improvement of our End-Users Experience_

We use the Personal Information and the Other Information (collectively, the “ _Information_ ”) for purposes of analyzing trends, administering our Offering, improving our services, and to gather demographic information about our End User base as a whole. We also compile and store data and information and generate reports related to our End Users’ access to and use of our Offering. To the extent required under applicable data processing laws and regulations, any PII that we collect will be stored in our database and will be used in accordance with such applicable laws and regulations.

There are also times when we will combine such information with additional non-personal or de-identified information we obtain from other companies as well as PII, in order for our enterprise clients to market directly to a certain person subject to requirements of applicable law. We typically analyze this information and organize it into user groups and audiences, based on factors such as age, gender, geography, interests and online actions. We and our enterprise clients then use these user groups and audiences, along with information about the possible relationships among different browsers and devices, to design and deliver customized advertising campaigns or other relevant content. This is often referred to as Interest-Based Advertising. To enable the foregoing, the DY Solutions use technology including browser cookies, device identifiers, and other similar technologies to recognize a particular browser or device over time, to predict possible relationships among different browsers and devices and to then relay this information to our servers.

DY retains the End User data described above which is collected through our DY Solutions for purposes of Interest-Based Advertising for up to twenty-four (24) months from the date of its collection.

  2.  _Email Communications_

We do not send emails to anyone without permission (which permission may have been given to us and/or one of our enterprise clients), and we do not sell or rent email addresses to any unauthorized third party. This does not mean that we can prevent spam from happening on the Internet. If you believe that you have received an unsolicited email from us, please contact us at the e-mail below and we will investigate.

At any time, you have the ability to opt out of receiving marketing communications from DY, but you may not opt out of administrative emails. You can opt out either changing your e-mail preferences or using the link provided at the bottom of each email message or through any other means that is made available to you

  * If you have opted out of our ability to use your e-mail address, we may share your decision to opt out with third parties to effectuate that decision;
  * If the information is required by law in order to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities. In addition, we will share information in response to legal process, court orders, subpoenas, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;
  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the Information: (i) when required by a federal or state regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such Information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the rights, property, or safety of DY or others.
