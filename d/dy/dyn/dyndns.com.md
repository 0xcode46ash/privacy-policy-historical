  5. Provide authenticated domain owners (registrant, administrative, or technical contacts) with contact information for the account which controls DNS for their domain.



DynDNS will not give out personal information of its Members to advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties in any form other than aggregate usage data. We do use a third party web analytics system.

Any financial data collected shall be stored in encrypted form, and will be made available for future transactions immediately upon request, and stored only for as long as required by applicable financial regulations.

The privacy of all Registrant, Administrative, Technical, and Billing contact information collected during domain registration/transfer is governed by the [Domain Registration Agreement](https://web.archive.org/about/legal/reg-agreement.html) \- please see that agreement for more details.

DynDNS' policies do not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond DynDNS' control, and are not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.
