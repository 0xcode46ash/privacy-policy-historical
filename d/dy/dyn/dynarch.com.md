Your email address shall stay private. We will _not_ share it, publish it, sell it nor display it anywhere.

  3. **Real name and/or Company name** — it is required to fill this information if you buy software products from Dynarch.com. This information is used in order to generate a software license contract and may be displayed in source code coments and license file.

## About credit card payments

If you buy products of Dynarch.com online, you will need to use a credit card. However, we do **not** get any information about your credit card. Credit card processing is assured by well known third party companies (currently [2CheckOut.com](http://2checkout.com/ "2CheckOut.com \(opens new window\)")).

### What we get from 2CheckOut

We do get from 2CheckOut information about your shipping address (not normally used as we only deliver electronic goods), email address used when buying (also not normally used as we will use the email address that you registered with us) and an encrypted transaction key that we are using in order to generate license keys. Also the transaction key tells us if the payment was cleanly processed.

It is impossible to determine any kind of information from the transaction key (it's a one-way, “MD5” encryption). In order to check the transaction validity, we only generate a similar key starting from data that we already know (such as price, our 2CheckOut seller ID, etc.) and compare the encrypted keys.

Aside for the transaction key which is likely to be included in product source code comments and license, as the license key for the goods that you buy, we will not share any other information passed to us by 2CheckOut.com, unless it's otherwise required by the law.

## Exceptional cases

We will never use the information that we collect in ways other than specified in this document, unless it's otherwise required by the law.

## Enquiries

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with Dynarch.com, you can contact us by email via the [Contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact.html) section on our site.
