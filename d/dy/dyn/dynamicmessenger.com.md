# Dynamics Direct, Inc.

At Dynamics Direct, we strive to maintain the trust of our clients, business partners, and e-mail recipients-we do so by utilizing permission-based e-mail marketing approaches, by discouraging "spamming" (the sending or posting of large-scale, mass unsolicited e-mails or other messages), and by working with clients and business partners whom we believe place a high value on privacy. 

  
Dynamics Direct does not sell, rent, trade or otherwise distribute to any third party any personally identifiable information that we collect through the Dynamics Direct website, our Dynamics Direct Client Center, or our e-mail messages, tracking/reporting services, without the permission of the person or entity to which such information relates. 

When you browse the Dynamics Direct website (www.dynamicsdirect.com), you do so anonymously and we do not use cookies on our website. We do collect user information in two areas of our website-1) the interactive demo, and 2) the downloadable case study section. The interactive demo collects your first name and e-mail address so that you can experience a demonstration of the Dynamics Direct technology first-hand. However, this information is used solely for the demonstration and all information is stored and used for internal purposes only. The downloadable case study section requires users to submit information identifing themselves, this information is collected and used for internal purposes only. We do not use any personally identifiable information other than for the above-stated purposes. 

We also log your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) to give us an idea of the parts of our website that you visit and how long you spend there. We also may collect other non-personally identifiable information that is used to help us better understand your user experience. 

  
DDI requires that every email sent by our customers using our software complies with the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003-2004. We encourage our customers and partners to give email recipients a clear choice whether they want to receive email messages. These choices are collected through appropriate notice and disclosure and a clear opportunity to express choice, including both opt-in and opt-out methods. 

On its customers' behalf, Dynamics Direct may collect e-mail addresses of people who request to be added to the e-mail list of a Dynamics Direct customer. These e-mail addresses are forwarded to the Dynamics Direct customer. Dynamics Direct never uses these addresses for its own purposes and does not rent or sell these addresses to third parties.

  
Dynamics Direct does not condone or encourage spamming practices and we do not knowingly participate in such activities. In addition, we only work with clients and partners who believe in and follow similar anti-spamming policies. 

  
Clients have 24-hour access to the Dynamics Direct Client Center to view/collect information on a particular e-mail campaign. Each user is required to log in to the Client Center via a secure URL that prompts users for a unique, pre-defined username and password. We do not disclose any of this information to third parties-this is strictly for clients to use to access campaign reports and/or for Dynamics Direct to use to better serve your needs. 

  
Visitors to the Dynamics Direct website, recipients of a Dynamics Direct e-mail messages, and any persons who correspond with Dynamics Direct, our clients or our business partners will oftentimes submit personal information to receive information about Dynamics Direct or to receive a sample e-mail demonstration. All information collected (such as your name, e-mail address, phone/fax numbers, and postal address) is submitted voluntarily and will be used only for its intended purposes.
