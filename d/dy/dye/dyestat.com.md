Privacy Policy

Welcome to the DyeStat web site, owned and produced by Student Sports, Inc. All Products and Services offered by DyeStat, whether on the DyeStat web site or through any other medium or method of commerce or communication, are made available subject to this Privacy Policy. By using our Products and Services, you agree, without limitation or qualification, to be bound by this Privacy Policy or any other privacy or data collection policy applicable to the DyeStat web site and to receive any required legal notices regarding our privacy practices through the continuous posting of a clear and conspicuous link to the current version of this Privacy Policy throughout the DyeStat web site near the bottom of most pages. If you become an inactive user, we will adhere to the policies and practices as described in this Privacy Policy, which may be revised from time to time. Please note that DyeStat does not collect any personal information from persons who are younger than 13 years of age. 

Please note that the DyeStat web site may contain links to other sites and that, unless you decide to opt out, DyeStat may share certain data with affiliate or subsidiary corporations or with certain marketing partners. Web sites that are linked to the DyeStat web site or those which carry the DyeStat brand for co-branding or marketing purposes may have privacy policies which differ from that of DyeStat.  


**1\. WHAT INFORMATION OF YOURS DOES DYESTAT COLLECT?**

We collect data that allows us to better understand you and your interests and to communicate with you about information, products and services you may be interested in. In doing so, DyeStat collects information which makes you different from its other unique users. 

Information collected online is usually defined as being either anonymous or personally identifiable. 

Anonymous information refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, DyeStat collects information each time a visitor comes to the DyeStat web site so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. DyeStat collects the visitor's IP address, referral data (e.g., the Internet address of the last Web page visited by a user before clicking over to a DyeStat Network site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser or a Macintosh platform). DyeStat collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. This information is collected for all visitors to sparqtraining.com. 

Personally identifiable information refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name, email address or postal address. DyeStat collects personal information in several different ways, including, but not limited to, the following:  


  * 1\. DyeStat Mail: Signing up to receive our e-newsletter or e-mail promotional notices, requires that we capture and store your e-mail address 
  * 2\. Correspondence: If you contact DyeStat, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any email addresses of those who communicate with the DyeStat network via email. We use the information provided so that we may respond to the email. 



**2\. WHAT ORGANIZATION IS COLLECTING YOUR INFORMATION**

When you register for a service at the DyeStat web site your personal information is generally collected and maintained by DyeStat and may be shared with our subsidiaries, affiliates or marketing partners. If you would prefer that DyeStat not share this information with our partners, please click here . Please note that you will no longer receive email communications from DyeStat. 

Be aware that DyeStat business partners, sponsors or advertisers may have links on the DyeStat web site that take you to external sites. Some of these sites may collect personally identifiable information from you, and third-party advertising networks for DyeStat. While DyeStat hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users, the DyeStat Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and DyeStat does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties. 

**3\. HOW DOES THE DYESTAT NETWORK USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?**

DyeStat requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across the DyeStat web site, including personalization services, interactive communications, and much more. Most of these Products and Services are available to you at no cost, and DyeStat may at some point display advertisements so we can continue to provide great content and services. We can also better prepare future content based on your interests. If at any time you no longer wish to receive DyeStat Services or Communications that require your personal information, please click here to remove your personal information from our database. 

The following are examples of how DyeStat may use the information it collects: 

DyeStat uses the information collected (both anonymous and personal) to personalize and enhance the content you see on the DyeStat web site. In some cases, our Products and Services cannot work unless you have volunteered accurate information. 

DyeStat may collect anonymous data and share it with third-party advertisers in an aggregate form. We may disclose to those advertisers the numbers of DyeStat users who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on a particular display. We may also disclose to those advertisers the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed as part of this process. 

DyeStat also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the DyeStat web site, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. We do not track what pages individual users are browsing, but rather how well each page performs overall. Without such data, we would not know which parts of the DyeStat Network are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately. 

DyeStat may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on the DyeStat web site, issues regarding your account, or DyeStat Terms and Conditions violations or suspensions. 

Unless you told DyeStat that you did not want us to share your personal information with subsidiaries, affiliates or marketing partners, these third parties may use that information to contact you about products and services that may be of interest to you. 

**4\. WHAT CAN YOU DO TO BETTER PROTECT YOURSELF ON THE INTERNET?**

**Know the risks.**  
Meeting new people in an online community (chat room, forum, newsgroup, message board, Web page, etc.) is one of the best things about the Internet, but you should always be careful about disclosing personal information such as an actual name, member name, email address, and so on. This information may be collected and used by others within the online community to send unsolicited email messages from other parties, outside the DyeStat web site. Some of the messages you receive may be useful to you, but some may not. In an effort to curtail unsolicited email, DyeStat blocks certain email addresses and domains from sending messages to email addresses at our domains. 

**Educate yourself.**  
Search the Web for as much information as you can about how to protect your privacy. Look for a privacy policy on the Web sites you visit.
