In accordance with the [Guidelines for Federal and ACT Government Websites](http://www.privacy.gov.au/) issued by the Australian Privacy Commissioner, the Australian Government Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) provides the following privacy statement.

Our policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information and how we use it.

As a general rule, we do not collect personal information about you when you visit our website. You can generally visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing other personal information, unless you choose to provide such information to us. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our website.

The staff who operate FaHCSIA websites are subject to the [Privacy Act 1988](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004A03712 "Privacy Act 1988"). This Act lays down strict privacy safeguards that Commonwealth Government departments and agencies must observe in handling personal information.

## Collection of personal information

Your email address will only be recorded if you choose to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-dss). It will only be used for the purpose for which you have provided it and will not be added to a mailing list. We will not use your email address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it, without your consent.

If we ask you for any other personal information we will tell you how we intend to use that personal information if you choose to give it to us. If at any time you believe we have not adhered to the principles referred to in this privacy statement or have any other comments on these principles, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-dss).

## Security of information

FaHCSIA recognises the insecure nature of email. While every effort to maintain your confidentiality is taken, we are unable to guarantee the privacy of information transmitted via this system.

Your personal information is protected under the confidentiality and secrecy provisions contained within social security, disability, child support and family assistance law. These laws prohibit any person from accessing, using or disclosing any personal information in the possession of FaHCSIA except when performing their duties in accordance with these laws or in specific situations permitted by the law. Your personal information will not be made available to any person or agency unless the law permits or your permission is given. Penalties apply to those who fail to observe these provisions.

Before you consider transmitting any confidential information over the Internet, you should first contact FaHCSIA to seek its agreement to the application of the 'confidential' classification to the information you wish to provide. When FaHCSIA agrees to treat your personal information as 'confidential' it will receive the appropriate level of security.

While FaHCSIA endeavours to provide a secure Internet environment, please note that the privacy of your personal information cannot be guaranteed if you choose to transmit that information over the Internet.

If you do not wish to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-dss) via the Internet, FaHCSIA provides alternative ways to obtain and provide information. Please contact FaHCSIA by telephone or post if you have concerns about the security of your email message. When you telephone the Department, you can request access to FaHCSIA facsimile numbers.
