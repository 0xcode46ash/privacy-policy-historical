# Privacy Policy

## This Privacy Policy sets out:

  * Matters of which you should be aware regarding information we may collect about you;
  * Our policies on the management of personal information; 
  * Generally, the type of information we hold, for what purposes, and how we collect, hold, use and disclose that information; and 
  * How you may obtain details of the information we collect from you. 



**Respecting your privacy**  
We understand the importance of protecting your right to privacy of your personal information.  We have policies and appropriate procedures to ensure that all personal information, no matter how or where it is obtained, is handled sensitively, securely, and as required by the law.  We are committed to supporting the Australian Privacy Principles ( **APP** ) which set clear standards for the collection, access, storage and use of personal information which we obtain as part of our business operations.

**What personal information do we collect and store?**  
So that we can provide services to you, we may ask for personal details such as your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address. Some examples of where we may need these details are pre-orders, home deliveries, competitions and promotions and when you opt-in to receiving marketing newsletters from Dick Smith. We may also record your server address, domain name, the date and time of your visit to our website and the information downloaded (see below for more information).  Privacy law requires us to collect personal information about you only from you if it is reasonable and practical to do so.  
Dick Smith takes measures to ensure your personal information is protected from unauthorised access, loss, misuse, disclosure or alteration. We also take measures to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information when it is no longer required. The types of measures we take vary with the type of information, and how it is collected and stored.  
Generally, you have no obligation to provide any information requested by us. If you choose to withhold requested information however, we may not be able to provide you with the goods and services that depend on the collection of that information, particularly if the collection of that information is required by law.

**How is personal information used?**  
The personal information that we ask for is generally used to provide goods or services to you. For example, for a credit card transaction we need your card number, and for a competition we need your contact details so we can contact you if you win.  
We may also use your personal information in other ways to provide you with superior service. This may include using your personal information to advise you of new products and services, including for marketing and re-marketing purposes. You have the right to tell us that you do not want us to send information to you other than for the main purpose for which we have collected your personal details.  
Where possible, we try to ensure that our disclosure of information to other organisations (for example market researchers, and others with whom we have commercial arrangements) is in a way which does not personally identify individuals.  
Under the APP, it is our duty to inform you about our disclosure of personal information to any overseas recipients.  In some circumstances it may be necessary for us to disclose information to overseas recipients, including, in Sri Lanka to assist us in the ongoing development of our website and data management systems to ensure that we deliver the best possible services to our customers; in the Philippines for the purposes of customer support and complaint handling; our related entity in New Zealand for the purposes of sharing information for general data and product management purposes, and our related entity in Hong Kong  for the purposes of sharing information for general data and product management purposes.   
We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the above overseas recipients do not breach the APPs in relation to the disclosed personal information.
