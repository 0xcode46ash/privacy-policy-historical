DSMtuners respects the privacy of our visitors and site members. We commit ourselves to protecting your privacy and explain in detail what information we collect and how it is used below. 

**What we collect**  
DSMtuners collects personal information from you when you register to participate, enter a contest, or complete a survey on our website. Personal information consists of your email address, first name, last name, password, street address and zipcode. If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or survey we may also ask you for some demographic information such as your age or income range. Other information collected may include your IP address, browser type and operating system. 

**How we use this info**  
The information collected is used for administration purposes and to help improve the services we provide. This information will not be sold, rented or disclosed in any way to outside parties unless required to do so by law. We also may disclose aggregated information (for example, X number of our viewers visit the Gallery section) to third parties. 

**Use of cookies**  
We set and access cookies on your computer each time you access our website. These cookies are used to determine whether you have been to our website before, to automatically store your password, and to ensure the efficient use of ad rotation. 

**Receiving Email from us**  
We occasionally send out email to our members to announce site news and updates (no more than once per month). This email only goes out to those who have chosen to receive email from our website. If you no longer wish to receive news or updates, you can change this option setting in your profile. 

This policy is subject to change, so please check back periodically. Direct all questions regarding this policy to the [webmaster](https://web.archive.org/misc/contact).
