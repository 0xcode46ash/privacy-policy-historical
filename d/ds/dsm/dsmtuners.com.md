Terms of Use  
---  
  
By contributing or submitting content in the form of forum postings, photographs, or any other content, you automatically grant (or warrant that the owner of such rights has expressly granted) us an irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable and worldwide right and license to use, copy, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from and sell and distribute such materials or incorporate such materials into any form, medium or technology without compensation to you. In addition, you warrant that all so-called moral rights in those materials have been waived. None of the materials shall be subject to any obligation of confidence on the part of DSMtuners.   
  
  
Privacy Policy  
---  
  
DSMtuners respects the privacy of our visitors and site members. We commit ourselves to protecting your privacy and explain in detail what information we collect and how it is used below. 

**What we collect**  
DSMtuners collects personal information from you when you register to participate, enter a contest, or complete a survey on our website. Personal information consists of your email address, first name, last name, password, street address and zipcode. If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or survey we may also ask you for some demographic information such as your age or income range. Other information collected may include your IP address, browser type and operating system. 

**How we use this info**  
The information collected is used for administration purposes and to help improve the services we provide. This information will not be sold, rented or disclosed in any way to outside parties unless required to do so by law. We also may disclose aggregated information (for example, X number of our viewers visit the Gallery section) to third parties. 

**Use of cookies**  
We set and access cookies on your computer each time you access our website. These cookies are used to determine whether you have been to our website before, to automatically store your password, and to ensure the efficient use of ad rotation. 

**Receiving Email from us**  
We occasionally send out email to our members to announce site news and updates (no more than once per month). This email only goes out to those who have chosen to receive email from our website. If you no longer wish to receive news or updates, you can change this option setting in your profile. 

This policy is subject to change, so please check back periodically. Direct all questions regarding this policy to the [webmaster](https://web.archive.org/contactus.php).  
  
  
Email Policy  
---  
  
Why we don't allow registrations using free email accounts (like Hotmail or Yahoo):

Free web-based email accounts make it difficult to block banned users from posting in our forums. It's easy to setup multiple free email accounts, which makes it possible for an individual to setup multiple DSMtuners accounts using different email addresses. This creates an obvious problem when trying to keep problem members out for good. 

You must use a unique email address to register on our site. This can be one issued to you by your ISP , a registered domain name, or your office email address. Those are your only options available if you're interested in posting messages or content on our site. We apologize to all those people who depend on free web-based email accounts to do their web browsing, but we must take all the necessary steps to ensure that our community maintains a high level of quality. Again, we apologize for the inconvenience. Please do not ask us to make an exception for you - we will not. 

If you would like to set up your free email account to receive notifications from our site because you rarely check the email account you registered with, it is possible to do so. Most free email accounts allow you to check email from multiple accounts. For example, in Yahoo Mail, you can go to Mail Options > Mail Accounts. Then set up a new account using the username/password/server path from your ISP email account (the one you registered with). Another way to do it is to set up a Rule in Outlook (for your registered email account), that forwards all email from DSMtuners to your free email account. We hope this helps.   
  
  
AOL Policy  
---  
  
What you should know if you use an AOL account to connect to our site: 

If you are an AOL user, you may find it difficult to participate on our site. Without going into heavy detail on how vBulletin (our forum software) works, let us just say that AOL makes it difficult for forum administrators to ban specific AOL members from posting. AOL uses dynamic IP addresses, which means that many AOL users share the same IP address. This means that if we ban an AOL IP address, many other AOL users can potentially be affected when trying to login to our site. 

We apologize if this happens to you, but you'll have to take it up with the people at AOL - not us. They choose to use dynamic IP addresses, which makes it difficult on all forum administrators. They've also shown no interest in helping sites like ours solve the problem or track down fraudulent or problematic users of their service. Until they change the way they conduct business and the way they address site owners like us, we'll continue to encourage all AOL users to consider alternate ways of connecting to the internet, especially if you plan on participating in online discussion forums like ours.   
  
  
About Us  
---  
  
DSMtuners is in no way affiliated with Diamond Star Motors, Mitsubishi Motors, Chrysler, Eagle, or Plymouth corporations. We are a web community which promotes the sharing of ideas and communication between all of our members in a respectful and honest manner. 

**Our Mission**  
The number one goal of DSMtuners is to promote the modifying of DSM cars for increased performance. On our site, image and styling take a back seat to substance and real world performance. We cater to the performance enthusiast, promoting the sharing of information and ideas regarding modifications, parts, and the results of those modifications. We are an inclusive community that isn't selective in our registration process, however we do demand a certain level of respect and maturity from our members. We have a small set of [rules and policies](http://dsmtuners.com/forums/faq.php?faq=faq_general#faq_rules) that everyone is required to follow. 

Our site features one of the largest (if not the largest) group of DSM enthusiasts on the internet. We have the highest number of knowledgable and experienced DSM enthusiasts around who are willing to help others. With that, however, comes an even larger number of new DSM enthusiasts who need to be educated. We work as hard, or harder than any other auto enthusiast site on the web to ensure the beginner enthusiasts get as much out of our site as the hardcore racers. We discourage elitist and negative attitudes and encourage teaching and helping. At the same time, beginners are taught how to do their own research and to not spread rumors and misinformation. We feel this creates an environment everyone will benefit from for years to come. 

DSMtuners takes pride in having a community that's knowledgable, experienced, and most of all helpful and friendly; attributes that are difficult to find all in one site. Register today for access to participate in our forums, our photo gallery, our free Classifieds system, and to search our Tech Forums database for valuable DSM modification information. 

**Background**  
This site is owned and operated by Speed Tuners Network, LLC; a small company of enthusiasts who designed, built and have grown this site from the ground up. We own and operate a small network of community websites focused on tuning and modifications for passionate grass roots enthusiasts. Our network of sites include: [DSMtuners.com](http://www.dsmtuners.com/), [WRXtuners.com](http://www.wrxtuners.com/), and [EVOtuners.net](http://www.evotuners.net/). We are commited to bringing you more than any other enthusiast site on the web. While any "average Joe" can open up an online message board these days, we've invested countless hours in building content and features that make our site unique and complete. What sets us apart is that we don't rely 100% on our forum members for content generation. The forums are only one aspect of our site, as where they are the only aspect on others. We create content ourselves regularly and introduce sections and features that are not found elsewhere. We are dedicated to this site full time and it shows. Login and enjoy the benefits.
