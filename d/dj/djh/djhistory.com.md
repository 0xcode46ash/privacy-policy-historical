# Privacy | DJhistory.com

We value our privates so we protect your privacy carefully, and make sure your personal details don't fall into the wrong hands. We follow all UK regulations about holding personal data, including the Data Protection Act and the Freedom of Information Act. DJ History Limited is registered as a Data Controller with the Information Commissioner's Office ([](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "www.ico.gov.uk")[www.ico.gov.uk](http://www.ico.gov.uk/)). We may change our privacy policy from time to time, so please check for updates.

## Your information

If you join [](http://www.djhistory.com/ "www.djhistory.com")[www.djhistory.com](http://www.djhistory.com/) we take your name, country and email address, so we can let you post content on the public areas of the site, and email you about new releases, special tracks and other DJhistory news. We will only email you if you have given your permission, or to contact you about an order. When you buy something we collect the information we need to complete your order, including name, address, email address, payment details and your delivery address for any physical items. We will keep a record of what you buy. In the case of downloads, this means if you lose music you bought from us you can return to the site and download it again. We may also use these records to get an idea of your music tastes so we can suggest other things you might like. The only other time we would share your information is if required to do so by law, in connection with legal proceedings, to defend our legal rights, or to prevent fraud.

## Security

When you enter your card details these go straight to an extremely secure server at our payment gateway (or PayPal if you're paying that way). We don't keep any of your payment details. Stay safe by keeping your username and password secret, change your password regularly and log out at the end of each session. Tell us immediately if anyone uses your login without your permission, or about any other breach of the website's security.
