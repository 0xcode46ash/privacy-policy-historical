# Privacy Policy | DJA - Don Jagoda Associates, Inc.

We know how important privacy is, so here is our policy for the  
whole world to see.

**Don Jagoda Associates, Inc. Privacy Policy**  
_(last revised: January 29, 2013)_

Don Jagoda Associates, Inc. (DJA) is a sales promotion agency that operates sweepstakes, contests, games and incentive and loyalty programs (“Promotions”) on behalf of its clients.  Such Promotions collect personally identifiable information from those individuals who choose to enter a particular Promotion. DJA takes its privacy obligations both to its clients very seriously. DJA adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as established by the European Commission and the United States Department of Commerce.

This policy outlines our treatment of personally identifiable information we collect on behalf of our clients. DJA collects personally identifiable information for its clients on-line (including mobile), DJA Post Office boxes, and points of entry offline. DJA  collects such personally identifiable information solely for the use of its clients and the administration of the Promotions. DJA does not use any of the data collected itself, other than to notify potential winners and for prize fulfillment purposes in connection with a Promotion.  DJA strictly limits access to all personally identifiable information within its organization, and data is never shared outside of the company for any reason (except for appropriate governmental or legal requests). Personally identifiable information collected by DJA on behalf of a client belongs solely to the client and will be used solely in accordance with that particular client’s Privacy Policy. An individual’s desire to “opt-out” of receiving marketing or other information from a client will be handled in accordance with a particular client’s Privacy Policy.

DJA collects data other than personally identifiable information for Promotions it operates online. DJA may collect information about your computer configuration, such as your browser type, operating system, or ISP domain name. DJA may also collect information about your activity during your visit to the Promotion site. This information will not reveal your personal identity (it is anonymous), may be used by DJA to administer the technical and operational aspects of a site, and may include using your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server.  DJA may use a cookie, a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive, to assist in performing some or all of these activities (including for COPPA purposes, see below) and also to limit your ability to play a Promotion more times than allowed per the Rules of a Promotion. You can set your browser to accept all, some, or no cookies. If you set your browser to reject all cookies, you may be limited in your ability to access some, or all aspects of a particular Promotion.Unless otherwise specifically indicated, DJA Promotions are not open to anyone under the age of thirteen (13). DJA does, however, operate some Promotions on behalf of its clients which collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In each such instance, DJA and its clients comply fully with all aspects of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) in the operation of the Promotion, in the collection of the information itself and in the subsequent use of the data collected. Personally identifiable information will not be collected from children under the age of thirteen (13) without parental consent in compliance with the COPPA guidelines.
