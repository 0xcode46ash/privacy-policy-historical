_Personal Information_ . We collect personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that you submit to us such as your name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, fax number, credit card or other payment information, age, birthdate, login name, password, and place of worship.

Access to certain areas of our site and certain functions, such as purchasing products, may be limited to those visitors who provide us with required Personal Information. 

Certain services or products we offer may be tailored to a specific denomination. As such, we may ask you to identify your place of worship. You will, of course, have the option to decline to provide this information; however, if it is required for a particular service or product, you will be unable to obtain that service or product if you decline to provide it.

If you supply us with your postal address and opt in to receiving such information, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information on new products and services. Visitors who supply us with their telephone numbers and opt in to receiving calls may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding new products and services. 

Visitors who supply us with their email address may receive email from us with information regarding new products and services. We may also occasionally send an email on behalf of a partner ministry. Additionally, we may share Personal Information with our ministry and business partners to facilitate our provision of goods or services requested by the visitor and, if you opt in, we may share your Personal Information with affiliates, strategic partners, agents, third party marketers or other parties who are offering products or services that we believe may be of service or interest to you, or who may contact you with an offer or advertisement, or they may use such information for research or business purposes (such as analyzing usage data of our website), or other purposes as may be disclosed to you. 

## Disclosure of Personal Information

To help us provide you with superior service, timely completion of purchases and returns, as well as accurate shipments, we may share certain information relating to you within the David C Cook corporate family of entities. We may also share certain Personal Information with strategic, co-branded, or joint partners and with third party processors and vendors, as necessary, to process your orders or requests and otherwise administer the account (however, we will only share credit or debit card information as required to effectively process your credit or debit card payment), or to analyze trends and use of our website. These entities help us provide many important services to you, such as extending credit, fulfilling and shipping orders, providing customer service and performing customer satisfaction surveys. We also may share information with third parties to verify information collected from you in order to protect against potential fraud, and we may receive Personal Information about you from these parties. Your election to opt-out of the data sharing in the section entitled “How to Opt Out of Future Communications” is not an opt-out for the data sharing described in this paragraph. 

On occasion, we may be (or have a good faith belief that we are) required by law or litigation to disclose Personal Information pertaining to you. We may also disclose such information if we determine that for national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance or safety, disclosure is necessary. At times, we may share Personal Information in aggregate, anonymized so that no one individual can be identified. 

We may also transfer Personal Information to a third party as a result of a sale or acquisition, merger, or bankruptcy involving us. 

If you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information, we may transfer that information to our affiliates and subsidiaries or to other third parties, across borders, and from your country or jurisdiction to other countries or jurisdictions around the world. If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personally identifiable information to the United States which does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and by providing your personally identifiable information you consent to (a) the use of your personally identifiable information for the uses identified above in accordance with this Privacy Policy; and (b) the transfer of your personally identifiable information to the United States as indicated above. 

## Independent Contractors 

From time to time, we may use certain independent contractors and other third parties to operate components of our site, fulfill orders, or assist us in operating or improving our site. In this capacity, we may allow these independent contractors and third parties to collect the information described in this Privacy Policy for us. 

## How to Opt Out of Future Communications

If you would like to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us or our partners in the future, please let us know by visiting us at www.davidccook.com/unsubscribe.cfm. (Unsubscribe links are also included at the bottom of marketing and promotional emails.) Please note: unsubscribing from marketing and promotional communications will not prevent us from sending you communications about items, products, or services that you have previously purchased (such as information about product upgrades or recalls) or to inform you about other issues relating to our existing relationship with you, including but not limited to, confirming an order, updating you on order status, and informing you about changes to this Privacy Policy.

## Cookies

“Cookies” are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser. They enable our systems to recognize you through your browser, when you log on, and to provide you certain personalized features, including the storage of items in your shopping cart in between visits. 

Like most other companies that engage in online commerce, we use “cookies” and other technologies to identify which parts of our website are the most popular, how easily our website is navigated, and how much time our customers spend in each section. This is standard practice with many similar companies, and it helps us structure our website to meet your unique needs and make our website more friendly. Among other uses, cookies also help us customize your experience with us, by enabling us to remember what products you may have looked at previously, identify who you are so that we can customize a greeting for you, and so we can personalize our other, sometimes unrelated, interactions with you. You may, of course, choose to disable the cookies, but, if you do, certain functions or areas of our website will become unavailable to you as a result. 

Some of our email or electronic communications to you may include a “click-through URL” linked to a particular page on our website. By clicking on one of these URLs, you will automatically enter our website. Our systems track this information to gauge the effectiveness of our email communications and your level of interest in particular areas. You may avoid having this information collected by avoiding clicking on URL links in our communications. Please note, that we will NEVER send you an email with an embedded link that asks for your password or any financial or account information; passwords are for your protection. If you EVER receive such an email, please contact us immediately using the contact information provided above. 

We also use pixel tags to identify what pages of our website are visited most frequently and to evaluate the effectiveness of the search functions on our website.

You click on those ads at your own risk.
