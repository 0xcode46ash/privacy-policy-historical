# DCCCD - Privacy and Security Policy

[](http://www.dcccd.edu/images/wmlrg.map)

### Privacy and Security Commitment

* * *

#### Our Promise to You

Dallas County Community College District's (DCCCD) Privacy Commitment is based on two simple ideas. We promise to:

  * Comply with all the applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations; and
  * Protect your privacy while still offering relevant, personalized service.



DCCCD is a public higher education institution and therefore bound by the Texas Public Information Act and the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). Continue reading for more detailed information about DCCCD's Privacy and Security Commitment. 

  


#### Texas Public Information Act

The [Texas Public Information Act](http://www.oag.state.tx.us/AG_Publications/txts/2002publicinfohb.htm) requires disclosure of information by a public body -- unless the law specifically protects the information. Most information kept by a public body is public under the Act. The State Attorney General enforces this Act.

#### Family Education Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA)

[FERPA](http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/fpco/ferpa/index.html) protects educational records of a student from public disclosure without written permission of the student. Although many exceptions to the Act exist, the exceptions are very limited. The Department of Education enforces this Act.

#### What FERPA requires DCCCD to release (unless you request that your information be withheld)

To comply with [FERPA](http://www.ed.gov/offices/OM/fpco/ferpa/index.html), DCCCD may release information classified as "directory information" to the general public without the written consent of the student. Directory information includes:

  * name;
  * home address; 
  * home telephone number; 
  * email addresses;
  * field of study;
  * photograph;
  * date and place of birth;
  * dates of attendance;
  * enrollment status, i.e., full-time, part-time, undergraduate, graduate;
  * degrees, certificates and other honors and awards received;
  * the type of award received, i.e., academic, technical, tech-prep, or continuing education;
  * participation in officially recognized activities;
  * weight and height of members of athletic teams;
  * student classification; 
  * name of the most recent previous institution attended; or,
  * similar information.



#### How to request that your directory information be withheld

A student may request that the institution withhold from the public all or any part of the student's directory information. To request withholding of this information, a student shall give written notice (in person, by mail or fax) to the Registrar's Office during the first 12 class days of a Fall or Spring semester or the first four class days of a Summer session. If they are unable to provide written notice within these time frames, credit students may protect their directory information at any time during the academic year through [eConnect's](http://econnect.dcccd.edu/econnect/st/stmenu.html) 'My Privacy' feature. If a request to withhold information is not made, the institution shall release all directory information. 

Directory information is released only upon written request unless permitted by law. Telephone requests are not acceptable. Transcripts or academic records are not released without a student's written consent except as allowed by law.

#### Information collected by DCCCD

DCCCD's webservers record only the visitor's Internet Protocol (IP) address, but not the email address. We collect only information that is volunteered by the visitor (e.g. survey information, online applications or requests for more information).

#### Cookies and how they are used

We use [cookies](http://www.darwinmag.com/learn/curve/column.html?ArticleID=8) to:

  * Store visitors' preferences;
  * Record session information;
  * Record user-specific information on what pages visitors visit;
  * Customize webpage content on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.



#### How to view your information

Currently enrolled (or recently enrolled) credit students who are registered at one of DCCCD's nine locations can obtain access to their personal information through [eConnect](http://econnect.dcccd.edu/econnect/st/stmenu.html), a secure web interface that requires you to enter your student identification number and a password. The following information is available to registered students:

  * Class schedule information
  * Email address
  * Financial Aid information
  * Grades
  * Payment information
  * Student ID number
  * Student Information Profile
  * Registration summary/fee receipts that contain: 
    * Address
    * Class schedule information
    * Student ID number



#### How to update/correct your student record

Currently enrolled (or recently enrolled students) credit students can correct their Student Information Profile and email address online through [eConnect](http://econnect.dcccd.edu/econnect/st/stmenu.html).

If any of the remaining personal information in your student record contains an error, please visit the Registrar's Office and request that the error be corrected. Make sure you take a photo identification card with you. Dallas TeleCollege students should visit the Dallas TeleCollege [Registrar](http://telecollege.dcccd.edu/Admissions/GettingStarted/default.htm) website.

#### Security

DCCCD has carefully implemented the information technology industry's best practices in security measures to ensure that:  
1) the information you entrust to us is not intercepted or abused; and 2) to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. 

Industry standard technologies like Secure Socket Layers (SSL) are used to protect your credit card information, email address, social security number and other information so it cannot be read as it travels on the Internet. [Verisign](http://www.verisign.com/), the leading provider of digital trust services, provides secure payment processing for your online transactions with DCCCD's [eConnect](http://econnect.dcccd.edu/econnect/st/stmenu.html).
