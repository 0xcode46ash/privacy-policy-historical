## DC'S CONTEST POLICY AND POLICY FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE.)

DC conducts promotions on its web site where a visitor may win a pair of DC's shoes. These promotions are open to visitors aged 13 and younger. DC asks all visitors 13, including visitors aged 13 and younger, to fill out a survey so that DC can learn more about it's customers and the effectiveness of it's advertising. The survey does not request any personally identifying information. Except for a visitor's email address, DC does not collect any other information on it's web site from kids under 13 years of age. Contest winners are randomly selected. Upon submission of a contest entry form, contest entrants are immediately notified on the web site whether they have won. Contest winners must then print out a form that appears on the web site that the winner (and, if the winner is under 13 years of age, his or her parent or guardian) must fill out and send to the address provided on the form. Upon receipt of the fully filled out form DC will send the winner a pair of shoes in a size and style selected by the winner.

DC collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the use of our site. When visitors request pages from our site, our servers log the visitor's IP addressees.
