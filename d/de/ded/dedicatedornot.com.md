## What Is Dedicated Hosting?

Dedicated web hosting, sometimes called a dedicated host, managed host, or dedicated server, is storage space that resides on a web server with the sole intention of servicing a single website or technology. These types of servers are usually leased directly from a web host provider, and can even have the option of a dedicated server administrator to manage. Dedicated hosting also provides full control of the web server's abilities.
