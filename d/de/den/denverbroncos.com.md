Cookies: As with many Web sites, our Web site uses a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a unique, random number that is stored in the browser on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify you, just the computer that is used to visit the site. Cookies automatically identify your browser to the Web site whenever your computer is used to visit the Web site. Cookies also let us know how many people visit our web site and where visitors go on the site. In addition, cookies can let us know non-personally identifiable information, like what web browser is being used to access the web site. For registered users, cookies can make using the Web site easier for you by saving information such as your passwords or preferences. By tracking how and when you use the Web site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Web site are based on data obtained from cookies. Accepting cookies allows you, among other things, to personalize your experience on the Web site. Cookies may also allow the Web site to present to you advertising which may be of interest to you. For these reasons, cookies are tied to your personally identifiable information. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, your browser should contain an option that allows you to disable or delete cookie data at any time. Some areas of the Web site, however, may not provide you with a personalized experience if you have disabled the use of cookies. Some of our business partners (i.e. tracking utility company) may set cookies on our site. We have no access or control of these third party cookies. We use a third party tracking utility company that uses cookies to track personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics to improve our Web site.

IP Addresses and Click-Stream Data: We may collect IP addresses and/or click-stream data. An IP address is a number associated with the service through which you access the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. At times, we also use IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers and sponsors, for example regarding the frequency with which our guests visit various parts of our sites. We may combine this information with personally identifiable information. Click-stream data is information collected by our computers when you request Web pages from the Web site. Click-stream data may include such information as the page served, the time, the source of the request, the type of browser making the request, the preceding page view and other such non-personal information. When analyzed, this data helps us analyze how visitors arrive at the Web site, what type of content is most popular, what type of visitors in the aggregate are interested in particular kinds of content and advertising, and the like.

Web Beacons and Other Tracking Technology: The Site uses a variety of technical methods for tracking purposes, including Web beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We also use these technical methods to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web sites, such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web sites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We also use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that we send our guests to determine whether our guests have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails.

Transaction Information: If you conduct a financial transaction with our Web site, such as buy our products, we will ask you to complete an order form that will request certain information from you, including contact information, demographic information and financial information.

For your protection, such information is collected and stored through encrypted means.

Examples include fulfilling orders, sending e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, Web site analysis, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They may have access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for their own purposes, like sending you marketing offers about their products.
