# Privacy

### VISIT DENVER Online Privacy Policy

VISIT DENVER is committed to maintaining your confidence and trust, and accordingly maintains the following privacy policy to protect personal information you provide online.

### Basic Confidentiality Policy

It is VISIT DENVER policy that personal information, such as your name, postal, and e-mail address and telephone number, is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, accessible only by designated staff, and used only for the purposes for which you provide the information (such as to reply to your request or to enlist in a contest). 

If you also indicate on our site that you would like to receive information about other VISIT DENVER programs and services, your personal information will be added to appropriate mailing lists. If at any time you change your mind and would like to add or remove your name from VISIT DENVER mailing list, or update your personal information, please email us at info@visitdenver.com.

### No Release of Information to Third Parties

Personal information will not be released to third parties except to further the purpose for which you provide the information, such as requesting information from VISIT DENVER or a member for an action. There are no other circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal information to third parties.

### No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information

Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses (unless specifically requested for contesting or other opt-in offers). For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not names, addresses or other information that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. This information is used only for internal purposes by VISIT DENVER technical support staff.

Site information is used to confirm participation in VISIT DENVER marketing programs, and may be used to advise participants of the numbers of visitors who come to our site from their sites. No personal information is collected. 

In addition, our website tracks information about the visits to our websites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our websites, and which countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
