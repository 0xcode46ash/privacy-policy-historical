####  Member Privacy

DentaQuest takes your privacy seriously. We want to tell you about our privacy practices to protect your personal health information.

####  How Do We Use Health Information?

**DentaQuest uses and discloses your health information to facilitate your treatment, coordinate payment for treatment, and for other related health care operations. Examples of these uses and disclosures include:**

  * **Treatment:** DentaQuest discloses your health information to dentists who are providing treatment to you or coordinating care with another dentist, such as a specialist, for the purposes of facilitating your treatment. For example, we may discuss your treatment plan with your dentist.
  * **Payment:** DentaQuest uses and discloses your health information for payment purposes. For example, we pay claims submitted by dentists who provide treatment to you.
  * **Health Care Operations:** DentaQuest discloses your health information for health care operations in the normal course of our business. For example, we may use or disclose your information for purposes of underwriting, enrollment, and other activities related to creating, renewing, or replacing a benefits plan.  We may not, however, use or disclose genetic information for underwriting purposes.



We comply with all applicable state and federal laws, including any laws that impact our ability to use your health information for payment and operations.

**Other Services:**  
DentaQuest may also use or disclose your health information for other reasons. These include uses and disclosures that are:

  * Required by law, including pursuant to a court order or to health oversight agencies or law enforcement agencies.

Except as described in this notice, we may not use or disclose your information without your written authorization. You may give us written authorization to use your protected health information or to disclose it to anyone for any purpose.

Your revocation will not affect any use or disclosure permitted by the authorization while it was in effect. We need your written authorization to sell information about you to a third party or, in most circumstances, to use or disclose your information to send you communications about products and services. We do not need your written authorization, however, to send you communications about health related products or services, as long as the products or services are associated with your coverage or are offered by us.
