# Privacy Policy

**Your Privacy**  
At Denny's, we are committed to protecting your privacy.  While visiting the Denny’s site you may be asked to provide information that personally identifies you (name, address, billing address, email address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, credit card number and social security number).  The following are sample areas in the Denny’s site where we request personal information:

·         Job Inquires with Denny’s, Inc.

·         Franchise Inquiry

·         Gift Certificate Purchase

·         Customer Feedback

·         Contest Entry

·         Subscription to Informational E-mail service

·         Request Information about Denny’s

·         Real Estate Site Submission*

*The Real Estate Site Submission page of the Denny’s web site is operated by eSite, Inc.  [eSite](http://www.esite-usa.com/) is an independent market research company that, as authorized by DFO, Inc., franchisor of the Denny’s brand, will screen the real estate information submitted to determine if the proposed restaurant site meets Denny's basic site criteria.

The information that we collect is on a voluntary basis.  You may choose not to provide personal information and you still will be able to visit most of the Denny’s site.  However, you will not be able to complete the activities listed above using the web site without providing us the required personally identifiable information.  Please read on for more detail about our privacy policy.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**  
The personal information that we collect varies depending on the activity you wish to conduct on the web.  We will need more information for job inquiries, franchise inquiries, gift certificate purchase, contest entry and real estate site submission than we require for customer feedback, information request and e-mail subscriptions. 

 When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. If you have not opted out of receiving marketing materials, we may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, new Denny's services and special offers we think you'll find valuable. 

You can choose not to allow us to use your personal information for direct marketing purposes by indicating your preference at the time of collection or by responding to the promotional e-mail in the manner provided.  In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified). 

**Will Denny's disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**  
Presently, Denny's does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Denny's may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

The information submitted through the real estate site submission page is shared between eSite, Inc. and DFO, Inc.  Neither company shares your personally identifiable information with others. 

In instances when we receive customer complaints or feedback concerning specific franchised restaurants, we will forward the feedback to the franchised restaurant owner.

Other instances in which we may need to disclose personal information include:

            1.         when required by law to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on us;

            2.         to enforce our policies or agreements including the collection of amounts owed to us;

            3.         to protect users of our site(s) and our site(s) from fraudulent or abusive use.

We also reserve the right to disclose or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale, lease, merger or any other type of acquisition, disposal or financing of all or any portion of Denny’s, Inc., DFO, Inc. or Denny’s Corporation.

**Children Under the Age of 13**

While we are happy to have you visit the Denny’s web site with your children, the Denny’s site is a general audience site and is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  If you would like to enroll your child, age 10 or younger, in the Denny’s Kids’ Birthday Club, please print the form from the web site and mail it to the address listed on the form.

**Changes to Your Personal Information**

We currently do not have a process where you can review the personal information that we have on file.  However, if you have a change in personal information and would like to update our information, please contact the appropriate department, if known, or email us at [tell_us@dennys.com](mailto:tell_us@dennys.com)

**Links to Other Sites**

We may provide links to third party sites on our web site.  We are not responsible for the content or information collection practices of those other sites.  The privacy policy of other sites may differ from Denny’s privacy policy.  Please read the privacy policy of any third party web site before providing any personal information.

**Your Consent**  
By using our website and submitting the personal information requested, you consent to the collection and use of this information in the manner described in this policy by Denny's. Denny's reserves the right to change its policy in this regard at any time in the future. In the event Denny's does change its policy, a notification of such change will be posted on the website so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
