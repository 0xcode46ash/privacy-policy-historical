**How does Dennis Kirk protect customer information?** When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

We occasionally make our database list available to carefully selected companies whose products may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive mailings from these companies, please e-mail us at info@denniskirk.com. Your credit card information is only used for the order that it is supplied for. We do not keep this information or pass it along to anyone else.

Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as prefill shopping and to store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Without a cookie, you cannot use most of the features in our store.
