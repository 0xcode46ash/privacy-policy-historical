# Dennis Kirk...When you want it now

  
**How does Dennis Kirk protect customer information?**  
When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

We occasionally make our database list available to carefully selected companies whose products may be of interest to you.  If you do not wish to receive mailings from these companies, please e-mail us at [info@denniskirk.com](mailto:info@denniskirk.com).  Your credit card information is only used for the order that it is supplied for.  We do not keep this information or pass it along to anyone else. 

**What about "cookies"?**  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as prefill shopping and to store items in your shopping cart between visits. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Without a cookie, you cannot use most of the features in our store. 

**Changes to our Policy**  
Our Policy is intended to provide you with the safest and most secure shopping experience possible. 

Since offerings and technologies change, we reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Security Policy at any time without prior notice. If policy changes are substantial, we will notify our customers via email. Please periodically review our Security Policy for changes.
