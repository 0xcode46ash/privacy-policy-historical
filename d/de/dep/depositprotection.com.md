DATA PROTECTION NOTICE AND PRIVACY POLICY
DATA PROTECTION NOTICE
Uses and sharing of personal information
Your personal information will be used solely for the purpose of providing The Deposit
Protection Service, including alternative dispute resolution services (which may be provided
by a service provider nominated by The DPS) save that CLG may disclose details of your
Deposit Protection Service activities to regulators, industry bodies and other organisations for
the purposes of fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and where there are
concerns over your activities. These other organisations are required to protect your personal
information on behalf of CLG and cannot use your personal information for purposes
unconnected with The Deposit Protection Service.
The DPS will process all personal information on behalf of CLG in accordance with the Data
Protection Act 1998.
If you access The Deposit Protection Service from a website outside the European Economic
Area your personal information may have to be transferred outside the European Economic
Area to enable you to access it.
PRIVACY POLICY
Personal information collected
The DPS collects the information you are asked to provide during your registration with The
DPS or which you supply during the period that any Deposit is protected for you.
The DPS’s website and emails use common internet tools such as cookies (see further below).
CLG may instruct The DPS to collect information about you from other sources, such as
Tenants, land registry data, postal services data or other sources necessary to confirm your
identity or the instructions you provide to The DPS.
Cookies
A cookie is very small text file which a website transfers to your computer's hard drive. This
allows the website to recognise that you have visited on a previous occasion, and to
automatically restore any preferences that you may have already set. Only the website that
originally posted the cookie can retrieve it. This type of cookie is semi-permanent, typically
having a lifespan of around 3 months. After this time, the cookie expires and is automatically
removed from your computer.


The DPS does not use semi-permanent cookies. It does, however, use what is known as a
session cookie. A session cookie is a standard technique used by many web sites to
temporarily store a unique ID on a user’s computer for the duration of the time you are
viewing the web site. This session ID allows the website to maintain continuity throughout
your visit (e.g. keeping you logged-in). Session cookies do not identify you personally and are
deleted when the web browser is closed.
Please note that the websites to which this site may be linked may make use of their own
cookies to collect information from you.
Most browsers will automatically accept cookies, but it may be possible to set your browser to
notify you when it is received, at which point you can choose to accept or reject it. You must
allow session cookies for The DPS website to function correctly.
Your rights
Under the Data Protection Act 1998 you have the right to request a copy of the personal
information The DPS holds about you by writing to us at the address below. There may be a
small charge for this service. The DPS tries to ensure that all information which we hold for
you is accurate. If you find any inaccuracies please notify us and we will correct them
promptly. Communication with you may be impeded if the information we hold is inadequate
or inaccurate.
Security precautions
The DPS employs appropriate technical security measures to protect your personal
information and to ensure that it is not accessed by unauthorised persons. Information is held
on secure servers and is encrypted wherever this is possible. This is the same encryption
used to transmit credit card details over the Internet when buying merchandise online. Our
security procedures also provide that, in addition to any password which you may require to
gain access to The Deposit Protection Service, you may have to provide proof of identification
before we will release personal information to you. Multiple incorrect attempts or invalidation
will result in a lockout from the information. We undergo independent periodic reviews of our
security policies and procedures to ensure that our systems are secure and protected.
You should never divulge your identification numbers, username, or password to anyone else.
You should also never write your password down or store it on your computer.
