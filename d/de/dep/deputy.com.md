# Deputy • Privacy Policy

_Last updated 22nd October, 2012_

This Privacy Policy provides our policies and procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing your information. It is important to Deputy.com that its customers retain their privacy when using our product. So we protect the information you share by following the globally acceptable practices in customer privacy and data storage.

Users can access the Deputy.com application (the “Application”) through our website, applications on Devices, through APIs, and through third-parties. A “Device” is any computer used to access the Deputy.com Application, including without limitation a desktop, laptop, mobile phone, tablet, or other consumer electronic device. This Privacy Policy governs your access of the Deputy.com Application, regardless of how you access it, and by using our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy. All of the different forms of data, content, and information described below are collectively referred to as “information”.

### Your Information & How We Store It

Deputy.com will collect and store certain information in order for you to obtain the best use of the Application.

  1. **Information You Provide** \- When you register an account, we may collect some personal information, such as your name, phone number, credit card, or other billing information, email address and home and business postal addresses. You may also ask us to import your contacts by giving us access to your third party services (for example, your email account) or to use your social networking information if you give us access to your account on social network connection services. When you invite others to join your instance of Deputy.com we send them a one-time email invitation. We may also receive Personal Information (for example, your email address) through other users, if they have invited you to their Deputy.com instance.

  2. **Files** \- We collect and store any files you upload, download, or create (records) within the Deputy Application.

  3. **Log Data** \- When you use the Application, we automatically record information from your Device, its software, and your activity using the Services. This may include the Device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, the web page visited before you came to our website, information you search for on our website, locale preferences, identification numbers associated with your Devices, your mobile carrier, date and time stamps associated with transactions, system configuration information, metadata concerning your Files, and other interactions with the Service.

  4. **Cookies** \- We also use “cookies” to collect information and improve our Services. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your Device. We may use “persistent cookies” to save your registration ID and login password for future logins to the Service. We may use “session ID cookies” to enable certain features of the Service, to better understand how you interact with the Service and to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on the Service. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all aspects of the Application.

  5. **How We Use It** \- To allow you access to the Application, to personalize and improve your experience and to provide you with software updates and product announcements.

  6. **Geo-Location Information** \- Some Devices allow applications to access real-time location-based information (for example, GPS). We may use this information to optimize your experience. Also, some of the information we collect from a Device, for example IP address, can be used to approximate a Device’s location.

  7. **Analytics** \- Information captured (log data) may be used analytically to understand the user statistics of the Application with the view of improving the Application.




### Information Sharing & Disclosure

  1. **Your Use** \- We will display your Personal Information in your profile page, this may be accessed by other persons on association with their Deputy.com instances. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may also share or disclose your information with your consent, for example if you use a third party application to access your account (see below).

  2. **Service Providers, Business Partners and Others** \- We may use certain trusted third party companies and individuals to help us provide, analyze, and improve the Service (including but not limited to data storage, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, payment processing, and improvement of the Service’s features). These third parties may have access to your information only for purposes of performing these tasks on our behalf and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy. As of the date this policy went into effect, we use Amazon Web Services.

  3. **Third-Party Applications** \- We may share your information with a third party application with your consent, for example when you choose to access Deputy.com through such an application.

  4. **Compliance with Laws and Law Enforcement Requests; Protection of Deputy.com’s Rights** \- We may disclose to parties outside Deputy.com files stored in your Application and information about you that we collect when we have a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) comply with a law, regulation or compulsory legal request; or (b) to protect Deputy.com’s property rights. If we provide your Deputy.com files to a law enforcement agency as set forth above, we will remove Deputy.com’s encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement.

  5. **Business Transfers** \- If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction, but we will notify you (for example, via email and/or a prominent notice on our website) of any change in control or use of your Personal Information or Files, or if either become subject to a different Privacy Policy.

If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, you may contact us via our support page. We may retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your information quickly upon request and if desired make it available to you.

### Changes to our Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. If we make a change to this privacy policy that we believe materially reduces your rights, we will provide you with notice (for example, by email). And we may provide notice of changes in other circumstances as well. By continuing to use the Application after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
