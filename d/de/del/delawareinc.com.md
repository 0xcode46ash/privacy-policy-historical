# Our Privacy Policy - Incorporate your Delaware Corporation or LLC TODAY with Harvard Business Services

Protecting your privacy is important to Harvard Business Services, Inc. (Harvard). We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Harvard Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Why we collect personal information**  
Harvard collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service, special offers, and other information we think you’d like to hear about. This may occasionally include information from other companies about products and services that can add value to your Harvard products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in market research, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better services and products.

**How we collect personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you complete your business filing on-line through [www.delawareinc.com](http://www.delawareinc.com/), we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the Harvard website allow you to create an "Harvard ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name and email address—then choose a password for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Harvard ID. Next time you order something from Harvard, you can simply enter your email address and password—the system will automatically look up the information it needs.

**When we disclose personal information**  
Harvard works with other companies that help us provide Harvard products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only, and we require that the companies safeguard your personal information in accordance with Harvard's policies.

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.

**How we protect your personal information**  
Harvard safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

Harvard uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To place on-line orders with Harvard, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

**Collecting other personal information**  
When you browse Harvard’s website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.

Like many websites, the Harvard website uses “cookie” technology. When you first connect to our site, the [cookie](http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/aboutcookies.html) identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.

**Our companywide commitment to privacy**  
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Harvard employee. Harvard does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

Harvard's website contains links to other sites. Harvard does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.

 **Your Access to and Control Over Information  
** You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time.  However, keep in mind that this may jeopardize our ability to fulfill our statutory obligation to receive and forward documents to you as your registered agent.  In any event, you can do the following at any time by contacting us via [info@delawareinc.com](mailto:info@delawareinc.com) or 1-302-645-7400:

~ See what data we have about you, if any.  
~ Change/correct any date we have about you.  
~ Have us delete any data we have about you.  
~ Express any concern you have about our use of your data.

The Harvard Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.  **If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 1-302-645-7400 or via email at[info@delawareinc.com](mailto:info@delawareinc.com).**
