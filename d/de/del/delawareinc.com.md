# Our Privacy Policy - Incorporate your Delaware Corporation or LLC TODAY with Harvard Business Services

  
Protecting your privacy is important to Harvard Business Services, Inc. (Harvard). We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Harvard Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Why we collect personal information**  
Harvard collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to provide a range of additional services available to you. This may occasionally include information from other companies about products and services that can add value to your Harvard products. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in market research, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better services and products.

**Our Pledge to Protect Your Information & Data Security**  
We will NEVER sell, rent, lease, or share your personal information with any third party without your express permission. Our records are password protected by biometric finger print scanners and monitored by security personal that are on site. Your data is monitored by a 16 camera infrared system, backed up by independent propane power supplies, generators and a state of the art digitally controlled power management system. Your records are stored in secure facilities with 24 hour surveillance and in case of a regional disaster we can start servicing your requests within 48 hours at our location of choice. To learn more about how we protect your information please ask one of our team members to provide you with a more detailed explanation. 

**How we collect personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you complete your business filing on-line through [www.delawareinc.com](http://www.delawareinc.com/), we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the Harvard website allow you to create an "Harvard ID" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name and email address—then choose a password for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal Harvard ID. Next time you order something from Harvard, you can simply enter your email address and password—the system will automatically look up the information it needs and give you access to our MyControlDesk features.

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.

**How we protect your personal information**  
Harvard safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

Harvard uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To place on-line orders with Harvard, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

**Collecting other personal information**  
When you browse Harvard’s website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.

Like many websites, the Harvard website uses “cookie” technology. When you first connect to our site we identify your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.

**Our companywide commitment to privacy**  
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Harvard employee. Harvard does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

Harvard's website contains links to other sites. Harvard does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

The Harvard Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.  **If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you should contact us immediately via telephone at 1-302-645-7400 or via email at[info@delawareinc.com](mailto:info@delawareinc.com).**
