  * Like many websites, the Harvard website uses "cookie" technology. When you first connect to our site we identify your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you, except your first name so we can welcome you on your next visit. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.
  * Information about your internet connection, the equipment you use to access our Website, usage details and your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking). Please contact us if you wish to opt out of behavioral tracking.



We collect this information: 

  * Directly from you when you provide it to us.
  * Automatically as you navigate through the site. Information collected automatically may include usage details, IP addresses and information collected through cookies and other tracking technologies.



Harvard collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service when you form your company and every year thereafter until you close or cancel your company. 

As your Delaware Registered Agent we are required by law to maintain your "Contact Person's" address. We will use this information to inform you of future Delaware Franchise Tax due dates and offer to fulfill these services for you for a fee. We will inform you of annual Registered Agent fees due. We will send you any service of process packages we may receive as your agent. If courier fees are necessary to forward Service of Process we will charge a service fee.

It is your responsibility to notify us of any change in address information so we can send you tax compliance notices, registered agent invoices and service of process.

Communication with Harvard through our website is not intended to create an attorney-client relationship. Harvard Business Services, Inc. is not a law firm, and therefore any information transmitted to Harvard is not considered privileged client-attorney information.

  * For any other purpose disclosed by us when you provide the information.
  * To comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request.
  * To enforce or apply our [terms of use](https://www.delawareinc.com/terms-of-use) and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes.
  * If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of Harvard Business Services, Inc., our customers or others.

We do not give or sell your name, email address, address information or any other personal information to any third party for marketing purposes and will reveal such information ONLY if required by law to disclose such information and as otherwise described in this policy. 

Every effort to secure your data against criminal outside disclosure is being taken over the internet. Every name and address in our database is initially and periodically checked against the U.S. Treasury Department's SDN list.

We will NOT sell, rent, lease, or share your personal information with any third party without your express permission and as otherwise described in this privacy policy. 

Our records are password protected by biometric finger print scanners and monitored by security personal that are on site. Your data is monitored by a 16 camera infrared system, backed up by independent propane power supplies, generators and a state of the art digitally controlled power management system. Your records are stored in secure facilities with 24-hour surveillance and in case of a regional disaster we can start servicing your requests within 48 hours at our location of choice.

Harvard safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

Harvard uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To place on-line orders with Harvard, you must use an SSL-enabled browser. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Website, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. 

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to our Website. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Website.

You can send us an e-mail at [info@delawareinc.com](mailto:info@delawareinc.com) to request access to, correct or delete any personal information that you have provided to us. We cannot delete your personal information except by also deleting your user account. We may not accommodate a request to change information if we believe the change would violate any law or legal requirement or cause the information to be incorrect.

Proper access and use of information provided on the Website is governed by our [terms of use](https://www.delawareinc.com/terms-of-use). 

California Civil Code Section Â§ 1798.83 permits users of our Website that are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [info@delawareinc.com](mailto:info@delawareinc.com). 

It is our policy to post any changes we make to our privacy policy on this page with a notice that the privacy policy has been updated on the Website home page. If we make material changes to how we treat our users' personal information, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account or through a notice on the Website home page. The date the privacy policy was last revised is identified at the top of the page. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting our Website and this privacy policy to check for any changes.

To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every Harvard employee.
