This Privacy Policy will answer your questions about the kind of information we collect and how we use it. We have also included information on how to prevent your personal information from being collected or shared when you visit our web site, respond to our web-based advertisements, or send us e-mail. If we change or update our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here. 

If you have any further questions or comments, contact us by selecting the **E-Mail Us** link on the left. 

**What information do you gather and how do you use it?**   
We collect information about your visits, such as service provider, browser type, operating system, pages accessed on our web site and the date and time of access to optimize your user experience and enhance your time spent with us online. We also receive information telling us what site you came from. 

When you send us an e-mail by selecting the **E-Mail Us** link, we will retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, and our response in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also use this information to measure how effectively we address your concerns.

  * E-mail address 
  * Credit/Debit card number and expiration date 
  * Billing address 
  * Phone/fax number

We retain your flight information and account and bonus mile information. We may ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products, and contact preferences. This information may be combined with information about you which we gathered from other offline sources. We use the information to design offers customized to your interests. For example, you may receive a special offer for your most frequently traveled destinations. 

**Who do you share my personal information with?**   
We do not sell your name or other private profile information to third parties, and do not intend to do so in the future. We only share your information with our SkyMiles partners. 

We may share anonymous, aggregated information about all our users with third parties.

**How do I tell Delta that I don't want to be contacted for promotional purposes?**   
We only send promotional e-mail messages to you if you have voluntarily provided us with your e-mail address. Occasionally, a third party will act on Delta's behalf and send an e-mail message for Delta. This is done in a secured environment. You may request to be removed from Delta's e-mail subscription list or designate e-mail preferences by visiting our **E-mail Programs** page by selecting the link on the left.
