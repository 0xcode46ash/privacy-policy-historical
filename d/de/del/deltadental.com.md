**PRIVACY POLICY** Delta Dental appreciates your visit to our web site ("Site"). We want to make our visitors feel very comfortable in dealing with Delta Dental on the Internet. Therefore, we have developed the following policy regarding the privacy of those of you who visit our site.

Delta uses its best efforts to respect the privacy of its on-line visitors. In that regard, Delta Dental will obtain non-personal information from its on-line visitors. For instance, Delta Dental tracks the total number of visitors to its Site in aggregate.

Delta Dental only gathers personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, etc. when voluntarily submitted by a visitor.

That information allows us to respond to your information request. It is used by Delta Dental, or other entities affiliated with Delta Dental, solely for internal purposes and is not sold or transferred to third parties. Only visitors who request e-mail will receive e-mail. Delta Dental reserves the right to change its policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for changes.
