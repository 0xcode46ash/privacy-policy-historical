# Dell's Policies + Processes

Dell respects your privacy. Across our business, around the world, we will only collect, store and use your personal information for defined purposes. We use your information to support and enhance our relationship with you, for example, to process your purchase, provide service and support, and share product, service and company news and offerings with you. We do not sell your personal information. We only share your personal data outside the Dell family of companies with your consent, as required by law or to protect Dell, its customers, or the public, or with companies that help Dell fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Dell's commitment to protecting your privacy and data. At any time you may contact Dell with any privacy questions or concerns you may have. You also may ask at any time to see the data you have given us and request correction or deletion. We strive to ensure a high level of security and confidentiality.

At Dell, your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. That's why, whether you are purchasing a product or service from us or obtaining technical support, whether online or dealing with one of sales or technical support representatives over the phone, or simply visiting [dell.ca](http://www.dell.com/intl/ca/),.we strive to ensure that every customer experience is safe and secure. Dell has prepared this Privacy Policy to inform you about our ongoing commitment to ensuring your personal information remains accurate, confidential and used only for identified purposes, regardless of how it is provided to us. This Policy also addresses how you can inquire about the personal information we hold about you and how we will respond to such a request. 

Dell has certain specific guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site ( **www.dell.ca** ) or when you use our online support offerings such as **support.dell.ca** . Other Dell and Dell Co-branded sites may operate under their own privacy and security policies. For a summary of our corporate-wide privacy guidelines, see [_Michael Dell's public statement_](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/reftopic.aspx/gen/en/policy?c=ca&l=en&s=gen&~section=003). You can also visit www.nclnet.org/essentials to learn more about how to protect your privacy on the internet through a consumer education campaign called Online E-ssentials, developed by Dell in partnership with the National Consumers League.

When and Why Dell asks for specific types of personal information

In a few areas on our Web site and online customer support tools, as well as in our telephone interaction with customers, we ask you to provide information for a number of purposes including in order to enable us to proceed with processing and fulfilling your product or service purchase, to assist you with technical support issues, or to follow up with you after your product or service inquiry or purchase to obtain your feedback or to ensure that you are aware of Dell's product and service portfolio and any special offers or promotions we think may be of interest to you. In certain circumstances, it is completely optional for you to provide your personal information, and in other circumstances, such as in order to complete your purchase, such information must be provided. If you choose not to provide your personal information, we will advise you if a service cannot be performed without such information.

We request information from you when you:

Why We May Ask for Your Social Insurance Number

If your choice of payment for a Dell product is by way of leasing, we will ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN). This is requested so that we can provide your information to a credit bureau in order to perform a credit analysis. The SIN is the best way to ensure that the information we are provided actually refers to you. This will avoid us making incorrect conclusions about your financial status. However, you should be aware that using your SIN in this manner is voluntary and you have the right to refuse to provide it to us.

Dell only uses your personal information for specific purposes
