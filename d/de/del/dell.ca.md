The Privacy Statement applies to Dell Canada Inc., Dell Financial Services Canada Limited and their respective Canadian corporate affiliates* (collectively, "Dell", "we", "us" or "our"). This Privacy Statement does not apply to our Service Providers or to any other third parties, even if their websites are linked to our website. We recommend you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact with whom you interact.

Please refer to your warranty statements and Dell's Return Policy for policies that apply to information contained on hard drives returned to Dell.

Scope of this Privacy Statement

This Privacy Statement applies only to Personal Information collected from individual customers. It does not apply to corporate or business contact information. In addition, this Privacy Statement is not applicable to Personal Information that has been aggregated or made anonymous and no longer specifically relates to an identifiable individual. Dell reserves the right to use aggregated or anonymous information in any manner it considers appropriate.

Information We Collect

We may ask you to provide Personal Information when you 

  * Use our website;
  * Request quotes, services, support, or information;
  * Place orders for products or services;
  * Apply for credit, leasing or other financing products or services;
  * Participate in surveys, sweepstakes, or other promotional activities;
  * Subscribe to newsletters, promotional emails, or other materials;
  * Apply for a job, submit your resume/CV, or create a candidate profile; or
  * Contact us.



Information we may request includes your email address, name, home address, and telephone number. If you make a purchase, we may ask for your credit card number and billing information.

If you request credit, leasing, or other financing products or services, we may also ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN) and other data (including information regarding your income, assets, debts, liabilities, your banking information, and information regarding your financial and credit history) to process your credit, leasing, or financing request as permitted by law. We will ask for your Social Insurance Number (SIN) so that we can provide your information to a consumer or credit reporting agency in order to perform a credit analysis. The SIN is the best way to ensure that the information we are provided by the reporting agency actually refers to you. Providing your SIN assists us with accurate and timely processing of your application. However, providing your SIN is optional and choosing not to provide it will not prevent you from obtaining credit or other products or services from us. When you are a credit or leasing customer, we collect information about your transactions, including your purchases, account balances and payments.

Job applicants may be requested to provide information such as educational background, employment experience, job interest information, and criminal background checks. We may also collect demographic information, such as your business or company information, age, gender, interests, preferences and favourites. Forms that you fill in may indicate whether information requested is mandatory or voluntary for the purpose for which the information is requested.

We may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links and ads you click, search terms you enter, and other actions you take in connection with the Dell websites and services. We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Dell, information collected through one source may be combined with information obtained through other Dell resources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties. For example, Dell may collect data on which pages you visit on the website and later combine this information on purchases you complete on Dell.com. We may use the combined data to determine which ads to serve you on Dell.com or third party websites or to determine what ads to include in future emails sent to you.[Click here](https://web.archive.org/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/about_our_ads?c=ca&l=en&s=gen) to learn more about how we determine which ads to serve you.

Some Dell services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Dell and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services, and may use the information according to each company's privacy statement and other agreements with you.

How We Use Personal Information

Dell uses your personal information to: 

  * Deliver the services and support, or carry out, the transactions you have requested;
  * Determine your eligibility to receive credit, leasing, or other financing products or services, including obtaining reports from consumer or credit reporting agencies, financial institutions or finance companies;
  * Verify your identity and creditworthiness;
  * Send communications to you, such as product safety information, your transactions status (for example, order confirmations), information about products and services available from Dell and its corporate affiliates, promotional offers, and surveys;
  * Customize, analyze, and improve our products, services (including the content and advertisements on our website and in emails), technologies, communications and relationship with you;
  * Identify patterns of behaviour to offer relevant suggestions to users. For example, based on non-identifiable data collected through cookies on our website, we may be able to determine that users who viewed certain products may also like other specific products. These cookies are not tied to personal identifiers;
  * Enforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate agreements (if applicable) with you;
  * Manage, administer, collect and enforce accounts, collect debts, and process payments;
  * Meet our legal, regulatory, insurance and processing requirements;
  * Protect you and us from fraud, identity theft, unauthorized access to your account, and other prohibited or illegal activities;
  * Protect the security or integrity of the website, our business, or our products or services; or
  * Otherwise, as disclosed to you at the point of collection or as permitted or required by law.



Disclosing Personal Information

We may share your Personal Information with corporate affiliates to carry out transactions you request or to make our business or that of our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs. We may disclose your Personal Information to credit bureaus and credit reporting agencies and financial institutions and to other third parties as necessary to maintain your credit history, provide credit references, process payments, and otherwise manage our accounts and fulfill our legal and regulatory requirements.

We may also use your Personal Information and share your Personal Information among corporate affiliates and our authorized third party marketing and advertising agencies in order to communicate with you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you and to develop and implement customer programs, unless you opt out from this use.

We will not disclose your Personal Information to third parties for their own marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.

We may disclose and/or transfer Personal Information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of Dell Inc. or its corporate affiliates, or of any of the business or assets or shares of Dell Inc. or Dell Canada Inc. or their respective corporate affiliates, or divisions thereof in order for you to continue to receive products and services from the third party.

We may also disclose your Personal Information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; as required or permitted by law or regulation; or if Dell reasonably believes it is necessary to protect Dell, its customers, or the public.

We may transfer your Personal Information to Service Providers that help Dell carry out transactions you request, that help Dell promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us and/or our corporate affiliates, or that help Dell to customize, analyze, and/or improve our communication or relationship with you, and then only with Service Providers who share Dell's commitment to protecting your Personal Information. For example, Dell may use Service Providers to deliver email to Dell customers, may work with Service Providers to customize ads based on pages users visit on Dell.com (including Dell.ca), or may allow Service Providers to collect aggregate information to identify trends and analyze which pages are visited most often by visitors to Dell.com. Dell may disclose Personal Information to Service Providers to complete transactions or market on Dell's behalf, but those Service Providers are prohibited from using your Personal Information for their own purposes.

Some Service Providers are located outside of Canada, including in the United States. Likewise, some Dell facilities may also be located outside of Canada. As a result, your Personal Information may be collected, processed and stored in another jurisdiction. Reasonable contractual and other measures we may take to protect your Personal Information while processed or handled by these Service Providers are subject to legal requirements applicable to our Service Providers, for example lawful requirements to disclose Personal Information to government authorities in certain circumstances.

All such Service Providers are required to limit their use of your Personal Information for the purposes and in the manner we have instructed them. They have also committed to keeping your Personal Information confidential, using it only as directed by Dell, and to secure your Personal Information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. All Service Providers who receive information from Dell to use on Dell's behalf are obligated to manage the information under Dell's Privacy Statement.

Your Consent to the Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information

The provision of your Personal Information to Dell means that you agree and consent that we may collect, use and disclose your Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Statement. In addition, from time to time and where appropriate, Dell may request your specific authorization or consent for the collection, use and disclosure of your Personal Information for other purposes.

Subject to legal and contractual restrictions, you may withdraw your consent to our further collection, use or disclosure of information at any time by giving us reasonable notice. However, where we have provided or are providing certain services or products to you, including but not limited to credit, leasing or other financing products or services, your consent will be valid so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which the information was collected. In addition, you may not be permitted to withdraw your consent to certain necessary collection, uses and disclosures of your Personal Information (for example but not limited to maintaining reasonable business and transaction records, and the ongoing disclosure of your Personal Information to consumer or credit reporting agencies).

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, Dell may be required to disclose your Personal Information without your consent such as to law enforcement or other government officials. This could arise, for example, where disclosure is required:   


  * To comply with a subpoena, warrant or order made by a court with jurisdiction to compel the production of such information;
  * To legal authorities for the detection and prevention of fraud or other criminal activity; or
  * To our legal counsel in the event that any matter may the subject of litigation.



If Dell should be required to release your Personal Information without your consent, such as for the reasons listed above, we keep a record of what information was released, to which party it was released and why the circumstances necessitated such release. In order to respect your privacy to the fullest extent possible, Dell will only release the information to the extent that we are required to do so.

How We Secure Your Personal Information

Dell is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as encryption, passwords, physical security, etc. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, Dell cannot ensure or warrant that the Personal Information or private communications you transmit to us will always remain private, and you provide this information at your own risk.
