_ Privacy on the Internet_

**

_**Online Banking**_ – DECU uses a cryptographic (digital certificate) key to secure account information sent between our server and your browser. Whenever you use decuONLINE our server responds to your transmission by sending this key that is authenticated by your browser. This communication key encrypts the data sent by you and DECU decrypts it when we receive it. DECU uses firewalls that are designed to protect your accounts from unauthorized access from outside the credit union.

**_CheckFree Web BillPay_ **  – DECU maintains a vendor relationship with CheckFree Corporation to provide bill payment services for existing CheckFree participants.  CheckFree Corporation’s general policy on privacy states that account information is treated as confidential information. CheckFree Corporation’s policy provides that they will disclose information to third parties about your account or transfers you make ONLY in the following situations: (1) when it is necessary to complete a transfer, (2) to verify the existence and condition of your account to a third party, such as a credit bureau or merchant, (3) to a consumer reporting agency for research purposes only, (4) to comply with a court order or other legal requirements, or (5) when member permission is given to do so.

_** payONLINE **_ – DECU maintains vendor relationships with SourceLink and MasterCard International Incorporated for our primary bill payment service. SourceLink and MasterCard International Incorporated maintain strong confidentiality policies and limit the use of account information for the purposes of issuing checks or electronic transfer payments on behalf of member authorized transactions.

_**Other Links**_ \- For our members' convenience, links are available in this website to allow quick access to other sites that may be of interest. Clicking on a link will take you out of DECU's website to an alternative website not operated by DECU. The Credit Union is not responsible for the content of the third party website and does not represent either the third party website or the member if you enter into a transaction. The third party websites are not insured by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).  Privacy and security policies of the websites to which you are linking may differ from those practiced by DECU.

Exceptions to this policy may not be authorized by any DECU representative other than DECU’s President, Chairman of the Board of Directors, or Chairman of the Supervisory Committee.
