Deltastock will use the data collected from the client to establish their identity in accordance with the applicable law, as well as to enter into an agreement with the client for providing the services offered by the company. The data gathered will also be used to classify the client as a retail or unprofessional client – and with regard to this, to provide them with the legally established set of documents and other information, as well as to determine the client’s tax status for the purposes of the automatic exchange of financial information in the field of taxation.

Unless the client is informed otherwise, the non-public information and personal data that Deltastock holds and processes is also used for:

  * anyone authorised by the client, as specified by that individual or the contract.



### Access to Information

Any client, after submitting a written request, is entitled to access the personal data collected about them by Deltastock. In the cases where the right of access granted to an individual may also lead to disclosure of personal data of third parties, Deltastock is obligated to provide to the relevant client access only to the part of the data referring solely to them. When exercising their right of access, any client of Deltastock is entitled to request at any time:

  * a confirmation as to whether or not data relating to them is being processed, information as to the purposes of such processing, the categories of data concerned, and the recipients or categories of recipients to whom the data is disclosed;
  * a notification to the client, in an intelligible form, containing their personal data which is being processed, as well as any available information about their source;

Any client is entitled to require, at any time, from Deltastock to:

  * erase, rectify or block their personal data whose processing does not comply with the legal requirements;
  * notify any third parties to whom their personal data has been disclosed of any erasure, rectification, or blocking carried out in compliance with the previous item, unless this is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort.



Any client to whom the personal data refers is entitled to:

  * object before Deltastock against the processing of their personal data in the presence of legal grounds for that; when such an objection is justified, the personal data of the relevant client may no longer be processed;
  * object against the processing of their personal data for the purposes of direct marketing;
  * be informed before their personal data is disclosed for the first time to third parties or used on their behalf for the purposes of direct marketing, and to be given the opportunity to object to such disclosure or use.



If the client does not wish Deltastock to process their personal data, they should inform the company in writing. In that case, Deltastock may not be able to provide them with information about services and/or products requested by them, and also the products and services themselves; and with regard to this, Deltastock will have no liability to the client in respect of the same.
