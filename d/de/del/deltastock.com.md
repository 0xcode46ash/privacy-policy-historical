### Cookies and IP Addresses

To make using our website as straightforward as possible and to improve the services we offer to you, we use cookies and IP addresses.

Cookies are harmless text files that web servers can store on your computer's hard drive when you visit a site. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. There are two main types of cookies:

  * Transient (or per-session) cookies - these only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security;
  * Persistent (or permanent) cookies - these stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with an automatic deletion date to help ensure your hard drive doesn’t get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter your login information, so you don't need to remember membership details.



They help you do things online, like remembering login details, so you don’t have to re-enter them when revisiting a site.

We use cookies to:

  * Gather customer journey information across our sites;
  * Ensure your privacy in our secure sites;
  * Store login details for our secure sites;
  * Temporarily store details input into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations;
  * Store details of your marketing, product and business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites;
  * Evaluate our sites advertising and promotional effectiveness (we own the anonymous data collected, which is not shared with anyone).



We use both our own (first party) and partner companies’ (third party) cookies to support these activities.

We don’t use cookies to track people’s Internet usage after leaving our sites and we don’t store personal information in them others could read and understand. We will not sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.

### Services Requiring Enabled Cookies

Some of our services require cookies in your browser to view and use them and to protect your financial and personal information.

### Changing Your Cookie Settings

To enable or disable cookies, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).

Alternatively, an external resource is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies), providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them to suit your preferences.

Please note that should you choose to set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of this Site, for example, any online accounts you may hold.

### Secure Online Services

Any secure online services you subscribe to with us may use cookies to enable information about you and your preferences to be stored, and to prevent unauthorised access to your services and information. Cookies must usually be accepted in such circumstances. Without them we cannot ensure your information is secure (and people rejecting cookies can’t use the services).

### IP Address

An IP address is a unique number that identifies your computer while connected to the Internet. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. We also use IP addresses to analyse overall visitor behaviour and preferences on the Site.

### Protection of Information

Clients' personal information is kept secure and strictly confidential, and is accessed and used only by the employees who service the client's account.

Deltastock uses advanced security software and technology to ensure a safe and secure trading environment and to protect clients' non-public personal, financial and trading information.

### Opt-Out Procedure

It is Deltastock's policy not to disclose non-public client information to non-affiliated third parties. Under the Applicable Law, Deltastock is required to provide an opt-out procedure statement. You are not required to supply any of the personal information that Deltastock may request. However, failure to do so may result in the company's inability to open or maintain a client's account or to provide services to you.
