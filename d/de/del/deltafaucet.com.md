### Cookies and Similar Technologies

This Site uses cookies, which are small bits of data that a web server transfers to a computer for recordkeeping and other purposes. Cookies are an industry standard used by most websites to help facilitate users’ ongoing access to and use of a particular website. If you want to remove cookies from your computer at any time, you can delete or automatically decline them using your browser. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to use portions of the Site. 

The Site may use so-called “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) to, among other things, compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates.

We use the information received from these Pixel Tags in the aggregate for statistical analysis, among other things. 

Some uses of cookies and Pixel Tags in connection with the Site may be under the control of unaffiliated third-party entities that **Delta Faucet Company** retains to manage certain programs and fulfill specific visitor requests. **Delta Faucet Company** cannot be responsible for third-party uses of cookies and Pixel Tags. 

We treat information collected through the use of cookies and Pixel Tags as non-personal information.
