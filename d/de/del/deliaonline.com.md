This Act regulates the processing of information relating to individuals, including the holding, use or disclosure of such information. Our data is stored in a secure database protected by a number of access controls.

Data collected through the registration process or market research processes on the site will be used to improve the site, helping us to tailor our services to your needs.

We may use the information you provide when registering with Delia Online to communicate with you, but only if you have 'opted in' to receive our newsletter and/or third-party communications by email. These emails will include information from specially vetted companies who we feel may be able to supply you with products or services that add value to your experience with Delia Online. In these circumstances, any information you provide will be subject to the privacy policies of these companies. 

We also use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.co.uk/privacy_ads.html)

Google, as one of these third-party vendors, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google's use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on their visit to our site and other sites on the Internet.

Delia Online uses cookies in the operation of the site. These are small data files which store the information you provide us with and in doing so enable us to 'remember' the user on repeat visits and effectively let you move around the site without having to keep reintroducing yourself. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can set your browser to prevent this. If you choose not to accept our cookies, some services on our site will not be available (competitions, for example).

Should your personal information change, or you no longer require the services you have consented to, please e-mail us via [privacy@deliaonline.com](mailto:privacy@deliaonline.com) and we will ensure that your records are updated with immediate effect.

Delia Online reserves the right to share any information provided in response to a legal process, such as a court order or subpoena.
