# Deltek Privacy Statement

#### I. Purpose

Deltek and our subsidiaries and affiliates ("Deltek” or “we”) respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through compliance with this Privacy Statement and applicable law. This Privacy Statement covers the Personal Data collection, use, and disclosure practices of Deltek websites, products, and services that link to this Privacy Statement. “Personal Data” is information that identifies an individual or relates to an identifiable individual. Additional information on our Personal Data processing may be provided in notices at time of data collection.

This Privacy Statement does not cover Deltek’s Kona offering. Kona’s Privacy Policy may be found at [www.kona.com/privacy](https://www.kona.com/privacy "Kona.com").

  


#### II. Scope

This Privacy Statement does not cover data from which individual persons cannot be identified, or situations in which pseudonyms are used (the use of pseudonyms involves the replacement of names or other identifiers with substitutes, so that identification of individual persons is not possible).

Deltek does not knowingly collect Personal Data from children under the age of 13 (or as defined by local law) and does not target its websites, products, and services at children under those ages.

  


#### III. Collection and Use of Personal Data

Deltek may receive Personal Data: (1) directly from you, (2) from an affiliated company, or (3) through information that Deltek collects from third parties and as you navigate through a Deltek website or service, including usage details, IP addresses, and cookies. More information about Deltek’s use of cookies may be found in Deltek’s [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/en/legal/cookie-policy).

Deltek uses your Personal Data for business purposes, including without limitation: (1) creating an account; (2) order and service fulfillment; (3) customer service; (4) product improvement; (5) storing and processing data, including Personal Data, in computer databases and servers; (6) implementing and maintaining Deltek's information technology; (7) personalizing your experience; (8) marketing communications with you; and (9) for other business-related purposes permitted and/or required under applicable local law and regulation. If Deltek intends to use your Personal Data for any purpose not described in this Privacy Statement, Deltek will seek your prior consent.

  


#### IV. Disclosures/Onward Transfers of Personal Data

Deltek discloses your Personal Data to those who reasonably need to know such data for a legitimate business purpose and as required by law to Deltek subsidiaries, third parties, and business partners. By using Deltek websites, products, and solutions, or by providing your Personal Data to Deltek, you consent to the potential transfer, processing, and storage of such information outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different than your own.

Deltek requires our business partners, service vendors, authorized agents, and contractors to whom such disclosures are made to abide by confidentiality obligations. Absent your consent, Deltek will disclose your Personal Data only to service providers and their contractors who perform tasks on Deltek's behalf, provided that such service providers and/or contractors either: (a) comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield principles regarding the collection, use, sharing, and retention of personal information from the European Union or use another mechanism permitted by EU data protection laws and the applicable laws of other countries that impose international data transfer restrictions; or (b) agree to provide adequate protections for your privacy interests that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Statement and to use the Personal Data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by Deltek.

Previously, Deltek certified to compliance with the EU-US Safe Harbor framework and its principles regarding the collection, use, and retention of Personal Data from the EU. Deltek did not rely solely upon the Safe Harbor program for data transfers to comply with EU law. Following the European Court of Justice’s ruling on the validity of EU-US Safe Harbor program on October 6, 2015, Deltek has continued to comply with EU law for data transfers by participating, when required, in other approved data transfer programs.

Deltek will not sell or rent your Personal Data to anyone except as described above. Other than the disclosures described above, Deltek will disclose Personal Data only when required to do so by law or when Deltek believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Deltek, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a Deltek website or service and have supplied your email address, Deltek may, where permitted by law, occasionally contact you via email in order to discuss features, solicit your feedback, or update you on developments regarding Deltek and its products and services. If you send Deltek a request (e.g., via a support message or via one of our other feedback mechanisms), Deltek reserves the right to publish the request in order to help Deltek clarify or respond to your request or to help Deltek support other users. Deltek may disclose to third parties certain aggregated information collected about you and other users, but such information will not contain any personally identifiable information and your identity will remain anonymous.

Irrespective of which country you live in, you authorize Deltek to transfer, store, and use your information in the United States, Ireland, and any other country where we operate. In some of these countries, the privacy and data protection law and rules regarding when government authorities may access data may vary from those in the country where you live.

  


#### V. Sensitive Data

"Sensitive Data" is data that pertains to a person’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, income records, health, sexual orientation, or alleged commission of any offense. Deltek does not solicit Sensitive Data and, except as required by law, will not disclose Sensitive Data to any third party. Further, Deltek will not use your Sensitive Data for any purpose other than (1) for the purpose for which you originally provided it, (2) for a purpose you later expressly consented to, or (3) where necessary to fulfill Deltek’s legal obligations.

  


#### VI. Confidentiality and Security of Data

Deltek maintains reasonable physical, administrative, and technical safeguards designed to secure your Personal Data and Sensitive Data and prevent unauthorized access to such information.

#### VII. Right to Access, Change or Delete Data

Upon reasonable request and to the extent the request does not compromise the protections set forth in this Privacy Statement, Deltek permits reasonable access to Personal Data and Sensitive Data in order to correct, amend, or delete such data. You should direct any such request to [privacy@deltek.com](mailto:privacy@deltek.com?subject=Deltek%20Privacy).

Deltek will endeavor to respond in a timely manner to all reasonable written requests to view, modify, or delete Personal Data or Sensitive Data.
