**DELOITTE RESOURCES PRIVACY STATEMENT**

  
**Introduction**

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu is a privacy conscious global organization.  The following statement sets forth Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's privacy policy for its global intranet platform, Deloitte Resources, and the sites and applications hosted by this intranet platform (together ‘Deloitte Resources’). The privacy statement describes how Deloitte Resources collects and processes personal data.

Please note that Deloitte Resources also contains links to sites maintained and controlled by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu member firms and third party organizations that are not part of the Deloitte Resources platform. These sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You are responsible for familiarizing yourself with the privacy policies of any non-participating site you visit by clicking on a link provided by Deloitte Resources.

  
**Information Collection**

Deloitte Resources limits the information collected from partners, directors, employees and other authorized users to only the minimum information necessary to fulfill its function as a global resource for the Deloitte community.

  Users may provide a unique user name and password when logging in to Deloitte Resources.  Users can also complete  a  personal profile by providing business related personal information including, but not limited to, name, email address, business function, office location and telephone number. Users are informed that, if they wish, they may also submit information about their professional position and experience. The purpose of the personal profile is to have accurate and updated contact information on all users to facilitate the distribution of business updates and other materials. Platform sites may also collect contact information and other personal data such as your job title, professional skills and competencies, and resume data in order to fulfill their particular functions.

Where Deloitte Resources seeks non-mandatory information, you will be notified at the time the data is requested that such information is not required. If you, on your own, choose to submit personal information, you are consenting to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu's use of such data in accordance with this privacy statement.

Deloitte Resources does not usually seek any sensitive information (e.g., data relating to race or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental health, or sexual orientation) from users.  We will, where necessary, obtain your explicit consent to the collection and use of such information.

Deloitte Resources utilizes “cookies” to identify users when they connect to the site. A user’s browser must be enabled to allow cookies in order to access the site. Upon successful login a cookie is created and placed on the user’s machine. This cookie contains a 32bit GUID (Global Unique ID). This GUID is also stored in a table in a database to record once a user has been authenticated successfully. Other than the GUID URL, information may be stored in the cookie from time to time in order to redirect a user to the correct location. No personal information about the user is stored in the cookie.

In addition, to ensure that our global intranet platform is well managed and to facilitate improved navigation within the platform, we or our service provider(s) may use cookies or Web beacons (electronic images that allow Deloitte Resources to count users who have accessed a particular page or platform site, and to access certain cookies) to collect aggregate data. We may use such devices to track information on our systems and identify categories of users by items such as IP address, domain, browser type and URLs and pages visited. This information is reported to our Webmasters who use the information to analyze the number of users to different platform sites and areas to make sure that Deloitte Resources is serving as a useful, effective information source. Neither our cookies nor Web beacons collect any personal information such as your name or email address.

**Information Use**  
Deloitte Resources uses personal information for limited purposes only.  In general, personal information may be used to contact you with firm updates and other relevant information; to perform surveys of usefulness to Deloitte Resources; to create and maintain firm directories; to schedule client engagements and to facilitate communication within particular service lines or groups whose members are located in different jurisdictions.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

Although Deloitte Resources may provide users’ information to service providers that handle information on its behalf, information will usually not be shared with third parties or other Deloitte entities for secondary or unrelated purposes unless otherwise disclosed at the point of collection.

  Personal information may be transmitted internationally through the Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu worldwide organization or to third parties when necessary to achieve the purpose for which such information was submitted. This may include transfer to countries without data protection rules similar to those in effect in a particular user’s country of residence. By providing information to Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu through its global intranet platform, you are explicitly consenting to such transfers.

Where appropriate, personal information may be disclosed to law enforcement, regulatory or other government agencies or third parties where necessary or desirable to comply with legal or regulatory obligations or requests.

**Access to Information**  
Deloitte Resources is dedicated to providing you reasonable opportunity to access and review your retained personal information and correct any inaccuracies it may contain. You may choose to edit and update your personal Deloitte Resources profile at anytime. In all cases the Deloitte Resources sites will treat requests to access information or change information in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Information Security**

Deloitte Resources has in place reasonable commercial standards of technology and operational security to protect all information provided by users from loss, misuse, alteration or destruction.

  
**Changes to our Privacy Policy**

Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu reserves the right to modify or amend this privacy statement at any time and for any reason. Nothing contained herein is intended to create a contract or agreement between Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu and any user visiting Deloitte Resources or providing personal information of any kind.
