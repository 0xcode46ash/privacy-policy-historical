Delta Hotels Limited (“Delta”), the operator of this website, is committed to preserving the privacy of those who visit our website, make a reservation, stay at a Delta hotel or resort, become a member of our loyalty program or otherwise provide Delta with their Personal Information. This document, as our official Privacy Policy, will outline how we gather and utilize various sources of Personal Information obtained during your interaction with Delta and its hotels and resorts.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you what Personal Information we and our subsidiaries collect about you, how we use it and the circumstances under which we disclose it. We also provide you with information about how you can request access to your Personal Information and obtain more information about Delta’s privacy policies and procedures.

As detailed further below, Personal Information is used for purposes of confirming your reservations, responding to your questions and ensuring that our services are provided at the highest level, and meet applicable legal and compliance requirements.

Visiting sites linked from deltahotels.com is at your own risk.

 **What Personal Information Does Delta Collect and Why?**

Delta strives to collect only such Personal Information that is required for purposes of providing services individuals have requested, responding to questions and fulfilling its business and legal requirements.

Delta also collects Personal Information from individuals applying for employment and or franchise and hotel development opportunities. Please note that additional terms and policies will apply for employees, business associates, employment, hotel development and franchise applicants.

Some Delta services and programs are offered for Delta Privilege members or other registered participants only, including mobile applications and other programs. Completion of enrolment forms and other documents and acceptance of additional terms and conditions may be required by a program.

  * Non-personally identifiable information about you, such as usage of website, communication preferences, travel habits, aggregated data relative to stays and responses to promotional offers and surveys.



Some of the primary purposes for collecting your Personal Information are as follows:

  * Providing services such as processing a transaction (e.g., making a reservation, booking an event, fulfilling a request for information or completing a request for a particular service or product);

You may opt out of receiving marketing by mail or e-mail, and participating in Delta surveys, at any time by clicking on the link included in such communications, or by contacting us directly to opt out of direct marketing, telemarketing, e-mails or surveys. You will always be offered the choice not to submit your Personal Information or to decide what communications you want to receive from us. However, doing so may cause certain transactions to become affected. For example, not providing a name will prevent the processing of reservations.

 **Consent and Communications Preferences**

Providing your Personal Information, either in person, by telephone, by facsimile or on-line, constitutes your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of such Personal Information by Delta for the purpose of providing the relevant services in accordance with this Privacy Policy and with our statements provided to you at the time you provide information to us. We only collect information by lawful means.

If you have previously consented to having your Personal Information used for marketing purposes or market research, you may opt out of being contacted for these purposes and withdraw consent from having your Personal Information used for these purposes at the time you are asked to provide this information or any time thereafter. Newsletters, promotional material and e-mails will specify how you may opt out of being contacted. You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Delta by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive.

Depending on the respective service, you may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional e-mail, telephone calls and postal mail for Delta promotional offers.

We invite you to set your communications preferences for receiving promotional offers by visiting the following pages: <https://www.deltahotels.com/Pages/Email-Preference-Centre>

**Minors**

Delta does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive, Personal Information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our websites. If a minor (as defined by applicable law) provides us with his or her data without parental or guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from future Delta marketing communications.

 **When Does Delta Disclose Personal Information?**

Delta does not sell your Personal Information to third parties.

Delta may, on occasion, share some or all of your Personal Information with third parties for processing in accordance with the purposes for which it has been provided. These third parties are required to safeguard the data. For example, sharing may take place:

  * with Delta’s head office to meet legal and compliance requirements and meet our operational needs; 
  * to comply with legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law, a court order or a subpoena;
  * in case of emergency, such as to safeguard the life, health or property of an individual;
  * with third parties in connection with a business transaction, including a corporate re-organization, merger, acquisition, disposition, joint venture, affiliation or amalgamation, or the sale of all or some of our assets, provided that the Personal Information disclosed continues to be used for the purposes permitted by this Privacy Policy by the entity acquiring this information;
  * when a hotel or other property leaves the Delta system and access to your Personal Information is necessary to facilitate business operations or meet contractual obligations;
  * where you consent to the disclosure of your Personal Information;
  * in situations where sharing or disclosing your information is required in order to offer you products or services you desire (e.g., a vacation package); and
  * with companies or service providers and other third parties that perform business activities on behalf of Delta require such information (e.g., credit card processing, customer support services, market research administration or database administration, legal counsel, auditors, organizations that help us administer enrolment programs and compliance requirements, and companies that assist us with data storage and processing and marketing services).



If Personal Information is shared as mentioned above, we seek to limit the scope of information that is furnished to the amount necessary for the performance of the specific function. Unless otherwise precluded by legal process, we require third parties to protect your Personal Information and abide by applicable privacy laws and regulations.

Additionally, Delta may disclose your Personal Information where and when required or permitted by law to do so.

 **Processing and Storage of Information**

Some parties that process or store Personal Information for us may be located in the United States. Therefore, such Personal Information will be processed and stored in the United States and, as a result, the United States governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the United States.

 **Information Gathered with Technology**

If you are visiting our website, we use a feature called “cookies” which identifies your browser to us each time you visit and makes the website easier to view (e.g., establishes font size). We may also collect your IP address when you visit our website. Your IP address is collected so that we know how many visits to our website we have had. Our cookies cannot profile your system or collect information from your hard drive. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, but you can set your browsers to refuse or limit the use of cookies.

 **How Does Delta Protect the Personal Information It Collects?**

To protect information about you from loss, theft, unauthorized access and disclosure or use, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards and security measures in keeping with industry standards and practices. For example, all guest information is protected from unauthorized access through the use of secure passwords, user logons or other security procedures. Within Delta, we restrict access to information about you to those Delta employees who need to know the information in order to perform their jobs, such as confirming your reservation, responding to your concerns or notifying you about new or existing services. All Delta affiliates, suppliers, agents, employees and other parties performing services on our behalf who handle Personal Information are bound to maintain the confidentiality of all Personal Information and may not use the information for any unauthorized purpose. We regularly review and adjust these safeguards (including security and encryption methods) in response to advances in technology. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security all of the time.

 **Accuracy and Access**

We are committed to ensuring that the Personal Information we hold for each individual is accurate, up-to-date and complete. You have the right to access your Personal Information in our files and to update or remove that information as necessary, subject to any legal restrictions that would prohibit such action. To access your Personal Information, please contact our Privacy Officer by telephone, e-mail or post at the numbers and address provided below. Please be sure to specify what information requires updating or removal. In order to ensure that information we maintain on file, and if applicable, your Delta Privilege Profile, is up to date, we recommend that you access your on-line profile from time to time. You can do so by visiting our website and logging in to your account or contacting our customer service representative.

If, upon review, you wish to deactivate your Delta Privilege Profile, or update your Personal Information, we will endeavour to do so in a timely manner. Occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored on “back up” systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.

Delta may add, modify or remove portions of this Privacy Policy, as and when it deems necessary or appropriate. You will be able to determine when this Privacy Policy was most recently modified by referring to the “last update” date appearing at the end of this document.
