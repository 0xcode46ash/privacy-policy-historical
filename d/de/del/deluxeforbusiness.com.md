## Deluxe for Business Privacy Policy

Last updated March 5, 2010

Protecting privacy is an important part of the business of Deluxe For Business. Throughout our existence, we have been a trusted custodian of sensitive data. Our customers rely on that trust. Founded in 1915, we have a long history of recognizing and protecting the privacy of our customers' information. In 1997 we formalized our privacy policy to ensure that all customers understand our commitment to protecting their privacy. We are committed to utilizing technology that gives you the safest and most powerful online experience available. We want to assure you that when we ask for customer information, our goal is to improve our business customer relationships and provide solutions you need to grow your business.

Through this site, Deluxe For Business provides a variety of solutions to businesses large or small through multiple distribution channels. The Deluxe For Business solutions site enables the ordering of products and services that include personalized printed products and a large suite of business services, including logo design, payroll, web design and hosting, and other web-based services designed to help your business grow. The following statements will help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide through our Web sites. The terms "we", "our", and "us" in this Privacy statement refer to Deluxe For Business and its affiliates/subsidiaries of Deluxe Corporation.

### Information Collection & Use

We use the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, and future promotions. For the purposes of order verification and fraud prevention, we may exchange information about our customers internally within Deluxe For Business and among our affiliates. 

The type of information we collect, use, or share may depend on the product or service you have with us. At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply identifying information for purposes such as receiving correspondence, registering on this Web site, making purchases, or participating in online surveys, market research or contests/sweepstakes. If you elect to participate, we may require you to provide business information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, financial institution information, credit card information, or e-mail address. In certain areas of Deluxe for Business sites, you may provide employee information such as when adding additional authorized users to your business account and updating contact information. When you submit business information to us, you understand and agree that we may access, store, and use your information.

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we may send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. We may send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to deactivate your account. 

For testimonials, we do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting their name along with their testimonial. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit through testimonials.

Information you provide will be safeguarded according to our strict standards of security and confidentiality. Deluxe For Business recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of the information you choose to provide. We take steps to require that our vendors, consultants, suppliers, and contractors observe our Privacy Policy with respect to security and the collection, use, and exchange of our customers' information. They are expected to abide by our Privacy Policy when conducting work for us and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

### Information Sharing and Your Choices

Reasons we can share your information | Does Deluxe For Business Share? | Can you limit this sharing?   
---|---|---  
For our every day business purposes - including billing, processing transactions, & fulfilling orders; customer & marketing support services | Yes | No   
For our marketing purposes - to offer products and services to grow your business | Yes | Yes   
For our affiliated companies to market to you | Yes | Yes   
For third parties to market to you | Yes | Yes   
  
Deluxe For Business may selectively share customer information, including names and mailing addresses, with reputable third parties and organizations whose products and services we think may interest you if the customer information is independently obtained by us (that is, if the information is received from sources other than your financial institution). Names and other personal information that are received by us through a financial institution are not shared with third parties except for the purpose of fulfilling our contracts with financial institutions or as otherwise permitted by law.

We do not share your email address with third parties for them to market their products or services directly to you. However, we may partner with selected companies to offer certain products or services we believe may be of interest to you on their behalf.

We provide you with the opportunity to opt out of receiving unsolicited marketing as a result of your transaction with us or authorizing us to share your personal information with third parties and other organizations for marketing purposes. If you no longer wish to receive special offers or promotional communications from Deluxe or any third parties, you may edit your Account Profile or follow the unsubscribe instructions included in each communication. You may also express your opt-out choices by contacting Deluxe For Business customer service (contact information below).

We reserve the right to disclose information about you as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.
