  | This Web site is directed or intended for U.S. residents only. This privacy policy is effective August 21, 2005, and applies to all customer-identifiable information we obtain when a customer visits this Web site.

The following statements will help you understand how we collect, use, and safeguard the information you provide through our Web sites.  
  
  |    
  |  |   | Information Collection and Use  
---|---  
  | When you browse this Web site, you do so without revealing your identity. Personal information is not collected without your awareness. For each visitor to this Web site, our servers recognize the Web site you came from and the Web site you visit after you leave. In the order-capture process, we may track the order preferences of visitors to the Web site. We track order-preference information by using cookies.  
  |    
  | Cookies  
  | 

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your Web browser on your computer's hard drive. A cookie may contain information (such as a unique user session ID) that is used to track the pages of the Web sites you've visited. We use cookies, but we do not store personally identifiable information in your cookies. This Web site uses cookies to improve your shopping experience. The information stored in cookies helps us serve you better by keeping track of your order as you shop at our sites. This information also helps us improve our site design.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can set your browser to decline cookies. Even if your Web browser is set to decline cookies, you can use many of the features within this site. However, you will not be able to place an order or retrieve your order status.  
  
  |    
  | Disclosure of Individual Information  
  | 

We are committed to protecting your private information. We use the information collected about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience. We may also use your information to communicate with you about products, services, and future promotions. For the purposes of check verification and fraud prevention, we exchange information about our customers internally and among our affiliates.

Names and other information that are received by us through a financial institution are not shared with or rented to nonaffiliated third parties except for the purpose of fulfilling our contracts with financial institutions or as otherwise permitted by law.

We may selectively share customer information, including names and mailing addresses, with reputable third parties and organizations whose products and services we think may interest you if the customer information is independently obtained by us (that is, if the information is received from sources other than your financial institution).

If you do not want the information you provide us to be shared with nonaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes, or if you do not want to receive correspondence from us, you may opt out as described below.  
  
  |    
  | Personal Information You Choose to Provide  
  | At times, we may request that you voluntarily supply personal information for purposes such as receiving correspondence, registering on this Web site, making purchases, participating in online surveys, and receiving notice of employment opportunities. If you elect to participate, we may require you to provide personally identifiable information, including your name, mailing address, phone number, financial institution information, credit card information, or e-mail address. When you submit personal information to us, you understand and agree that we and our affiliates may access, store, and use your personal information. Information you provide will be safeguarded according to our strict standards of security and confidentiality.  
  |    
  | Security of Information  
  | Security measures are in place on this Web site to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We offer industry-standard security measures available through your Web browser. When you are on this Web site, the information you provide is encrypted and scrambled en route and decoded once it reaches us. Please remember that e-mail, which is different from the encrypted sessions above, is not secure. Therefore, we ask that you do not send confidential information such as social security or account numbers to us via an unsecured e-mail message. Send confidential information to us via U.S. mail or phone. 

We take steps to require that our vendors, consultants, suppliers, and contractors observe our Privacy Policy with respect to security and the collection, use, and exchange of our customers' information. They are expected to abide by the Privacy Policy when conducting work for us.  
  
  |

You can help us maintain accurate records by informing us of changes or modifications to your personal information using one of the methods listed under **Contacting Deluxe**. Our service representatives are trained to answer questions about and give you reasonable access to your personal information in our database.

  |    
  | Enforcement  
  | Periodically, our operations and business practices are reviewed for compliance with corporate policies and procedures governing the confidentiality of information. These reviews are conducted by internal staff, internal auditors who report directly to the Deluxe Board of Directors, external auditing and accounting firms, and government regulators. Included in these self-assessments and examinations are reviews of the controls and safeguards related to consumer privacy described in our Privacy Policy.  
  |
