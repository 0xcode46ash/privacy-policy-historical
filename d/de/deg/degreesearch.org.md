We collect various types of information from our visitors so we can adjust our site to meet our users’ needs and expectations. Some of this information is collected automatically through cookies and other information is collected when you register for any of our online services or when you request information from one of our partners.

The types of information your browser or Internet session automatically sends us each time you visit one of our sites, which we automatically collect and does not identify individual users, includes:

You can remove these cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site may be limited.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies, once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by DegreeSearch.org only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

## Web Beacons 

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personal information. 

## Information You Provide to Us

In addition to the information automatically collected by your browser, we also collect information that you provide to us when you request information about a particular school or educational program.

We collect this information that you provide, and may use it to make your future requests from our websites easier by pre-populating contact forms with the information that you have provided. We provide the contact information that you provide us to the marketing partner about which you requested information. Customer interest information is collected to determine what information the customer wishes to be sent.
