# Privacy & Cookies

DEGIRO respects and protects your privacy. You can visit this website anonymously. DEGIRO is not interested in names or other information revealing the identity of the visitors to this site. Information about you or your computer will only be registered with DEGIRO for technical reasons, or in connection with a customer. This is done with a cookie or other means.

## Cookies

_What is a cookie?_

Cookies are small files stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies ensure that your browser is recognized by DEGIRO's Web server.

_Why does DEGIRO use cookies and web bugs?_

Websites have no memory. A visitor who browses from page to page on the site is regarded as a new visitor each time. Cookies enable a website to recognize your browser. Web bugs behaves in much the same way as cookies.

_Are all cookies the same?_

No. There is a difference between cookies. A distinction is made between function, duration and who places the cookie.

_Function:_

A **technical cookie** is necessary for a website and specific functions to work (technically). For example, to create access to protected or secured parts of a website. Without this type of cookie, some services, such as a login, shopping cart and electronic payment will not work.

An **analysis cookie** collects information about how visitors use a website. For example, the page that is visited most and where any errors occur. The purpose of this type of cookie is to provide the website provider insight into how the site works and how it can be improved. This cookie thereby also contributes to the website's usability.

A **functional cookie** remembers the choices made by the user. It may be choices such as a username, currency, language or country. This means that a user does not need to specify their preferences again. The functional cookie thus also contributes to ease of use.

An **advertising cookie** is used to display advertisements that are targeted at visitors of the website to ensure that the same advertising does not appear every time, and to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns. These are usually placed by advertising networks with the consent of the administrator of the website. They record that a website is visited.

_Duration:_

A session cookie is installed on the visitor's computer and collects data as long as the visitor is actually on the website. When you close your browser, the cookie is removed.

A permanent cookie is installed on the visitor's computer in a fixed (longer) period.

_Parties:_

A first-party cookie (first party cookie) is a cookie that is connected to the website which the visitor is visiting at the time. It may be a cookie from DEGIRO placed when visiting www.degiro.nl or related subdomains.

A third-party cookie (third party cookie) is a cookie that is placed by a party other than DEGIRO (the provider of the visited website). For example, providers of advertisements and (external) providers of applications whose advertisements or applications are integrated in the visited website.

_What is a web bug?_

A web bug is an electronic image of a single pixel (1 x 1) or a so-called "colourless GIF" in the website's coding. Web bugs really function in the same way as cookies. Web bugs are used to follow the visitor traffic from one page to another, in order to optimize the flow of traffic on the website.

_What can I do if I do not want (certain) cookies?_

You can in your browser settings (eg. Internet Explorer, Safari, Firefox, Mozilla or Chrome) specify whether you allow cookies or not and which cookies to accept. The settings are different from browser to browser. You can obtain information about the location and method under the 'Help' on your browser.

You should be aware that you may not be able to use our website's functions properly if you refuse (certain) cookies.

If you do not wish to receive advertising cookies, you can activate the 'do not track' in your browser.
