**IP Address Logging**  
DealTime logs IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting so that we can update and improve the services we offer to you. We do not link IP addresses to any information that could personally identify you. This means that the path of your DealTime session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous. **Cookies**  
DealTime uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., stored searches). 

**User Information**  
The use of certain DealTime features requires that you supply personal information like your name, e-mail address and credit card number. At your direction, we may use this information to send you the results of product searches you create. This information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the “Choice/Opt-Out” section below). 

**Sharing Information**  
Unless you give explicit permission (e.g., you opt to receive e-mail from partners and third parties or you elect to make an online purchase through DealTime’s transaction facilitation tool), DealTime has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information (such as your e-mail address, credit card information, or mailing address), except when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights, safety or property of DealTime, our users, or others.

In certain specific areas of some co-branded sites, we advise you that data you provide to us (for example, when opening a DealTime Account or subscribing to our iDeals newsletter) may be required to be shared with our co-brand partner. We will always alert you to this **before** you give us information, so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed.

**Links to Other Sites**  
This site contains links to other Web sites. DealTime is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site’s own privacy policy. 

**Special Relationships**  
DealTime enters into special relationships, such as "Powered by" partners, affiliates and co-branded sites in order to offer a broader array of services and serve the most users. In these cases, all personal information is stored on the DealTime servers, and is not shared with these third parties. 

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
At any time, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from DealTime and our partners. You may opt-out during any sign-up process on our site, or at a later time should you decide to do so (send e-mail to remove@dealtime.com). 

You also have the ability to remove your information from our database and cancel future communications or DealTime services: 

  * Go to www.DealTime.com. Click the “Your Account” tab, and click on the “Delete” button for each product search to end any stored searches. 

Update Your Information You may easily modify the information you have previously provided to DealTime: 

Go to www.DealTime.com and click on the “Your Account” tab. Select the appropriate link in the “Alert Methods” and/or “Edit/Delete Search” columns to modify your previous choices.
