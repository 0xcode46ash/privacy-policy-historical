**Your Privacy**  
DealTime believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide to our customers. To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, DealTime makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the steps we take to make sure that when you use DealTime, you can focus on finding great deals in a safe, worry-free environment. Top of page

**Security**  
Using the latest security measures and technologies, we keep a tight watch on the information you give to DealTime to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control.

**IP Address Logging**  
DealTime logs IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting so that we can update and improve the services we offer to you. We do not link IP addresses to any information that could personally identify you. This means that the path of your DealTime session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous.

**Cookies**  
DealTime uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches).

**User Information**  
The use of certain DealTime features requires that you supply personal information like your name and e-mail address. This information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below).

**Sharing Information**  
Unless you give explicit permission (e.g., you opt to receive e-mail from partners and third parties), DealTime has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information (such as your e-mail address or mailing address), except when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights, safety or property of DealTime, our users, or others. 

In certain specific areas of some co-branded sites, we advise you that data you provide to us (for example, when subscribing to our e-mail newsletter) may be required to be shared with our co-brand partner. We will always alert you to this **before** you give us information, so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed. Top of page

**Links to Other Sites**  
This site contains links to other Web sites. DealTime is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.

**Special Relationships**  
DealTime enters into special relationships to offer a broader array of services to our users. On occasions when we partner with another service to bring you more comparison-shopping functionality, such as with our automobile category, we do not host these pages on our own servers. In these instances, information may be collected but it is being collected by the partner and not by DealTime. DealTime may receive information from these partners, only when it is clearly stated. Unless you give explicit permission, DealTime has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information and only aggregated (and not individual) data is used by DealTime.

**Tell a Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friendÂ’s name and email address. DealTime collects the email address of your friend for the sole purpose of automatically sending the friend an email inviting them to visit the site and does not store this information.
