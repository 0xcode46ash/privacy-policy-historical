# DealTime.co.uk: Price Comparison, Store & Product Reviews

**Privacy Policy** **Your Privacy**  
---  
Dealtime UK believes that trust is an important component of the service we provide to our customers. To ensure that we earn and keep that trust, Dealtime UK makes every effort to protect your privacy and the confidentiality of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the steps we take to make sure that when you use Dealtime UK, you can focus on finding great deals in a safe, worry-free environment.  
  
**Security**  
---  
Using the latest security measures and technologies, we keep a tight watch on the information you give to Dealtime UK to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data under our control.  
  
**IP Address Logging**  
---  
Dealtime UK logs IP addresses (your unique Internet address) for system administration purposes. IP addresses are logged to give us an idea of which parts of our site users are visiting so that we can update and improve the services we offer to you. We do not link IP addresses to any information that could personally identify you. This means that the path of your Dealtime UK session will be tracked, but you will remain anonymous.  
  
**Cookies**  
---  
Dealtime UK uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined search criteria and notification preferences whenever you visit our site. You can block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may prevent us from delivering certain services to you (e.g., saved searches).  
  
**User Information**  
---  
The use of certain Dealtime UK features requires that you supply personal information like your name and e-mail address. At your direction, we may use this information to send you our e-mail newsletter. This information may also be used to contact you when necessary. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings at any time (see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below).  
  
**Sharing Information**  
---  
In certain specific areas of some co-branded sites, we advise you that data you provide to us (for example, when subscribing to our email newsletter) may be required to be shared with our co-brand partner. We will always alert you to this before you give us information, so that you can make an informed decision about whether or not to proceed.

In addition, we may share data with any parent company, subsidiaries, JVs, other companies under a common control or acquirers. We expect these other companies will honor this statement. Also, we may allow a potential acquirer or merger partner to review our databases, although we would restrict their use and disclosure of this data during the diligence phase.

We may disclose data about you to the government if we are required to do so or if we think the disclosure is appropriate; and you authorize these disclosures. We may also disclose data about you in connection with actual or potential lawsuits (a) if we are required to do so, (b) if such disclosures may potentially mitigate our liability, or (c) to enforce our rights.  
  
  
**Links to Other Sites**  
---  
This site contains links to other Web sites. Dealtime UK is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site's own privacy policy.  
  
**Special Relationships**  
---  
Dealtime UK enters into special relationships to offer a broader array of services to our users. On occasions when we partner with another service to bring you more comparison-shopping functionality, such as with our automobile category, we do not host these pages on our own servers. In these instances, information may be collected but it is being collected by the partner and not by Dealtime UK. Dealtime UK may receive information from these partners, only when it is clearly stated. Unless you give explicit permission, Dealtime UK has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information and only aggregated (and not individual) data is used by Dealtime UK.  
  
**Choice/Opt-Out of Dealtime UK E-mail Communications**  
---  
At any time, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving communications from Dealtime UK and our partners. To unsubscribe from the Dealtime UK e-mail newsletter, contact [customersupport@shopping.com](mailto:customercare@dealtime.com) and let us know that you would like to discontinue this service.  
  
**Tell a Friend**  
---  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Shopping.com collects the email address of your friend for the sole purpose of automatically sending the friend an email inviting them to visit the site and does not store this information.  
  
**Advertising**  
---  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www2.doubleclick.com/emea/htm/privacy_policy.asp)
