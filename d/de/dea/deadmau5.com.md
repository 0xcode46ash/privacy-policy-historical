  * Third-party advertisers on the Website may use cookies and other technologies in their advertisements for statistical purposes; we have no control over cookies placed on the Website by third parties.


  * If you shorten EMI URLs, for example on Twitter or Facebook, and use the SmartURL service to do so, EMI works with SmartURL to rebrand some links e.g. a <http://kyl.ie/xxxxx> link. EMI web products or phone apps sometimes offer features that allow users to share links with social networks and EMI shortens that URL using the SmartURL service. Also EMI shortens links to online stores like the iTunes Music Store using the SmartURL service. SmartURL provides EMI with anonymised, aggregated statistics relating to use of a shortened EMI URL, for example by telling us how many times it has been clicked on. EMI does not have access to the IP address of your computer collected by SmartURL when you use its service or any other identifiable information about you. Nor does SmartURL have any access to data collected on an EMI website. For more information on SmartURL’s privacy policy, please see <http://manage.smarturl.it/mng/privacy>.
