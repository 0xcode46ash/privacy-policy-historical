# DealBase.com Privacy Policy

### Last updated: June 17, 2008

We know that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy. **By visiting dealbase.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy.**

### What Personal Information About Customers Does Dealbase.com Gather?

The information we learn from customers helps us personalize and continually improve your shopping experience at dealbase.com. Here are the types of information we gather. 

**Information You Give Us:** We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you might not be able to take advantage of many of our features. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, customizing future shopping for you, improving our stores, and communicating with you. 

**Automatic Information:** We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. For example, like many websites, we use “cookies,” and we obtain certain types of information when your web browser accesses dealbase.com. A number of companies offer utilities designed to help you visit websites anonymously. Although we will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience at dealbase.com if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these tools exist. 

**E-mail Communications:** To help us make e-mails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from dealbase.com if your computer supports such capabilities. We also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your customer communication preferences on our website. 

**Information from Other Sources:** We might receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. 

### What About Cookies? 

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to provide features such as our pre-populated check out and payment form for return customers and storage of items in your electronic shopping basket between visits. 

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of dealbase.com’s coolest features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on. 

### Does Dealbase.com Share the Information It Receives?

Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we are not in the business of selling it to others. We share customer information only as described below and with subsidiaries DealBase controls that either are subject to this Privacy Policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Policy. 

**Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:** We work closely with our affiliated businesses. In some cases these businesses operate stores at dealbase.com or sell offerings to you at dealbase.com. In other cases, we operate stores, provide services, or sell product lines jointly with these businesses. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share customer information related to those transactions with that third party. 

**Agents:** We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. We share customer information with these agents as we deem necessary for them to perform their functions. 

**Promotional Offers:** We may enter into alliances, partnerships or other business arrangements with third parties who may be given access to personal information including your name, address, telephone number and email for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think may be of interest to you. In connection with such business arrangements with third parties we may also share other customer information with third parties who will use it for promotional offers if we have determined that the information will be used in a responsible manner by a responsible third party. In addition, we may also use the information we collect to notify you about important changes to our web site, new services and special offers we think you will find valuable. If you do not want to receive such offers, please adjust your customer communication preferences on our website. 

**Business Transfers:** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy stores, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Policy (unless, of course, the customer consents otherwise). Also, in the event that DealBase, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

**Protection of DealBase and Others:** We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use Agreement and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of DealBase, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

**With Your Consent:** Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. 

### How Secure Is Information About Me? 

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. 

We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing. 

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Click here for more information on how to sign off. 

### Which Information Can I Access?

dealbase.com gives you access to a broad range of information about your account and your interactions with dealbase.com for the limited purpose of viewing and, in certain cases, updating that information. Click here to see some examples, the list of which will change as our website evolves. 

### What Choices Do I Have? 

As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase or to take advantage of such dealbase.com features as wish lists, and customer reviews. 

You can add or update certain information on pages such as those listed in the “Which Information Can I Access?” section above. When you update information, we usually keep a copy of the prior version for our records. 

If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please adjust your customer communication preferences on our website. (If you do not want to receive our Terms of Use Agreement and other legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those notices will still govern your use of dealbase.com, and it is your responsibility to review them for changes.) 

The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use such important features as our pre-populated check out and payment form for return customers and storage of items in your electronic shopping basket between visits if you do not use cookies.

### Children

### Safe Harbor

dealbase.com is a participant in the Safe Harbor program developed by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the European Union.

### Conditions of Use, Notices, and Revisions 

If you choose to visit dealbase.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use Agreement, including limitations on damages, arbitration of disputes, and application of the law of the State of California. If you have any concern about privacy at dealbase.com, please contact us with a thorough description, and we will try to resolve it. 

Our business changes constantly, and our Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement will change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our website frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We stand behind the promises we make, however, and will never materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of customer information collected in the past without the consent of affected customers.

### Information You Give Us 

You provide most such information when you search, buy, bid, post, participate in a contest or questionnaire, or communicate with customer service. For example, you provide information when you search for a product; place an order through dealbase.com or one of our third-party sellers; provide information in your account (and you might have more than one if you have used more than one e-mail address when shopping with us) or about you; communicate with us by phone, e-mail, or otherwise; complete a questionnaire or a contest entry form; compile wish lists or other gift registries; provide employer information when opening a corporate account; participate in discussion boards or chat rooms; provide and rate reviews; specify a special occasion reminder; and employ other personal notification services, such as notifications of product availability. As a result of those actions, you might supply us with such information as your name, address, and phone numbers; credit card information; people to whom purchases have been shipped, including addresses and phone number; content of reviews and e-mails to us; personal description and photographs in our section that is personalized about you; and financial information, including Social Security and driver’s license numbers. 

### Automatic Information 

Examples of the information we collect and analyze include the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; login; e-mail address; password; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; purchase history, which we sometimes aggregate with similar information from other customers to create features; the full Uniform Resource Locator (URL) clickstream to, through, and from our website, including date and time; cookie number; products you viewed or searched for; pages you visited; your purchase history; and the phone number you used to call our 800 number. During some visits we may use software tools such as JavaScript to measure and collect session information, including page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to browse away from the page.

### Information from Other Sources 

Examples of information we receive from other sources include updated delivery and address information from our carriers or other third parties, which we use to correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily; account information, purchase or redemption information, and page-view information from some merchants with which we operate co-branded businesses or for which we provide technical, fulfillment, advertising, or other services; search term and search result information from some searches conducted through the web search features offered on our website; search results and links, including paid listings; and credit history information from credit bureaus, which we use to help prevent and detect fraud and to offer certain credit or financial services to some customers. 

### Information You Can Access
