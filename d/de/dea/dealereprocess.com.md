## Information regarding Dealer EProcess's privacy practices:

This document describes Dealer EProcess's policy regarding standard information collected in normal web site usage as well as information you provide when you visit our web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site.

  


## Normal Web Site Usage:

During normal web site usage, we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, or social security number. You can visit Dealer E Process's web site to read product, company, and other information. The only information we collect and store during normal web site usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the web site you last visited, the pages you request, and the date and time of those requests. We collect this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. This information is shared only within Dealer EProcess.

  


## Collection of Personal Information:

At times, particularly when you use one of our on-line services (i.e., new-car buying, used-car buying, Dealer EProcess's on-line credit application, etc.) Dealer EProcess may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to fill out any one of these forms. If you choose to use one of these on-line services, however, Dealer EProcess may require that you provide information, which may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, social security number or other personally identifying information. When you submit personal information to Dealer EProcess, you understand and agree that Dealer EProcess may access, store, and utilize your customer profile information. We may share information about your personal information with reputable credit reporting agencies as authorized under federal and state laws, but only as lawfully permitted or required. We collect this information for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to informing you of special offers, and other products and services from Dealer E Process.

While we have not done so at this time, in the future we may contract with other reputable companies in our efforts to offer you additional attractive products and services. If you do not want the information you provide to Dealer EProcess to be shared with other companies, please indicate this preference when you provide the information to Dealer E Process in the comments section. Of course, we will honor your request .

Dealer EProcess's privacy practices are designed to provide a high level of protection for your personal information and our computer systems.

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy. A revised Privacy Policy will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 10 days prior to its effective date.
