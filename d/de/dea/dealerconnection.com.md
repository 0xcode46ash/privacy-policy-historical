**Information Regarding Ford Motor Company's Privacy Practices:**

This document describes Ford Motor Company's (and its divisions: Ford Credit, Ford Division and Lincoln/Mercury Division here after referred to as Ford) policy regarding information received about you during visits to our web site. The amount and type of information received depends on how you use our site. 

**

Normal Web Site Usage:

**

You can visit Ford's web site to read product, company and investment information or use our on-line tools (Build Your Own, budget planner, calculators, etc.) without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect and store during normal web site usage is the name of your Internet service provider, the web site that referred you to us, the pages you request and the date and time of those requests. We use this information to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of customer visits. During normal web site usage we do not collect or store personally identifiable information such as name, mailing address, email address, phone number or social security number. 

**

Collection of personally identifiable information:

**

There are instances where Ford requests personally identifiable information to provide the web site visitor a service or correspondence (promotions and mailed brochures). This information, such as name, mailing address, email address, type of request and possibly additional information, is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data by Ford and is used to fulfill your request. If you tell us that the information should not be used as a basis for further contact, we will respect your request. The information you provide is used by Ford to improve the services we provide you. It is never provided to any other company for that company's independent use. 

**

Ford's internet services:

**

To use Ford's Internet Services, such as Account Access, Electronic Funds Transfer Enrollment, literature requests, etc., we require a certain amount of personally identifying information (examples are: name, social security number, account number, vehicle identification number, zip code, personal identification number, business name, tax identification, etc.) that we can use to verify you as a Ford Customer (or to meet with your request). We use this information to identify and access data in the existing relationship we have with you to provide you with the requested services. We request electronic mail addresses (email) as an alternate means of contacting you. Providing your email address is optional. 

**

Electronic Mail sent to us that contains personal information:

**

Internet users may decide to send Ford personally identifying information, for example, in a message containing information about your Ford or Ford Credit product or service. Ford will only use this information to identify the user as a Ford customer and to determine how to respond to the electronic mail. We will not use this information other than to resolve the matter identified in the email. We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy. A revised Privacy Policy will only apply to data collected subsequent to its effective date. Any revisions will be posted at least 10 days prior to its effective date.
