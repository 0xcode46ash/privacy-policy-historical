Privacy

  


### Introduction

DEALS.COM.AU Pty Ltd and its related entities (collectively, "DEALS.COM.AU" or "we") are committed to complying with its obligations under the Privacy Act 1988 Cth ("Privacy Act") and the Spam Act 2003 Cth ("Spam Act"). Capitalised terms in this Policy have the meaning given to them in the Privacy Act or the Spam Act (as the case may be). 

### Collection of Personal Information

DEALS.COM.AU only collects your Personal Information with the consent of the member (referred to in this Policy as "you"). Collection is done through the registration process when you are requested to provide information that identifies you. This information includes (but is not necessarily limited to): your first name, your last name and your email address. DEALS.COM.AU will only collect your Personal Information from you (i.e. not from any other person or source), by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way. 

### Use of Personal Information

Your Personal Information is used by DEALS.COM.AU for the purpose of promoting daily DEALS.COM.AU to you ("the Primary Purpose"). DEALS.COM.AU may use your Personal Information for a purpose related to the Primary Purpose ("the Secondary Purpose") provided that we (acting reasonably) believe:

      • that the purpose is directly related to the Primary Purpose of collection; AND

      • that you would reasonably expect us to use or disclose the information for the Secondary Purpose.

### Disclosure of Information

DEALS.COM.AU will only disclose your Personal Information to a third party:

      • if we are required, by law, to make the disclosure; or

      • if we believe, acting reasonably, that we are entitled to disclose the Personal Information under any disclosure exemption outlined in National Privacy Principle 2 of the Privacy Act

If you purchase a daily deal, you are issued with a unique voucher number which is also supplied to the merchant on whose behalf the deal is advertised ("the merchant"). We do not disclose your Personal Information to the merchant (although you may be requested to do so when you redeem the relevant voucher). 

DEALS.COM.AU DOES NOT disclose your Personal Information to any unrelated party for the purposes of direct marketing
