Using Information from Infozeal Websites: You may use personal information gathered from Infozeal websites only to follow up with another user about a specific posting, not to send spam or collect personal information from someone who hasn't agreed to that.

Security & Disclosure   
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All member data and activity is stored separately and is not directly accessible through a web browser. We use industry standard procedures and processes to safeguard the confidentiality of your identifiable personal information, such as firewalls, encryption, token authentication, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our network and its data. Unfortunately, when you submit information about yourself to Infozeal over the Internet, the information may travel over many systems that are not under the control of Infozeal. The Internet is not 100% secure and others might intercept the information that you are sending. Remember that your account is accessible only through the use of your Password.  
  
Who will have access to my personal information?  
  
Our priority is to keep your personal information private and confidential. Infozeal will not willfully disclose, rent, or sell your personal information to third parties. However, certain personal information will be available to others in the process of using Infozeal. For example, visitors to to Adsglobe.com, one of Infozeal's services, may view your sign-in name, feedback rating, city, and items you have for sale  
  
Of course, once you provide personal information to a user, Infozeal has no control over how that information might be used by that individual. In addition, should you circumvent our on-site messaging system (where applicable); Infozeal will be unable to provide assistance in any disputes.  
  
Infozeal may choose to disclose your personally identifiable information to others under the following circumstances:  
  
You consent to share your information.  
  
  * In response to a criminal investigation, subpoena, court order or legal process.
  * Your actions on Infozeal appear to be in violation of our policies (including, but not limited to, our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/terms_conditions.do)).
  * You post a classified ad which we believe, in our sole discretion, may create a liability for Infozeal.
  * Nothing in this policy shall limit, prohibit, or otherwise deny the ability of Infozeal to (1) transfer, assign, or sell our assets to a third party without limitation, or (2) dispose of our assets in any manner, through bankruptcy or similar proceeding.
