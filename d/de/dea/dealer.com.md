**Guiding Principles:**

Dealer.com respects the privacy of individuals who visit our Web sites, send us e-mail, or participate in features/services we offer online. Accordingly, our policy regarding online privacy has been developed using the following guiding principles:

Dealer.com collects information online primarily to provide our visitors with a more relevant experience on our sites. When doing so, we will make every reasonable effort to avoid excessive or irrelevant collection of data. Dealer.com will take reasonable physical, electronic and managerial measures to safeguard and secure any information you provide to us (e.g. data will be stored in protected databases on secured servers with restricted access). Dealer.com will not share any information you’ve provided to us with anyone without your consent other than to provide the service you’ve requested.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Data:**

Anytime you visit our Web site, we may gather certain non-personally identifiable information regarding the means you use to access our site. This information may include the type and version of your browser, your service provider, your IP address, any search engine you may have used to locate the site, and navigational information about where you go on our Web sites. We use this information to better serve you, help diagnose problems with our server, administer the Web site, and compile broad statistical data. If we associate non-personally identifiable information with personally identifiable information, we will consider that combination of data as personally identifiable and treat it in the ways described within this privacy policy.

**Information Voluntarily Provided:**

Any information you provide to us (such as your name, e-mail address, phone number and company) when you register for an event, “Contact Us,” request newsletters, information, or use any of the other interactive portions of our Web sites, is securely maintained. This information may be used to provide you with information you’ve requested about our company, our products and our services, or to provide you with special notices. You may opt out of receiving future communications at any time (see opt-out procedures below). This data may also be used to tailor your experience on our sites by providing content that is relevant to your interests and geographic region.

**Disclosure of Personal Information:**

Dealer.com understands the importance of your privacy. We collect and maintain the personal information for our use and our subsidiaries. We do not sell, rent, or trade consumer information to third parties, other than as described below.

Business Partners:

Dealer.com may partner with select retailers and other companies at various times to provide expanded services to our site visitors. As part of such a relationship, we may share with these companies the use of certain interactive Web site functions (e.g., when registering for events). Information provided by site visitors through the use of such interactive functions may be available to both Dealer.com and our partners. In addition, note that such third parties may provide access to additional privacy policies related to the service, which should be reviewed by you.

Service Providers:

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as submitting email communications to you on our behalf. These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary_ to provide these services to us.

Business Transfers:

In the event that Dealer.com sells or transfers a particular portion of its business assets, user information may be one of the business assets transferred as part of the transaction. If substantially all of the assets of Dealer.com are acquired, user information may be transferred as part of the acquisition.

Compliance with Law/Safety:

Dealer.com may disclose specific personal information based on a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to comply with or conform to the law or that such disclosure is necessary to protect the users of our Web sites, the sites themselves, or the public.

**Use of Cookies and Other Technologies:**

Dealer.com, and its third party analytics partners, may use a browser feature known as a “cookie.” Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing you with a customized browsing experience. Dealer.com uses cookies to provide you with the convenience of not having to reenter information, such as your contact details, multiple times during your visits to our Web sites. Cookies can also be utilized to help us provide you with information targeted to your interests, based upon your prior browsing on our Web sites. The “help” section of the toolbar on most browsers will inform you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you upon the receipt of a new cookie, or how to disable the use of cookies completely. As our Web sites have been designed to take advantage of the use of cookies, should you configure your browser to decline their use, certain features of our Web sites may not function correctly and you may be required to reenter information more frequently.

Web Beacons / Gifs:

Our third party web analytics partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The information gathered by clear gifs is not tied to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

Flash LSOs:

We use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to assist us with the display of video content on our site.  Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored.  Cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies.  To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click here:
