# Privacy Policy | DesignMyNight

We provide an annual check with our lawyers to ensure we are monitoring and keeping our data protection obligations up to date and reviewing our privacy policy below.

We are also members of the information commissioner's office.

This privacy policy applies to all users of the website [www.designmynight.com](http://www.designmynight.com/) (the “Website”).

DesignMyNight ("DMN") promises to serve its audience with integrity and honesty. DMN has developed this privacy policy to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy and to disclose our information-gathering and -sharing practices for the Website. By visiting the Website, you are accepting the practices described in this privacy policy. Our Website will develop and evolve over time, and this policy may change to reflect that.

**The DMN privacy promise:** We are absolutely committed to protecting your privacy. We are also committed to the following: (1) We will not pass on any individual user details unless we have your prior consent; and (2) if we don't have your consent to pass on individual user details, we will only give advertisers aggregate statistics about the number of users and their traffic patterns. However, if the ownership of DMN changes, DMN reserves the right to transfer all information collected through this Website to the new owner.

**Cookies:**  A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. We may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file. They help us to improve the Website and to deliver a better and more personalised service. They enable us:

  * to estimate our audience size and usage pattern;

  * to store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customise the Website according to your individual interests;

  * to speed up your searches; and

  * to recognise you when you return to the Website.




We use the following cookies:

  * Strictly necessary cookies. These are cookies that are required for the operation of our Website. They include, for example, cookies that enable you to log into secure areas of our Website.

  * Analytical/performance cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our Website when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our Website works, for example, by ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.

  * Functionality cookies. These are used to recognise you when you return to our Website. This enables us to personalise our content for you, greet you by name and remember your preferences (for example, your choice of language or region).

  * Targeting cookies. These cookies record your visit to our Website, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information to make our Website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.




Our Website contains links to other sites that are not under our control, even though some of them may feature the DMN logo through a marketing agreement with us. DMN cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of other companies. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site you visit on the Internet.

**DMN e-mail policy:** When you give us your e-mail address, you are also asked to let us know how we can use it: You can opt to allow us to e-mail you regarding your subscription, or to allow us to send you additional information via e-mail that we believe will be of interest to you. Such requests will be opt-in only, so that you do not inadvertently agree to receive mailings you do not want. If we ever request that you volunteer additional information, such as financial data or age (in an online survey, for example) your response will always be voluntary. In addition, there will always be a box for you to check if you choose to enable us to disclose such information to a third party. Users may opt to receive a regular e-mail newsletter that contains information we believe to be of value to our users, specifically special discounts and offers selected by our marketing department.

**Third-party disclosure of personal information:** we may disclose information to third parties, if we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of DMN, our customers, users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**Security:** DMN has invested, and will continue to invest, in the best-quality security available to guard access to information, data quality, and physical security of servers where information is stored. Our site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any transmission is at your own risk. 

**Accessing your personal information:** If you wish to review any personal information that DMN maintains about you, please mail your request and a self-addressed, stamped envelope to: Privacy Request, WFL Media, 4th Floor, 86-90 Paul Street, London, EC2A 4NE

**Collection of personal data from children:** Our site is not directed to users under the age of 18. DMN will not knowingly collect information from individuals under the age of 18 or provide any personally identifying information collected from children, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. No information collected through the site from users self-identified as children will knowingly be used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside DMN.

**DMN's right to change privacy policy:** Any changes we may make to our privacy policy in the future will be posted on this page and, where appropriate, notified to you by e-mail. Please check back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.
