# Privacy | Desire2Learn

#### What We Do with Your Information

When you provide information, that information may reside on our or our service providers' systems.

In addition to providing you the services or products that you have requested, we collect and use your information to operate and improve Desire2Learn offerings and Desire2Learn Web sites. These uses include providing you with more effective customer service; making offerings easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving Desire2Learn offerings and technologies and Desire2Learn Web sites; and displaying content and advertising that are customized to your interests and preferences.

Some Desire2Learn offerings are accompanied by interactive features such as chat rooms, forums, messaging and other ways to share. If you are an enterprise user, permissions as to what features are enabled and who has access to those features is determined by your Organization. We have no control over those decisions. If you are a consumer user, it is your choice whether to use the available functionality.

Information collected through Desire2Learn offerings and Desire2Learn Web sites may be stored and processed by us, our affiliates or our service providers in Canada, the United States or Australia; the laws of the jurisdiction in which the information is stored and processed will apply to its storage and processing.

If you submit information through a Desire2Learn Web site, personal information you submit may be used to provide the services or products that you requested, and may also be used for related activities. Related activities may include sharing your information to sales or marketing personnel who may contact you with further information that may be of interest to you.

When you receive newsletters or promotional emails from us, we may use web beacons, customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the email has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information.

##### If you are an enterprise user:

Information collected through the use of our support service is intended to help resolve issues as quickly as possible, and to ensure that you can be notified of the progress of any issues that you describe.

Your Organization may use information that it has collected through the use of Desire2Learn offerings in a manner that is different from what is set out in this Privacy Statement. Any use of your information by your Organization is subject to the privacy policies of your Organization and is beyond our control.

##### If you are a consumer user:

We may use your information to communicate with you. We may send certain service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Desire2Learn offerings may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may also send you promotional information to inform you of other Desire2Learn offerings and promotions.

#### Communications We Send

We may communicate with you through email or other means available through a Desire2Learn offering. We may send emails that help inform you about features of Desire2Learn offerings and we may also send you service messages related to the function of Desire2Learn offerings. We may send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners.

If you sign up for webinars, product trials, newsletters, our annual FUSION users' conference, contests or other marketing initiatives through the Desire2Learn Web sites, employees of Desire2Learn may contact you with information about Desire2Learn offerings and promotions that may be of interest to you.

#### Sharing Your Information with Third Parties

We may share your information with third parties who are not our partners or service providers only in the following situations:

  * We have your consent through an opt-in option provided to you; or
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of your personal information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable terms and conditions of this Privacy Statement or any applicable user agreement, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of us, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.



Except as part of the sale of all or substantially all of our assets, we will not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties who are not our partners or service providers unless we have your consent.

#### Information You Share With Other Users

Desire2Learn offerings may enable you to share information with or send communications to other users or the general public. You (or, if you are an enterprise user, your Organization) may select the other users with whom you share or to whom you send this information. Once you share information with or send information to other users, however, those other users may share your information at their discretion.

If you join a Desire2Learn community, other members of that Desire2Learn community can view your profile information once you provide it.
