**1\. We take privacy seriously**

The protection of your privacy when processing personal data is important to us. By default, when you visit our website, our web servers store the IP address of your Internet service provider, the website from which you visit us, the websites you visit, the date and duration of the visit. This information is mandatory for the technical transfer of websites and secure server operation. A personalized evaluation of this data does not take place.

If you send us data via contact form, this data will be stored in the course of the backup on our servers. Your data will only be used by us to process your request. Your data will be treated confidentially. A passing on to third parties does not take place.

Responsible body:

Email: [info@designhotels.com](mailto:info@designhotels.com)

**2\. Personal data**

Personal data is data about you. This data includes your name, address and email address. You do not have to expose any personal information in order to visit our website. In some cases we need your name and address as well as further information to offer you the desired service.

The same applies in the event that we supply you with information material on request or if we answer your inquiries. In these cases we will always point this out to you. In addition, we only store the data that you have sent to us automatically or voluntarily.

When you use one of our services, we usually only collect the data necessary to provide our service. We may ask you for more information, which is voluntary in nature. Whenever we process personal information, we do so to provide you with our service or to pursue our commercial goals.

**3\. What purposes do we use personal data for and how long do we store it?**

**3.1 Automatically processed data when you visit our website**

When you visit our website, we store certain information for administrative and technical reasons. These are: type and version of the browser used, date and time of access, as well as the IP address.

This data is anonymised and used only for statistical purposes or to improve our internet and online services.  
This anonymized data is stored separately from personal data on secure systems and can not be assigned to individual persons. This means that your personal information remains protected at all times.

**3.2 DESIGN HOTELS™ COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP**

You can register an account for the Design Hotels™ Community which will provide you various benefits. In this context and for your registration of such an account we will process personal data under a contract. The data will be stored until you or we terminate the account. When you register for such an account we will initially ask for your email address, to which a welcome email is sent to verify said email address and activate the account; after activation you are able to log in and provide further personal data voluntarily under “profile settings”. If you provide additional voluntary personal data, it will be used to prefill the personal details form upon making a booking, and/or be used to provide you with more refined topics in our communications, should you have opted in to any of our newsletters.

**3.3 Hotel Bookings**

If you make a booking via Design Hotels™, personal data such as full name, address and credit card details are required in order to process the booking(s) – required data is explicitly indicated during the booking process. We will process such data under the contract we enter with you. Obligatory and additional voluntarily submitted data – the extent of which can be extracted from the personal information form – is transferred to the respective member hotel for the arrangement of the contractual relationship. With each booking on designhotels.com the indicated email address will be automatically registered with an account that stores the booking, as well as the given email address, full name and address provided during the booking. In order to access the account it must be activated by following the instructions of the welcome email (see paragraph above, “DESIGN HOTELS™ COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP”).

When making a booking with Design Hotels™, as part of our contract with you, the required data needed to fulfill the accommodation contract is forwarded by Design Hotels™ to the individual contract partners, i.e. the member hotel(s). Your bookings will be recorded for the purpose of making the specific information accessible to you and the statistic information available to Design Hotels™.

**3.4 Newsletter**

With your prior consent we send you newsletters for a term until you opt out or we terminate sending newsletters to you. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you a newsletter by e-mail if you have previously explicitly confirmed to us that we should activate your account, where you can set the newsletter preferences. We will then send you a notification e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive our newsletter by clicking on a link in this e-mail. When you sign up for our newsletter, we store your IP address and the date of registration. This storage alone serves as proof in the event that a third party misuses your e-mail address without your knowledge or your authorization to sign up for the newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from us later, you can object to them at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.

**3.5 Cookies and similar technologies**

When you visit our website, we may store information on your computer in the form of cookies. Cookies are small files that are transferred from an Internet server to your browser and stored on its hard disk. Only the Internet Protocol address is stored here - no personal data. This information, which is stored in the cookies, allows us to automatically recognize you the next time you visit our website, which will facilitate your use of the same. For some of the purposes described in this section 3.4, we may also use similar technologies. The legal basis for the use of cookies and alternative technoloies is the legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f DSGVO, namely that we understand and improve the user experience on our websites so that we can serve the users’ needs.

Of course, you can also visit our website without accepting cookies. If you do not want your computer to be recognized the next time you visit, you may also decline to use cookies by changing the settings in your browser to "decline cookies". The respective procedure can be found in the operating instructions of your respective browser. If you refuse the use of cookies, however, it may lead to restrictions in the use of some areas of our websites.

**Auto Log in**  
If you choose to stay logged in on our website, we will store your login information in a cookie on your computer so that you do not have to authenticate upon return to our website but will be automatically logged in ("auto log in"). The cookie and thereby the auto log in expires automatically after 60 days.

**Adform**  
We use technology of ADFORM (Hovedvagtsgade 6, 1103 Kopenhagen, Danmark). In this context a cookie is stored on your computer as part of so called conversion tracking, if you have clicked on an ad from us or have accessed our website through an ad. This allows us to analyze the bahaviour of users on our website, that have accessed our website through ads, in order to adapt our ads and the website to user needs. You will find more information about adform and can opt out from the collection of data by Adform at: <http://site.adform.com/privacy-policy/en/>.

**Google Tag Manager**  
This website uses Google Tag Manager. The Tag Manager does not collect personal information. The tool triggers other tags, which may collect data. Google Tag Manager does not access this data. If disabled at the domain or cookie level, it will remain in effect for all tracking tags implemented with Google Tag Manager. The privacy policy of Google for this tool can be found here: <https://www.google.de/tagmanager/use-policy.html>.  
Google is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE)). The certification can be viewed at [https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active](https://www.privacyshield.gov/participant?id=a2zt000000001L5AAI&status=Active).

**Google Analytics with anonymization function**  
We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043 USA, hereafter "Google". Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files that are stored on your computer and thereby allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.

The information generated by these cookies, such as the time, location and frequency of your website visit, including your IP address, is transmitted to Google in the United States and stored there.

We use Google Analytics on our website with the addition "_gat._anonymizeIp". In this case, your IP address will already be shortened and thus anonymised by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.  
Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our site, to compile reports on our website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or as far as third parties process this data on behalf of Google.  
Google does not claim to link your IP address to any other data provided by Google. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to fully use all functions of our website. In addition, Google offers a deactivation add-on for the most popular browsers, giving you more control over what Google collects about the sites you visit. The add-on informs the JavaScript (ga.js) of Google Analytics that no website visit information should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics Disable Add-on does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or any other web analytics services we may use. Further information on installing the browser add-on is available via the following link: [https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en).

If you visit our site through a mobile device (smartphone or tablet), you must instead click this link, to prevent the tracking by Google Analytics within this website in the future. This is also possible as an alternative to the above browser add-on. Clicking on the link places an opt-out cookie in your browser that is valid only for this browser and this domain. If you delete the cookies in this browser, the opt-out cookie will also be deleted, so you will have to click the link again.

If you've consented to Google linking your web and app browsing history to your Google Account and using information from your Google Account to personalize your ads, Google will use your data with Google Analytics data to provide audience lists to create cross-device remarketing. To do this, Google Analytics will initially track your Google-authenticated ID associated with your Google Account (that is, personally identifiable information) on our website. Afterwards, Google Analytics will temporarily link your ID with your Google Analytics data to optimize our audiences.

If you do not agree, you can opt-out of this through the "My Account" section of your Google Account.  
Google is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE)).

**Google Remarketing  **  
This website uses the Google Inc. Remarketing feature (1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA; "Google"). The feature is designed to present interest-based ads to web page visitors within the Google Network. The technology allows us to post automatically generated, targeted ads after you visit our website. The advertisements are based on the products and services you clicked on the last visit to our website. For this purpose, a so-called "cookie" is stored in the browser of the website visitor, which makes it possible to recognize the visitor when he calls web pages belonging to the advertising network of Google. Cookies are small text files that are stored in your browser when you visit our website. Google usually stores information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. This information is used to associate the web browser with a particular computer. On the pages of the Google Network, advertisers can then be presented with ads related to content that the visitor previously viewed on web pages that use Google's remarketing feature.  
If you visited <https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated> you agree to linking your browsing history of Google with your Google Account, and information from your Google Account is used for ad personalization, as well as the remarketing feature across devices. Google collects your Google ID and uses it for cross-device discovery.  
According to Google's own account, Google does not collect any personal data during this process. However, if you do not wish to use Google Remarketing, you can disable it by clicking OPT-OUT here.  
You can also prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website in full.  
You can read more about how Google uses cookies in Google's Privacy Policy.  
Google is Privacy Shield certified and thus an adequate level of protection exists according to the Implementing Decision of the Commission (EU) 2016/1250 ([http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/DE/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016D1250&from=DE)).

**Google SiteSearch (Google AJAX Search API)**  
On our site, Java Script Code is downloaded from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheater Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA. If you have activated JavaScript in your browser and have not installed a Java Script Blocker, your browser may transfer personal data to Google. We do not know what data Google associates with the data received and why Google uses that information. To prevent the execution of Java script code by Google as a whole, you can install a java script blocker (e.g. [www.noscript.net](https://noscript.net/)). For details, see the privacy policy of the provider:  
<https://www.google.com/intl/de_de/policies/privacy/> or use your right to object by using the opt-out function here.
