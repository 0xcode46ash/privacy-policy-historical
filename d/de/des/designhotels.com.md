**4\. Contact**

You do not have to expose any personal information in order to visit our website, except your IP address. In some cases we need your name and address as well as further information to offer you the desired service.

The same applies in the event that we supply you with information material on request or if we answer your inquiries. In these cases we will always point this out to you. In addition, we only store the data that you have sent to us automatically or voluntarily.

When you use one of our services, we usually only collect the data necessary to provide our service. We may ask you for more information, which is voluntary in nature. Whenever we process personal information, we do so to provide you with our service or to pursue our commercial goals.

The legal basis is Art. 13 para 1 lit (a) or (b) GDPR.

**5\. For what purposes do we use personal data and on which legal basis do we process?**

**5.1 Mandatory data**

If you want to make a booking through our site or if you want to apply with us, you have to provide certain data within the scope of the contract to be concluded. In any other context, the provision of personal data is neither required by law nor by contract, nor are you required to provide personal information. However, the provision of personal data for the use of our services may also be partially required within the services we provide. In other words, if you do not provide us with the information, we specify to be necessary, we may not be able to provide you with the full scope of services. When you visit our website, we store certain information for administrative and technical reasons.

**5.2  DESIGN HOTELS™ COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP**

You can register an account for the Design Hotels™ Community which will provide you various benefits. In this context and for your registration of such an account we will process personal data under a contract. The legal basis is Art. 13 para 1 lit. (b) GDPR. Our purpose is to fulfil this contract. When you register for such an account we will initially ask for your email address, to which a welcome email is sent to verify said email address and activate the account; after activation you are able to log in and provide further personal data voluntarily under “profile settings”. If you provide additional voluntary personal data, it will be used to prefill the personal details form upon making a booking, and/or be used to provide you with more refined topics in our communications, should you have opted in to any of our newsletters.

**5.3 Hotel Bookings**

If you make a booking via Design Hotels™, personal data such as full name, address and credit card details are required in order to process the booking(s) – required data is explicitly indicated during the booking process. We will process such data under the contract we enter with you. Obligatory and additional voluntarily submitted data – the extent of which can be extracted from the personal information form – is transferred to the respective member hotel for the arrangement of the contractual relationship. With each booking on designhotels.com the indicated email address will be automatically registered with an account that stores the booking, as well as the given email address, full name and address provided during the booking. In order to access the account, it must be activated by following the instructions of the welcome email (see paragraph above, “DESIGN HOTELS™ COMMUNITY MEMBERSHIP”). Our purpose is to fulfil this contract. The legal basis is Art. 13 para 1 lit. (b) GDPR.

When making a booking with Design Hotels™, as part of our contract with you, the required data needed to fulfil the accommodation contract is forwarded by Design Hotels™ to the individual contract partners, i.e. the member hotel(s). Your bookings will be recorded for the purpose of making the specific information accessible to you and the statistic information available to Design Hotels™. The processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests. Our interest is to provide relevant offers to our Community and to improve the user experience on Designhotels.com.

**5.4 Newsletter**

With your prior consent we send you newsletters for a term until you opt out or we terminate sending newsletters to you. We use the so-called double opt-in procedure, which means that we will only send you a newsletter by e-mail if you have previously explicitly confirmed to us that we should activate your account, where you can set the newsletter preferences. We will then send you a notification e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to receive our newsletter by clicking on a link in this e-mail. When you sign up for our newsletter, we store your IP address and the date of registration. This storage alone serves as proof in the event that a third party misuses your e-mail address without your knowledge or your authorization to sign up for the newsletter. The purpose of newsletter send-outs is to inform Community members about updates and relevant offers. The legal basis is your consent, Art. 13 para 1 lit. (a) GDPR.

If we have obtained your email address from you in connection with the sale of goods or services, we may, under a legitimate interest based on Art. 6 para 1 lit. f) GDPR, promote our services and therefore use your email address to send you newsletters to advertise own similar goods or services if you have not objected to such use.

If you no longer wish to receive newsletters from us later, you can object to them at any time without incurring any costs other than the transmission costs according to the basic rates.

**5.5 Website technologies and tracking**

For some of the purposes described in this section, we use tracking technologies. The legal basis for the use of cookies and alternative technologies is the legitimate interest pursuant to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR, namely that we understand and improve the user experience on our websites so that we can serve the users’ interests.

Of course, you can also visit our website without accepting cookies. If you do not want your computer to be recognized the next time you visit, you may also decline to use cookies by changing the settings in your browser to "decline cookies". The respective procedure can be found in the operating instructions of your respective browser.

The cookie and thereby the auto log in expires automatically after 60 days.

**5.5.3 Adform**

We use technology of ADFORM (Hovedvagtsgade 6, 1103 Kopenhagen, Danmark). In this context a cookie is stored on your computer as part of so called conversion tracking, if you have clicked on an ad from or have accessed our website through an ad.

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Hereby cookies are stored on your computer and thereby allow an analysis of the use of the website by you.

We use Google Analytics on our website with the addition "_gat. anonymizeIp". In this case, your IP address will already be shortened and thus anonymised by Google within member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the Agreement on the European Economic Area.  
Google will use this information to evaluate your use of our site, to compile reports on our website activity, and to provide other services related to website activity and internet usage. Google may also transfer this information to third parties if required by law or as far as third parties process this data on behalf of Google.  
Google does not claim to link your IP address to any other data provided by Google. You can prevent the installation of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to fully use all functions of our website. In addition, Google offers a deactivation add-on for the most popular browsers, giving you more control over what Google collects about the sites you visit. The add-on informs the JavaScript (ga.js) of Google Analytics that no website visit information should be transmitted to Google Analytics. However, the Google Analytics Disable Add-on does not prevent information from being transmitted to us or any other web analytics services we may use. Further information on installing the browser add-on is available via the following link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

If you've consented to Google linking your web and app browsing history to your Google Account and using information from your Google Account to personalize your ads, Google will use your data with Google Analytics data to provide audience lists to create cross-device remarketing. To do this, Google Analytics will initially track your Google-authenticated ID associated with your Google Account (that is, personally identifiable information) on our website. Afterwards, Google Analytics will temporarily link your ID with your Google Analytics data to optimize our audiences.

If you do not agree, you can opt-out of this through the "My Account" section of your Google Account.

**5.5.4.3 Google Remarketing**

This website uses the Google Remarketing feature. The feature is designed to present interest-based ads to web page visitors within the Google Network. The technology allows us to post automatically generated, targeted ads after you visit our website. The advertisements are based on the products and services you clicked on the last visit to our website. For this purpose, a cookie is stored in the browser of the website visitor, which makes it possible to recognize the visitor when he calls web pages belonging to the advertising network of Google. Google usually stores information such as your web request, IP address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. This information is used to associate the web browser with a particular computer. On the pages of the Google Network, advertisers can then be presented with ads related to content that the visitor previously viewed on web pages that use Google's remarketing feature.  
If you visited https://www.google.com/settings/u/0/ads/authenticated you agree to linking your browsing history of Google with your Google Account, and information from your Google Account is used for ad personalization, as well as the remarketing feature across devices. Google collects your Google ID and uses it for cross-device discovery.  
According to Google's own account, Google does not collect any personal data during this process. However, if you do not wish to use Google Remarketing, you can disable it by following Google ads settings here: https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.  
You can also prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly; however, we point out that in this case you may not be able to use all functions of this website in full.

On our site, Java Script Code is downloaded from Google. If you have activated JavaScript in your browser and have not installed a Java Script Blocker, your browser may transfer personal data to Google. We do not know what data Google associates with the data received and why Google uses that information. To prevent the execution of Java script code by Google as a whole, you can install a java script blocker (e.g. www.noscript.net).
