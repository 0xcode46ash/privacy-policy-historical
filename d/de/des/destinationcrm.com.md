With the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our web site as described below, none of these methods can personally identify you. A cookie is an element of data that a web site such as destinationCRM can send to your browser, which then you may or may not choose to store it on your system. It is used to provide you with a tailored user experience.

Some destinationCRM pages use cookies. Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on destinationCRM's sites. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to reenter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your city so that next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. We treat any personally identifiable information with the same confidentiality as when you purchase something on our Web site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept or reject it.

destinationCRM does not require that you accept cookies. **
