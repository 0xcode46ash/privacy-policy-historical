# Privacy Policy: The Dessy Group

Your privacy is important to us. To explain how we respect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

The privacy policy below discloses The Dessy Group's practices regarding information collection and use solely for the web site located at www.dessy.com (the "Web site").

By using or accessing or using the Web site, you signify your agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY YOU MAY NOT ACCESS OR OTHERWISE USE THE SERVICE.

## Personally Identifiable Information that we collect:

We do not collect personally identifiable information from you on the Web site unless you voluntarily provide it to us, such as by ordering a product, inquiring about a product, registering to use a particular service or otherwise choosing to share your personally identifiable information with us. The personally identifiable information which you may provide to us could include your name, email address, physical address and payment information.

## Non-personal or Aggregate Information that we collect:

When you access our Web site, we may automatically collect non-personally identifiable information from you, such as referring web site, IP address, web pages viewed, browser type, usage and browsing habits on the Web site and similar data. We may also aggregate demographic information collected from our users (such as the number of users in a particular State) in a manner which does not identify any one individual.

## Information Usage:

We will only use your personally identifiable information as described below, unless you have specifically consented to another type of use, either at the time the personally identifiable information is collected from you or through some other form of consent from you:

  * We will use personally identifiable information to complete any orders you have placed.
  * We will use personally identifiable information to provide you with the specific services that you have requested, such as to reach a retailer.
  * We will use your personally identifiable information to respond to questions that you send to us.
  * We will use your personally identifiable information to send you emails from time to time, such as newsletters and notices about our promotions.
  * We may permit our vendors and subcontractors to access your personally identifiable information, but they are only permitted to do so in connection with performing services for us. They are not authorized by us to use the information for their own benefit. For instance, we may share your personally identifiable information with a credit card processing company or shipping provider to process orders that you have placed.
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process.
  * We may disclose personally identifiable information to investigate suspected fraud, harassment or other violations of any law, rule or regulation, or the terms or policies for the Web site.
  * We may transfer your personally identifiable information in connection with the sale or merger of The Dessy Group or the division responsible for the services with which your personally identifiable information is associated.



Non-personal or aggregate information may be shared with any number of parties, provided that such information shall not specifically identify you.

We may receive data from other sources outside of your use of the Web site and combine that information with data collected from the Web site. When we do so, we will use the combined information as set forth in this privacy policy.

## Cookies:

"Cookies" are pieces of information that may be placed on your computer by a web site for the purpose of facilitating and enhancing your communication and interaction with that web site. Many web sites use cookies for these purposes. We may use cookies (and similar items such as clear gifs, web beacons, tags, etc.) to customize your visit to the Web site and for other purposes to make your visit more convenient or to enable us to enhance our service. In addition, our advertisers and business partners may set cookies and similar items on your computer when you use our Web site. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, in which case you may still use our Web site, but it may interfere with some of its functionality. Cookies and similar items are not used by us to automatically retrieve personal information from your computer without your knowledge.

## Security:

The security of your Personal Information is very important to us. We attempt to provide for the secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers by utilizing encryption software. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and The Dessy Group or information stored on the Web site or our servers, will be free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers and your use of the Web site demonstrates your assumption of this risk. We have put in place reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Only those employees who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are authorized to have access to your Personal Information. For more information on protecting your privacy, please visit www.ftc.gov/privacy.

## Your disclosures in publicly assessable forums:

You should be aware that personally identifiable information which you voluntarily include and transmit online in a publicly assessable blog, chat room, social media platform or otherwise online may be viewed and used by others without any restrictions. We are unable to control such uses of your personally identifiable information, and by using such services you assume the risk that the personally identifiable information provided by you may be viewed and used by third parties for any number of purposes.

## Protection for Children

We have no intention of collecting personal information from children under the age of 13. When we become aware that personal information from a child under 13 has been collected without such child's parent or guardian's consent, we will use all reasonable efforts to delete such information from our database.

## Other Web Sites:

**As a convenience to you, we may provide links to third-party web sites from within the Web site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of these third-party sites. When you link away from our Web site, you do so at your own risk.**

## Communications with The Dessy Group:

By providing your email address to us, you expressly consent to receive emails from us. We may use email to communicate with you, to send information that you have requested or to send information about other products or services developed or provided by us, provided that, we will not give your email address to another party to promote their products or services directly to you without your consent.

You expressly agree that we are free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques contained in any communication you send to us without compensation and for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to, developing, manufacturing and marketing products and services using such information.

## Changes to policy:

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions from this policy at any time. However, if at any time in the future we plan to use personally identifiable information in a way that materially differs from this policy, we will post such changes here and provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such differing uses. Your continued use of the Web site following the posting of any changes to this policy means you accept such changes.

## Opt-Out Process:

All unsubscribe or opt-out requests should be sent to us at [support@dessy.com](mailto:support@dessy.com) and we will process your request within a reasonable time after receipt. However, we are not responsible for removing your personally identifiable information from the lists of any third party who has previously been provided your information in accordance with this policy or your consent.
