# Privacy | Descrier news and culture magazine

User privacy is of paramount importance to The Descrier. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding The Descrier’s commitment to protect the privacy of users and ensure the integrity of the Internet.

### Information Collected In Advertisement Delivery

In the course of delivering an ad to you, The Descrier does not collect any personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. We, however, use a number of different adserving solutions including Doubleclick and OpenX to collect non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. The non-personally identifiable information collected by The Descrier is for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of The Descrier’s advertisers and Web publishers.
