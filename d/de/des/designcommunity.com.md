**Privacy Policy**

Artifice, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [www.DesignCommunity.com](http://www.designcommunity.com/). 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. 

This site contains links to other sites. **www.DesignCommunity.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

We belong to the [24/7 Media Network](http://www.247media.com/), one of the largest advertising networks on the Internet. This network uses its own ad serving system, 24/7 Connect, to display [ads on this site](http://www.designcommunity.com/advertising.html). Ads may contain cookies, and appear to be coming from our site, but in reality they are coming from our partners who are serving ads on our site. 

Our web site uses cookies only to maintain your preferences settings, so when you revisit the site you will not have to reset certain options. The preferences are stored in the cookie on your computer, and no individual identifying or demographic information is stored in these preferences cookies. We do not have access to any information about you from cookies you might receive while visiting our site, and we do not provide third parties with any special information about your visit, including keywords, subject areas, zip codes or area codes. 

_Use of Cookies in 24/7 Connect_

The 24/7 Connect advertsing delivery system uses a feature of your browser to set a "cookie" on your computer. This allows us to measure and report aggregate information to advertisers such as the number of people who see their ad (reach) and the number of times people see their ad (frequency). It also allows us to deliver ads that are more relevant to you and avoid delivering the same ads too many times. 

Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. 24/7 Connect will only store information provided voluntarily, but this information is not personally identifiable. If for some reason you would rather not take advantage of the benefits made possible with cookies, most browsers allow you to reject cookies or to choose which cookies to accept. 

_24/7 Connect's Use of IP Addresses_

24/7 Connect delivers Internet advertisements for 24/7 Media Web sites. In the process of delivering ads 24/7 Connect recognizes the URL and category of the active Web Page, information about your computer, such as the browser, operating system and IP address, and the home server from which you access the Internet. 

Information regarding visitors to 24/7 Media sites is aggregated for the purposes of reporting to advertisers, ad sales organizations and the Web sites. Information about specific visitors is not made available to any of these organizations. 

**Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

Internet connection information about specific visitors, including IP numbers, may be communicated to outside parties as we deem necessary in actions to stop abuse of these forums. 

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Site logs are maintained in secure server areas accessible only to specially qualified technical staff.
