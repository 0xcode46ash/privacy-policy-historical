# Designers Guild :: Privacy Policy

**The Information We Need and How We Use It**  
The Information We Need and How We Use It When you order, we will require your name, e-mail address, credit / debit card number and card expiry date. Without this information we will not be able to process your request or notify you of acceptance of your order. 

A contact telephone number may also be required so that we may contact your urgently if there is a problem with your order. We may, unless you advise us otherwise, pass this information to our couriers or other agents in case they need to contact you to arrange the processing or delivery of your order. 

When you register with us you can select whether you would like to be sent notification of special orders, promotions and other correspondence from us via email. If you would like to receive these notifications please select the tick box on the registration form which is on the Order Confirmation page. If you leave the box unchecked you will not receive these notifications. If, in the past, you have chosen to be notified and you no longer wish to receive mailings from us please send an email and we will remove your email address from our records. 

**Safety and Security Of Your Information**  
Our site uses secure server software to protect your information whenever you place an order or access your account information. This software encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us to minimise the risk of this being intercepted before it is received by us. We also follow a tight security procedure as required under UK Data Protection Legislation (the Data Protection Act 1998) to protect the information that we store about you from unauthorised access. 

We may wish to pass your details to trusted third-parties that we believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer not to enjoy this service then please tick the box on the My Account page or during the registration process. 

**Internal Confidentiality Within The Designers Guild**  
Within The Designers Guild we protect your privacy in 4 ways:

  1. Access to Customer account information is limited to those who need access for the performance of their job. 
  2. We use full login and password controls on our sales control system. 
  3. All full and part-time employees are required to sign a confidentiality clause as part of their terms of employment with the company.
  4. Confidentiality and database access controls are reviewed periodically and updated as required to further protect your personal data. 



**Your Rights**  
If, for any reason, you are unsure about the personal and account information we are holding in your name, please contact our customer service team. They will happily review your file and update the records if required. You can contact our customer service team by email, phone or fax. Alternatively, this information can be checked and reviewed online once you have signed in. 

**Use of 'Cookies'**  
Our cookies do not contain any personal information about you and are used only to determine your browser and user preferences for our site. We believe that this can greatly assist us in providing you with the service that you desire and to enhance your browsing experience. However, if you prefer, your browser software should enable you not to accept cookies. You should still be able to use our site without cookies enabled. 

**Consent**  
Your use of this website signifies your consent to the collection, processing and use of personal information by us for the purpose of administering and dealing with your order or account, market research, processing your payments, credit reference checking and fraud detection, and for marketing purposes as outlined above. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this site so that you may ensure that you are fully informed of your rights and can notify us of any changes to your preferences. We do track the visits that people make to our site so that we can see which pages are the most and least visited. 

This allows us to make informed changes to the website which enhances your experience. However we have no idea of who you are or any of your personal details as all the tracking is anonymous. We keep track of how many people use this website and which sections are most popular - that's so we can improve the service we offer and make sure that all parts of the site are working. But don't worry, we're not spying! Our data doesn't tell us who you are, just how many people have visited the site!
