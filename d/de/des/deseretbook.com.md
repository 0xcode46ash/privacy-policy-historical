No. Deseret Book Company will use the information you provide us for internal purposes only. We will not sell, rent or trade the information to any outside entity.

### How is my personal information protected from theft?

DeseretBook.com uses SSL (Secure Socket Layers) encryption technology, the standard for ensuring secure data transmission across the Internet. SSL ensures that the data you provide us can only be read by DeseretBook.com servers. When you purchase an item from us, your credit card number is stored in a location that is not accessible to the Internet.

Because of the importance we place on security, **your browser must support SSL for you to participate in any of the site's interactive functions, including online purchasing.** If your browser does not support SSL, you can place orders toll free by calling 1-800-453-4532.

If you feel uncomfortable sending your credit card information over the Web, we offer you two additional options to complete your order. First, you can check the box "Check here and we will call you for your credit card information" on the final checkout screen. Second, you can call our Customer Service Center to complete your order. Once you've identified the items you wish to order, call 1-800-453-4532 to place your order.
