We would also never ask you for your passwords, credit card, phone, etc. We don't even care if you don't give us your real name, to be honest.

**The Long Version:**

Destructoid.com is committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. The following statement details our ongoing support for the responsible collection and management of Internet user information. 

**Internet User Information  
**   
When we display an advertisement on your computer, we do not collect any personal identifiable information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number or email address. Destructoid.com does, like other Internet advertisers, collect certain information which can not personally identify you. (Specifically: Cookies!) This category of information is generally referred to as non-personally-identifiable information includes information like the server or internet service provider you use, type of browser used. There are some cases where you, the Internet user, may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a particular ad (a survey or purchase order form). In such cases the third party advertising with Destructoid.com may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. The advertiser in turn uses this information to reply to your request. 

Furthermore, Destructoid.com does not divulge any information regarding the users who use email for correspondence with the webmaster or any representative of Destructoid.com.

**Online Advertising**

**Gaikai Service (The thing that lets you play PC games in the browser on Destructoid):**

**HEY YOU - USE COMMON SENSE IN ALL YOUR ONLINE ACTIVITIES  
**   
Even the best policy can't protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Unscrupulous advertisers, hackers, and scam artists are constantly searching the Internet looking for new targets. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your on-line activities. 

Be aware that e-mail is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that third parties are sometimes able to illegally intercept your unencrypted messages, including online greetings. Anytime you visit a chat room or post a message to an on-line bulletin board, your e-mail address can be accessed by advertisers looking to compile lists for unsolicited commercial e-mail (also known as spam).

Be sure that you only disclose your e-mail address in circumstances in which it is safe to do so. Beware of scams in which persons unknown to you request your screen name, password, or credit card information. Make sure you verify the identity of anyone asking for personal information. Always monitor your children's on-line activities and educate them as to the rules for safe Internet use.

Reactions to the Wii U among hardcore gamers have been mixed at best, downright cynical at worst. Not least of the system's problems is the fact that the next PlayStation and Xbox are going to inevitably upstage it with superior firepower. However, outside of raw tech-specs, Nintendo may have one thing Sony and Microsoft lack. The ability to survive the biggest threat of this next generation.   [more](http://www.destructoid.com/jimquisition-wii-u-may-have-already-won-next-gen-235588.phtml)
