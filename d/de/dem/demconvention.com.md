If you should choose to give us your personal information, you decide the amount of information you provide.**

The DNCC is continually trying to expand online activism and to give online users the information they need in a timely manner. As a result, you may be invited to subscribe to our online newsletters or participate in one of our online forums or communities. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these web pages include your name, address, phone number and/or email address in an effort to enhance our ability to work with you as an online activist. If you choose not to give us any information, we may not be able to provide you with timely information regarding events and issues important to you as an interested and active citizen.

The DNCC maintains several interconnected websites at any given time. The DNCC’s principal website is DemConvention.com. Any website owned and operated by the DNCC is identified by the text "Paid for by the 2008 Democratic National Convention Committee, Inc."  


  
Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at DemConvention.com. Our site links to a number of other websites. The DNCC is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those websites. We recommend you consult the other sites’ privacy notices as the DNCC has no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties while you are on their site.

The DNCC has in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use the information we collect online.

  
**How does the DNCC use information you provide?**  


  
The information we collect in connection with our website, online forums, and communities is used primarily to communicate with you and provide an interactive experience. We may use your email address to send you email newsletters, announcements, and other notices to which you subscribed or to which we believe may be of interest to you. We may also use the information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site, analyze site usage, and enable us to personalize your Internet experience.

If you choose to submit content for publication (e.g., a posting to a blog or a discussion board), the DNCC may publish your screen name and other information you have provided us. 

The DNCC respects your privacy. We will not give, sell or rent your email address or any other personal information to any other organization for commercial purposes.

We may also be obligated to disclose certain information in response to legal process, including but not limited to, a response to a court order, subpoena, or a law enforcement agency’s request.   


**Cookies**

  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a web site and stored on your computer's hard drive. A web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites.

We use cookies to tailor your experience on the DNCC web site according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit DemConvention.com, we only access the cookie file that we have stored on your computer. We cannot and do not access any information stored in a cookie by other non-DNCC websites. 

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.  


  
**IP Addresses and Log File Data**

We log IP addresses—the location of your computer or network on the Internet—for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We also use page hits in the aggregate to track the popularity of pages that people visit in order to improve the quality of the site. There is no personal identifiable information collected in our log files.

  
**Information on Children**

The DNCC cares about the safety and privacy of children online. Accordingly, the DNCC complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulations establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not directed to or intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13.
