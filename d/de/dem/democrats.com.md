# Our Privacy Policy

Unlike the Bush Administration - which created the Big Brother-style "[Total Information Awareness](http://www.darpa.mil/iao/)" program in the Pentagon to build a file on everything you ever do - Democrats.com is strongly committed to privacy. We do not sell or rent your personally identifiable information or share it with any third party without your permission, except as needed by programming contractors who make the programs work.

We collect subscription information only for purposes of fulfilling newsletter subscription requests. You can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of every newsletter. 

When you subscribe, we place a permanent cookie on your computer so you will not be asked to subscribe again. You may delete this cookie from your computer, although this will result in regular subscription prompts when you visit our home page.

We collect community membership information only for purposes of screening membership requests, to make sure our members are Democrats. You control this information through your membership account page. You can leave the community at any time. When you log in to the community, we place a session-only cookie so you can view private sections of the community that are only available to members.

We encourage community members to connect with each other. If you choose, you can publish as much personal information as you like in our Membership Directory, which is only viewable by other community members. You can also publish personal information on your personal home page, which is viewable by the public.

We collect petition signatures to allow members to express their views on important topics. We do not display e-mail addresses to protect your privacy, but we use the address so we can keep you informed about the progress of the petition and other activist efforts by Democrats.com. Once again, you can unsubscribe from our Activist list by following the instructions at the bottom of every e-mail.

We process online contributions and payments both for Democrats.com and for approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. All such payments will read "Democrats.com" on your credit card bill, even if the funds go to our client. We use secure SSL technology to protect your sensitive information. We do not store your credit card number in order to avoid fraud.

We occasionally send advertising e-mails from approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. You may unsubscribe from this advertising list at any time without affecting your newsletter subscription or community membership by following the instructions at the bottom of each e-mail.

We use anonymous aggregate statistics to help us improve our site.

If we sell the company (we don't plan to, but just in case!), we will ask your permission to continue receiving e-mail from the new owners.
