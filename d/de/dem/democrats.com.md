# Our Privacy Policy

Our e-mail lists are strictly permission-based. To get on our e-mail list, you must take the action of subscribing to our newsletter, signing our petitions, or responding to an advertisement on the Internet. If someone adds your e-mail address to our list without your permission, we apologize.

You can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of every newsletter. We do not sell e-mail addresses to spammers, and no one can search our site for e-mail addresses unless you choose to post it in your Democrats.community messages or public profile, which we discourage.

When you subscribe, we place a permanent cookie on your computer only so you will not be asked to subscribe again. You may delete this cookie from your computer, although this will result in regular subscription prompts when you visit our home page.

We collect Democrats.community membership information to screen membership requests and make sure our members are Democrats. You control this information through your membership account page. You can leave the community at any time. When you log in to the community, we place a session-only cookie so you can view private sections of the community that are only available to members.

We encourage Democrats.community members to connect with each other. If you choose, you can publish as much personal information as you like in our Membership Directory, which is only viewable by other Democrats.community members. You can also publish personal information on your personal home page, which is viewable by the public.

We collect petition signatures to allow members to express their views on important topics. We do not display e-mail addresses to protect your privacy, but we use the address so we can keep you informed about the progress of the petition and other activist efforts by Democrats.com. Once again, you can unsubscribe from our Activist list by following the instructions at the bottom of every e-mail.

We process online contributions and payments both for Democrats.com and for approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. You will receive an immediate confirmation by e-mail with our client's name in the description. All such payments will read "Democrats.com" on your credit card bill, even if the funds go to our client. We use secure SSL technology to protect your sensitive information. We do not store your credit card number in order to avoid fraud.

We occasionally send advertising e-mails from approved Democratic candidates, committees, and causes. You may unsubscribe from this advertising list at any time without affecting your newsletter subscription or community membership by following the instructions at the bottom of each e-mail.

We use anonymous aggregate statistics to help us improve our site.
