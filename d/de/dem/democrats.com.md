# Privacy Policy | Democrats.com

Our e-mail list is opt-in: to get on our e-mail list, you must take the action of [joining our community](https://web.archive.org/user/register) or [signing our petitions](http://democrats.com/organize). By opting in, you agree to accept emails from Democrats.com about Democratic campaigns and progressive causes.

You can unsubscribe at any time by following the instructions at the bottom of every mailing. If the link does not work for any reason, [contact us](http://democrats.com/contact) and we will remove you promptly. 

We do not sell e-mail addresses to spammers, and no spambots can search our site for e-mail addresses unless you choose to post it in your Democrats.community messages or public profile, which we discourage.

We collect Democrats.community membership information to screen membership requests and make sure our members are Democrats or other progressives. You control this information through your membership account page. You can leave the community at any time. When you log in to the community, we place a cookie so you can view private sections of the community that are only available to members.

We encourage Democrats.community members to connect with each other. If you choose, you can publish as much personal information as you like in our Membership Directory, which is only viewable by other Democrats.community members.

We collect petition signatures to allow members to express their views on important topics. We do not display e-mail addresses to protect your privacy, but your email will go to the petition recipient so they can reply to you. We also use your address to email you about the progress of the petition and other campaigns by Democrats.com. Once again, you can unsubscribe from our Activist list by following the instructions at the bottom of every e-mail.

We process online contributions for Democrats.com. You will receive an immediate confirmation by e-mail. All such payments will read "Democrats.com" on your credit card bill. We use secure SSL technology to protect your sensitive information. We do not store your credit card number in order to avoid fraud.

We occasionally send advertising e-mails from approved Democratic candidates and committees, and progressive causes. You may unsubscribe from this advertising list at any time without affecting your newsletter subscription or community membership by following the instructions at the bottom of each e-mail. If you respond to a partner ad by signing a petition or completing a form, we will forward the information you provide to our partner. For local Democratic candidates who want to represent you, we will send you their sample newsletter with an unsubscribe link if you do not want any more emails from that candidate. If you do not unsubscribe within two days, we will provide your address to the candidate.

If we make significant changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by e-mail and give you the opportunity to unsubscribe from our e-mail list.

If you change your e-mail address, please [contact us](http://democrats.com/contact).

Finally, we use anonymous aggregate statistics to help us improve our site.
