# Privacy Policy - Demand Progress

Demand Progress/Demand Progress Action takes your privacy very seriously. We do not share your email address or other personal information with unauthorized entities without your permission.

We use the information we collect to inform you of news that relates to Demand Progress, and to deliver petition signatures, emails/letters, and similar communications to designated targets.

For petitions, emails/letters, or similar public communications that you’ve signed or completed, we treat your name, city, state, and comments as public information. We will not make your street or email address publicly available, but we may transmit it to public officials/petition targets as part of a petition or open letter. (For instance, this information must be included to enable delivery of emails to members of Congress.) Demand Progress may also use cookies from third parties such as Google Adwords to served ads based on usage of this site.

DP (our 527 arm) and DPA (our 501(c)4 arm) have a resource sharing agreement that enables each to contact activists whose contact information was gathered by the other. DP/DPA also owns and administers the Watchdog.net site. And as of the summer of 2013, DP/DPA owns and administers Rootstrikers.org. DP/DPA may contact subscribers to the Watchdog.net and Rootstrikers.org sublists. You may unsubscribe from email alerts from any or all of DP/DPA, Rootstrikers.org, or Watchdog.net at any time.

If you enter your information as part of a clearly-labeled “joint action” with another organization, we may share your name, email, and other information you have entered with the partner organization(s) for that particular action. We house data in accounts we hold with vendors such as ActionKit, Action Network, and Salsa. We sometimes enlist third-party vendors to help us manage data.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, don’t hesitate to contact us.
