# Privacy Policy - Democrats Abroad

At Democrats Abroad, we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Democrats Abroad will hold any information you provide us here with the utmost care, with appropriate security measures in place that protect the confidentiality of your personal information. Democrats Abroad will use the information you provide for the following purposes: to validate your membership; to provide you with access to “members only” sections of the Democrats Abroad website; to allow Democrats Abroad officers as appropriate to contact you with voting reminders and with information about upcoming activities in your Democrats Abroad chapter and/or interest group(s); and to allow you, should you so wish and only with your consent, to participate actively in the “members only” sections of the website. Should you choose to contribute to the Democrats Abroad posts, your login name will appear along with your text. You can change this default setting and change your login name to something else if you would like. Democrats Abroad will not ask you for any sensitive information (such as social security number, driver’s license or passport number) and does not otherwise maintain any information about you that you have not freely provided to Democrats Abroad.

Democrats Abroad is the official Democratic Party organization for millions of Americans living outside the United States. Recognized as a "state" Party by the Democratic National Committee (DNC), Democrats Abroad is represented on the DNC by eight voting members and sends voting delegates to the quadrennial Democratic National Convention. This is why Democrats Abroad ask that members provide their full name, current address or phone number and the state in which they vote, and to declare that they are U.S. citizens. Except for the purpose of assisting officers (such as your elected country chair and authorized Democrats Abroad staff) in administrating your membership as described in this privacy notice, your personal information will not be shared with other members of Democrats Abroad without your consent.

If you join Democrats Abroad, you will have given us permission to transfer your name, contact information, and any voting state information you may have provided to the Democrats Abroad membership database, and have agreed to this privacy statement. You may revise or update your information at any time by going to your “my profile” link on the website.

If you choose at any time to make a donation to Democrats Abroad, you may be identified as a donor on our membership database, but your financial information will not be entered or held on this database. Your financial information will be securely archived off line by a trusted third party in compliance with federal laws and regulations.

Democrats Abroad will not use any information provided to us here for any purpose other than in connection with your membership in Democrats Abroad and the activities of Democrats Abroad. If you have chosen to provide your voting residence information, Democrats Abroad will send you additional information about voting in your last state of residence as it becomes available. Democrats Abroad will not disclose your information to third parties for any other purpose unless we first obtain your consent, except as required by applicable law and regulation. Democrats Abroad may use aggregate information about its members for statistical reports but it will not be possible to identify you from such reports.

Any information that you provide to the Democrats Abroad membership database will be collected and transferred to the database stored on a secure server maintained by the Democratic Party Committee Abroad. Democrats Abroad is committed to providing your information with a very high level of privacy protection. You should be aware, however, that applicable laws and regulations protecting personal information in the United States may not be the same as that provided in other jurisdictions, including those that belong to the European Economic Area.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this site or your interaction with this website, please send an email to: privacy@democratsabroad.org

You may also contact us directly by U.S. mail at Privacy Internet Operations Division, Democrats Abroad, PO Box 15130, Washington, DC 20003, USA.
