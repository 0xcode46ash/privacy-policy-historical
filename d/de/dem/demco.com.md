# Demco.com - Security and Privacy Policy

## Security

At demco.com, protecting your information is a priority. To make sure your information is safely guarded, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). When giving your credit card number, SSL encrypts all personal information including your card number, name and address. With this encryption, only Demco is allowed to decode your information. Also, we do not retain your credit card data in the Web application system. This data is requested each time you place an order via the Website.

How can you be sure any connection is secure? Simply look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing a server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), the SSL is active and your information secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from 'http' to 'https.'

Some older versions of browser software or corporate Internet connections may not support a secure connection. If you have ordered online from other sites, you have this software, and should not experience any problems ordering with Demco. If your browser software does not support the SSL technology, you will be unable to complete the final steps in the shopping process. If this is the case for you, an alternative is to print the shopping basket. Then mail, fax or call us with your order. 

If you are using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher, Netscape 2.0 or higher, or America Online 3.0 or higher, all information that you submit during the ordering process will be automatically encrypted.

## What information does demco.com collect and how do you use it?

Information collected by demco.com is used internally and to provide you with information about other products you might be interested in.

Within Demco, authorized employees use the information for three main purposes. First, we collect information to learn how to improve our site by seeing which areas, features and products are most popular. Second, we collect information in order to personalize the site for our customers. For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you might like based on what you have ordered in the past. Third, we collect information necessary to do business with you.

One of our basic principles is that we ask for only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Currently, web site customers provide information in order to take advantage of the following services:

  * **Orders.** Name, address, phone or e-mail, and credit card or billing information are necessary for purchase and delivery.
  * **Customer profiles.** In addition to the information required to make purchases, we ask for preferences regarding shipping, invoicing requirements, and email notification. We will not share your name or email address with other businesses.
  * **Catalog requests.** Naturally, we need a name and an address in order to send a catalog. We also request a phone number or e-mail address in case the address is incorrect.



We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, and special offers we think you'll find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information we provide an [unsubscribe](javascript:document.LANSA.AZZWNEWHDR.value='TB_ADM' ; document.LANSA.AZZWNEWZON.value='ADM' ; GotoPage\('UNSUBSCRIBE'\)) link at the bottom of our messages where you can specify this.

## How does demco.com protect customer information?

At demco.com, our secure server encrypts all payment information that you transmit to us while using our site. We use the latest 128 bit encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. This includes your user name, password and credit card number and expiration date. The encryption process takes all of the personal information and converts it into code that is securely transmitted over the Internet. Your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, we store it on a server that isn't accessible from the Internet. Only authorized Demco employees and our partnering financial institutions have access to your order information.

 Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions. If you feel more comfortable doing so, you are welcome to call in your credit card information and complete your purchase by phone.
