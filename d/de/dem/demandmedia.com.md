DemandMedia.com Privacy Policy  
 **Effective Date: June 14, 2010**

THIS PRIVACY POLICY, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME ("Policy"), GOVERNS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU ACCESS THE DEMANDMEDIA.COM WEBSITE (the "SITE"). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THIS POLICY, DO NOT USE THE SITE.

THIS POLICY IS PART OF AND INCORPORATED INTO THE SITE [TERMS OF USE](http://www.demandmedia.com/terms-of-use/) (collectively, the “Terms”). 

BY PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION OR OTHER INFORMATION TO US OR BY USING OUR SITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS POLICY AND THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THE POLICY. ****

**1.      ****INFORMATION YOU GIVE US**. We collect any information you enter on the Site or give us in any other way (such as through an email, survey, or letter). The information that we collect varies depending upon how you use our Site.

**2.     ** **AUTOMATIC INFORMATION COLLECTION**.           

**A.     **Cookies.  Like many websites, we use “cookies.”  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser.  We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information and to link your activities to you.  While you can take steps to warn off, block or disable cookies, if you do, the Site may not function and appear as we have designed it.  Nonetheless, if you want to take these steps, you can do so by following the instructions associated with your browser.  Our cookies collection information such as: 

**                               i.    **the domain name and host from which you access the Internet and the Internet address of the site from which you direct-linked to ours;

**                             ii.    **the date and time you access the Site and pages you visit;

**                            iii.    **your computer's IP address and information about its operating system, platform and the Web browser type and version you use;

**                            iv.    **demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; and

**                              v.    **information to combat fraud or misuse.

**B.     **Pixel Tags.  If we email you, our emails may use “pixel tags” to determine if your email software or site can display html-formatted email (this helps us optimize the size of our email messages and conserve bandwith).

**C.     **Collection of Information by Third Parties.  Some of the advertisers and other businesses that advertise or place other content our Site use cookies on our Site and may place a cookie on your computer.  The content posted by these businesses will be reasonably identifiable as coming from a third party.  In addition, we may use third party advertising companies to serve ads.  These companies (1) use information obtained from your visits to this Site and other sites to serve ads to you and (2) place unique third party cookies on your browser.  Also, we use web beacons provided by third party advertising companies to help optimize our advertising. Web beacons enable us to recognize your browser when a cookie has been placed on your computer.  Some but not all third party advertising companies provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information and an identification of advertisers that provide an opt-out mechanism, please click the following: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>. 

The information collected by third party cookies is subject to the privacy policy of the third party, not this Policy.   

**D.     **Promotions, Sweepstakes, and Contests.  From time to time, we may host a promotion, sweepstake, or contest on the Site.  You may be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party of your personal information in connection with such promotion, sweepstake or contest.  It will be disclosed at the point of collection or transfer who is collection or transferring the information and whose privacy statement applies, and it will be your choice whether or not you wish to permit such transfer to our collection of personal information by a third party. 

**3.     ** **OUR USE AND RETENTION OF YOUR INFORMATION** **.**

**A.     **Use of Personal Information.  We use personal information that you submit to us for such purposes as responding to your requests; monitoring and providing the Site; enforcing our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigating and ensuring compliance with the [Terms](http://www.demandmedia.com/terms-of-use/). 

**B.     **Use of Other Information. We use other information about our users for purposes such as measuring the number of visitors to sections of our Site, making the Site more useful to visitors and delivering targeted advertising and non-advertising content.  We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the Site, track a user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate, non-personally identifiable use.

**C.     **Retention of Information.  We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law that specifically requires the handling or retention of information.

**D.    **Affiliates **.**   We may share user information with our corporate affiliates. Corporate affiliates are those entities that we control, are controlled by us, or are under common control with us and any joint venture in which any of the controlled entities may participate from time to time.

**                             ii.    **make disclosures under programs intended to prevent potential crimes or investigate persons;

**                            iii.    **enforce or apply agreements, including the Terms; or

**                            iv.    **protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, our users, or others, including exchanging information with other companies for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**5.     ****INFORMATION SECURITY**

**A.     **Your Obligations.  You must protect against unauthorized access to your personal information and to your computer. **YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION.**

**B.     **Our Security Measures.  We have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your information. **HOWEVER, WE DO NOT GUARANTEE SECURITY.** Neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems.

**6.     ** **LINKS** **.** The Site may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
