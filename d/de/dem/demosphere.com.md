# Privacy Policy - Demosphere International, Inc.

The below Privacy Policy is Demosphere's standard Privacy Policy which describes information collected through Demosphere's system by Demosphere Clients.

## General

Demosphere International, Inc. ("Demosphere") and Demosphere's Clients ("Client") are sensitive to the private nature of information you provide to us over the Internet. This Privacy Policy generally describes how we treat personal information we collect about you when you visit our website. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully.

## Information We Collect

### General.

When you register your child for Client programs on-line and at other times, we will be collecting personally identifiable information from you about your family and your child. The personally identifiable information we collect may include personal information about you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card number, as well as personal information about your child, such as his or her name, address, school, grade level, birth date, and gender.

We only request information that is required to ensure that your child can effectively join and participate in Client programs, and do not condition your child's participation in Client programs on the disclosure of more information than is reasonably necessary.

### Website Usage Information.

Our web servers automatically collect website usage information from you when you visit our website. Website usage information informs us about how our visitors and subscribers use and navigate our websites, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web page, and the length of their stays.

### Children.

No information should be submitted over this website by visitors under 18 without the consent of their parent or guardian. We encourage young people to check with their parents before entering information on any website.

### Cookies.

Demosphere does not use cookies on our websites. Cookies are small text files a website may cause to be stored on your personal computer, and read back later by the website's server. Cookies may be used to track your usage of websites. You may disable cookies in your browser, or cause your browser to warn you of any cookies a website may try to store in your personal computer. Advertisers on any website may also use cookies. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review their policies. If you have any questions about the data collection practice of advertisers, please contact those companies directly. Disabling cookies in your browser will not have any effect on your use of Demosphere's websites.

## How We Use Information Collected

Demosphere and Client may use and disclose the personal information you provide about your family and your child to enable us to process, validate and verify your request to register your child in Client programs and to operate Client's operations. In operating Client operations, either of us may disclose the personal information collected to the state and/or national sport associations or other third parties for insurance and other purposes necessary to successfully operate Client. In addition, Client, the state or national sport associations or other trusted third parties may use such information alone or in combination with other information to improve the local, state, and national sport programs, to alert your family to events, services, or products that they think may interest you, and for marketing research purposes. **With regard to Demosphere itself, any use of the personal information you provide will be made only at the direction of Client.**

We may also share such information with governmental authorities when legally required to do so or at the request of a governmental authority investigating a crime. We reserve the right to contact you regarding on-line registration related problems or questions as well as to provide you with information regarding the operation of DII, and changes to our terms and conditions, to our Privacy Policy, or to other policies that affect you and your use of the website.

## Your Ability to Choose

### A Parent's right to choose.

Parents and guardians have the right to consent to the collection and use of their child's personal information without consenting to the disclosure of that information to third parties.

### Opt out.

You can let us know that you do not wish to receive information about events, products and services and special offers, or to have us share the personally identifiable information collected with third parties (other than to the extent necessary to fulfill your request to register and participate in Client programs), by contacting us at [ ](mailto:%20%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%20%3C!--%20var%20prefix%20=%20'mailto:';%20var%20suffix%20=%20'';%20var%20attribs%20=%20'';%20var%20path%20=%20'hr'%20+%20'ef'%20+%20'=';%20var%20addy38372%20=%20'optout'%20+%20'@';%20addy38372%20=%20addy38372%20+%20'demosphere'%20+%20'.'%20+%20'com';%20document.write\(%20'%3Ca%20'%20+%20path%20+%20'\\''%20+%20prefix%20+%20addy38372%20+%20suffix%20+%20'\\''%20+%20attribs%20+%20'%3E'%20\);%20document.write\(%20addy38372%20\);%20document.write\(%20'%3C\\/a%3E'%20\);%20//--%3E%20%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%20%3C!--%20document.write\(%20'%3Cspan%20style=\\'display:%20none;\\'%3E'%20\);%20//--%3E%20%3C/script%3EThis%20e-mail%20address%20is%20being%20protected%20from%20spambots.%20You%20need%20JavaScript%20enabled%20to%20view%20it%20%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%20%3C!--%20document.write\(%20'%3C/'%20\);%20document.write\(%20'span%3E'%20\);%20//--%3E%20%3C/script%3E)[optout@demosphere.com](mailto:optout@demosphere.com).

## Security

### General.

The personally identifiable information we collect about you and your family is stored in limited access servers. We maintain safeguards to ensure the security, integrity, and privacy of these servers and of the personally identifiable information we collect. Each page on our website containing personally identifiable information is encrypted in transmission using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, and we maintain a [thawte Secure Server ID](https://sealinfo.thawte.com/thawtesplash?form_file=fdf/thawtesplash.fdf&dn=SSL.DEMOSPHERE.COM&lang=en "Demosphere Secure Certificate"). However, no data transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect the personal information collected, we cannot warrant the security of any information transmitted to us, and you do so at your own risk.

### Links to affiliated or third party websites.

We may make content from affiliated websites or other third party websites available to you from links located on this website. These websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. We recommend that you review the privacy policy at each such website to determine how that website protects your family's privacy.

## Review and Correction

You may review and update the personal information about your family that you provide to us by contacting Demosphere Client directly. If you desire that we no longer use such personal information, please contact us at [optout@demosphere.com](mailto:optout@demosphere.com), and we will use all reasonable efforts to purge or suppress such personal information from our databases.

## Policy Modifications

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any changes here, so be sure to check back periodically. However, please be assured that if the Privacy Policy changes in the future in any material respect, we will not use the personal information you have submitted to us in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy, without your prior affirmative consent.
