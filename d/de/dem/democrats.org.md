# Privacy Policy

  


At the Democratic National Committee (DNC), we are committed to protecting your privacy online. Our privacy policy explains the information practices we use at democrats.org related to:

  * How we use your information
  * How we protect your information
  * How to unsubscribe from mailing lists
  * How to correct information you provided
  * How to contact us about privacy

Our site links to a limited number of other web sites. The DNC is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of these Web sites. 

### How do we use the information you provide the DNC?

The DNC does not share the information you provide to us online with any third party without your consent unless required by law. If you do give your consent, we will share your information with other Democratic organizations which may send you information about the presidential election or other Democratic campaigns.

**When you volunteer online:** Our volunteer forms ask you to give us contact information (such as your name and e-mail address) and geographic information (such as your zip code and state). We also ask you to tell us how you want to help the campaign.

We use this information to send you information about the campaign and to help match your interests to campaign activities. If you provide your phone number, we may call you.

If you choose to subscribe to an e-mail newsletter, we use your e-mail address to send you that newsletter. You may remove your e-mail address from that subscriber list by visiting the unsubscribe page for that list.

**When you contribute money online:** Federal law requires us to collect and report your name, address, your employer, occupation, the amount of your contribution and your credit card number for credit card contributions.

We are required by federal law to collect and report the name, mailing address, occupation and name of employers of individuals whose contributions exceed $200 in a calendar year to the Federal Election Commission. These records are available to the public. However, they cannot be used by other organizations for fundraising. For additional information, visit the FEC Web site at [http://www.fec.gov](http://www.fec.gov/). We also make a note of your telephone number and e-mail. By providing your telephone number and email address we can quickly contact you if follow-up on your contribution is necessary under Federal election law.

In addition to the requirement to report contributions to the Federal Election Commission, if you give your consent, we may share your information with other Democratic organizations which may send you information.

Unless you give your consent, we will not use the information you provided when you contribute online to contact you for other purposes (unless you have affirmatively requested a particular communication) or to solicit you for additional contributions (unless such a solicitation is a part of a particular communication you have affirmatively requested).

The campaign does use postal mailing lists it acquires from other organizations. If your name appears on one of these lists, you may receive non-electronic mailings from us.

**When you sign up for one of our mailing lists:** We collect your name, contact information, and e-mail address.

We use your e-mail address to send you the e-mail newsletter to which you subscribed. You may remove your e-mail address from that subscriber list by visiting the unsubscribe page for that list.

**Cookies:** A cookie is a tiny text file that is stored on your computer by democrats.org. We use cookies to tailor your experience on our site according to the preferences you have specified. When you visit democrats.org, we can only access the information that we stored in your cookie file. We cannot access any information stored in a cookie by other Web sites. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information.

**IP Addresses and Log File Data:** We log IP addresses, or the location of your computer or network on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We also use IP addresses in the aggregate to track which pages people visit in order to improve the quality of the site. We do not use these data to develop profiles of individual visitors to our Web site. There is no personally identifiable information collected in our log files.

**Information on Children:** The DNC web site does not ask children 13 and under for any information that can be used to identify the child. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children 13 and under.

### How do we protect your information?

Our Web site has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under our control. Our server is located in a locked, secure environment.

When you contribute online, we use a secure server and SSL to protect your credit card number and other personal information during transmission.

SSL is short for Secure Sockets Layer, a protocol developed by Netscape for secure transmission of private information over the Internet. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that are transmitted over the SSL connection. Both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer browsers support SSL, and Web sites use SSL when users transmit confidential information such as credit card numbers. Web pages that require an SSL connection start with https: instead of http. SSL uses 128 bit encryption within the U.S. and 64 bit encryption internationally. For more information on SSL, please visit the Netscape Web site: <http://home.netscape.com/security/techbriefs/ssl.html>.

### Choice/Unsubscribe:

We provide you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving e-mail communications from us easily and promptly. Our unsubscribe requests are processed weekly.

### Correcting Your Information:

The DNC web site does not require you to register nor do we assign visitors a password. Therefore, we have no way to verify your identity when you visit our site. To protect your privacy, we do not provide a means to update your information online. If you need to correct the information you have provided us, please send an e-mail to [webmaster@democrats.org](mailto:webmaster@democrats.org).

If you need to change your e-mail address, you can unsubscribe from our mailing lists and sign up again using your new information.

### Contacting us about privacy:

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, the information we have collected from you online, the practices of this site or your interaction with this Web site, send email to: [webmaster@democrats.org](mailto:webmaster@democrats.org).
