__How Personal Information is Collected__

_Web Visitors_   
On our Corporate Sites, we collect the following personally identifiable information ("PII") from prospective clients, prospective business partners, and job applicants: Name, email, phone number and address. We only collect this information for the purpose of contacting individuals who have identified themselves as prospects or applicants for our activities, services and job openings.  However, we do share this information with third party service providers for email processing and related services. These third parties are prohibited from using your PII for any other purpose.

_Web Site / Cookies_  
In order to improve the content and format of our site, Demandware uses Web site tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is then stored in our servers' log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which of our Web pages is visited, and the amount of time spent on our site.

In addition, some of Demandware's Web pages may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data which our Web site stores on your computer, and which we can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than ours. We use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example, to store your preferences for certain kinds of information. Our cookies are tied to PII to store your information and make it easier for you to use our site. We will not use the PII tied to our cookies to contact you directly. You can monitor our use of cookies on your computer by setting your Web browser to inform you when cookies are set, or you can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if you disable the use of cookies on your computer, you may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications and those of our customers.

Certain contracted third-parties use cookies and clear GIFs on our sites, which allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits our sites. The information that these third-parties collect and share through this technology is only collected in the aggregate and not personally identifiable. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Demandware only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

**Choice**

__Use of Your Personal Information__  
We use your Personal Information to provide you with information about Demandware and its products and services, including but not limited to webinars, newsletters, and job openings. You have the option to opt-out of any secondary communications such as promotional communications by clicking on "unsubscribe", "profile center", or "unsubscribe" on the bottom of any promotional emails.

We do not share, sell, rent or trade your Personal Information to third parties for promotional purposes. However, we may disclose your Personal Information if we are required to do so by law or we in good faith believe that such action is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process including court orders or subpoenas; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web sites or eCommerce Services; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our users or the public (among other things, this means that if you provide false information or attempt to pose as someone else, information about you may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions).

Other than as stated in this Privacy Policy, we will endeavor not to release your Personal Information to unknown or unaffiliated third parties, and we will not cross-reference your Personal Information with that of any other customer or entity.

**Security**

To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to allow only the appropriate use of your Personal Information, we utilize industry standard physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to safeguard the information we collect.

Demandware provides our customers with a hosted eCommerce platform and application suite of services that facilitate functionality to support the development and management of an eCommerce website.

More specifically, Demandware does not own the information that is submitted to customer websites. The information that is submitted to our customers' websites will be subject to our customers' privacy policy. The following information discloses how information is submitted to these websites and how Demandware will handle the information for our customers who are the owners of this data. 

_Web Visitors (eCommerce Customers)_  
Demandware processes Personal Information about a visitor to our customers' website ("Visitors") only when the Visitor chooses to provide such information. On certain pages, for example, a Visitor may be required to provide his/her personal information such as his/her name, address, phone number and e-mail address in order to complete a transaction or perform a requested service.

_Employees_  
Demandware employees may process Personal Information from our customers' employees for, among other things, application access and authentication.

**Onward Transfer**

__Sharing of Visitors' Personal Information__  
As part of Demandware's services we may contract with third-party providers to perform certain functions on behalf of our customers to enhance our existing product and service offerings. Examples include providing product and service support.

These third parties may have access to Visitors' Personal Information only to the extent necessary to permit them to do their jobs, however, they are bound by confidentiality agreements or similar contractual restrictions before any information is provided to them, and they are restricted from using the information for other purposes.

_Web Site / Cookies_  
In order to improve the content and format of our platform and applications, our eCommerce Services use Web site tracking software to automatically capture technical information that is then stored in our servers' log files. This information may include, but is not limited to, user domain, the type of Internet browser being used, which of our customers' Web pages are visited, and the amount of time spent on our customers' sites.

Our customers' website pages may contain "cookies." A cookie is a small amount of data which a Web site stores on a Visitor's computer, and which we or our customers can later retrieve. The cookie cannot be read by a site other than our customer's. We and our customers use cookies for a number of administrative purposes; for example, to store Visitors' preferences for certain kinds of information. We will not write to any cookie information that will allow anyone to contact Visitor's via telephone, e-mail, or any other means. Any additional use of cookies by our customers will be governed by our customers' privacy policies. Visitors can monitor use of cookies on their computers by setting their Web browser to inform them when cookies are set, or Visitors can prevent the cookies from being set entirely. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers explains how to prevent the browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser provide notice when a new cookie is received, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please understand that if a Visitor disables the use of cookies, the Visitor may be unable to access certain portions or services in our applications or those of our customers.

**Security**   
To protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Visitors' Personal Information that is processed by our services, Demandware utilizes a variety of industry standard physical and logical access controls, firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network and database monitoring, and backup systems. We use encrypted sessions when processing or transferring sensitive data through platform and applications.

We limit access to Visitors' Personal Information and data to those persons who have a specific business purpose for maintaining and processing such information. Demandware employees who have been granted physical access to a Visitor's Personal Information will be made aware of their responsibilities to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that information and have been provided training and instruction on how to do so.

**Access**   
Demandware will support our customers in taking reasonable steps to ensure that Visitor's Personal Information is accurate, complete, and current to its intended use. We provide our customers with reasonable access to the Personal Information that they provide to us, as well as the ability to review, correct or request the deletion of such information.

**Links to Non-Demandware Web Sites and Third Parties**

Demandware Customer Web sites may contain links to third-party sites for Visitors' convenience and/or information. If a Visitor accesses those links, he/she will leave the Demandware customer's website and be re-directed to a third-party site. Demandware does not control those sites or the privacy practices of those third-party sites, which may differ from Demandware's privacy practices and those of our customer. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party Web sites, and the personal data Visitors choose to provide to third-party Web sites is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We encourage Visitors to review the privacy policy of any Web site or company before submitting their Personal Information to them.
