You can turn off the ability to receive any of these cookies by adjusting the browser on your computer.  If you refuse cookies, however, certain functions and conveniences of the Website may not work properly. For example, if your browser does not accept cookies, you will not be able to complete a transaction through our Website.

  * To conform or comply with the law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a court order or subpoena, to cooperate with investigations by law enforcement or regulatory authorities or to participate or cooperate with a judicial proceeding, to enforce applicable terms and conditions of this Website, or, in urgent circumstances, to protect the safety of persons or property, including this Website; and/or 
  * In the event of a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving Decluttr, acquisition of Decluttr by another company, a sale of all or a portion of Decluttr’s assets, or other similar transaction, your personal information will, in most instances, be transferred to the control of a third party.
