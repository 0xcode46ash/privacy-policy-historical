# Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is important to DecalGirl.com/Ryan Peters LLC (DecalGirl.com). We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the DecalGirl.com Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

**Why we collect personal information**   
DecalGirl.com collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest service, special offers, and other information we think you’d like to hear about. From time to time, we may also use your personal information to contact you to participate in market research, so that we can gauge customer satisfaction and develop better services and products.

**How We Collect Personal Information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, call us to make a purchase or request service, or participate in an online survey. In addition, when you complete your online order, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

To save you time and make our web services even easier to use, some areas of the DecalGirl.com website allow you to create an "DecalGirl.com User Account" using your personal information. Here's how it works: Simply fill out a brief profile—your name and email address—then choose a password for security. The system saves your information and assigns you a personal DecalGirl.com User Account. Next time you order something from DecalGirl.com, you can simply enter your email address and password—the system will automatically look up the information it needs.

**When We Disclose Personal Information**  
DecalGirl.com works with other companies that help us provide products and services to you, and we may provide your personal information to these companies. For example, we give shipping companies this information so they can deliver your products efficiently. The information they receive is for shipping and delivery purposes only.

At times we may be required by law or legal process to disclose your personal information. We may also disclose information about you if we believe that disclosure is necessary for the public interest.

**How we protect your personal information**  
DecalGirl.com safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

DecalGirl.com uses industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all web pages where personal information is required. To place on-line orders with DecalGirl.com, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later, or Internet Explorer. This protects the confidentiality of your personal and credit card information while it is transmitted over the Internet.

**Collecting Other Personal Information**  
When you browse DecalGirl.com’s website, you are able to do so anonymously. Generally, we don’t collect personal information when you browse — not even your email address. Your browser, however, does automatically tell us the type of computer and operating system you are using.

Like many websites, the DecalGirl.com website uses “cookie” technology. When you first connect to our site, the [cookie](http://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/aboutcookies.html) identifies your browser with a unique, random number. The cookies we use do not reveal any personal information about you. Cookies help us understand which parts of our websites are the most popular, where our visitors are going, and how long they spend there. We use cookies to study traffic patterns on our site so we can make the site even better.

**Our Companywide Commitment to Privacy**  
To make sure your personal information remains confidential, we communicate these privacy guidelines to every DecalGirl.com employee. DecalGirl.com does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

This website contains links to other sites. DecalGirl.com does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner. 

The DecalGirl.com Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
