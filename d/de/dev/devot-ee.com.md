## Privacy

### Devot:ee respects your online privacy. 

#### Personal Information Gathering and Use

Devot:ee only gathers your personal info when you sign up to access certain areas of the site. Guests may browse devot-ee.com for free, without having to enter or supply any personal information.

Devot:ee uses a PayPal cart for sales of screencasts (i.e., access to premium content), and members accounts, so no address information or financial information (such as credit card numbers) is stored on devot:ee’s server. 

Devot:ee will never sell, rent, or share your personal information with third-party vendors or services, without your explicit permission. If devot:ee needs to share your information (such as an email address) with a third party in order to improve our service, we will notify you first.

#### Cookies

Like many other websites, devot:ee may use “cookies” (small text files stored locally on your machine) that allow us to customize your visit, or help us track your access to restricted areas (for those registered users). Cookies are used with discretion, and do not contain any personal information.
