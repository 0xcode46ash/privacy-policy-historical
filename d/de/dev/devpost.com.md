# Privacy Policy

Effective May 23, 2018

We at Devpost (formerly ChallengePost) have created this Privacy Policy because we know you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy describes how we gather information from you when you visit the Devpost website located at [www.devpost.com](https://devpost.com/) and its affiliated websites (collectively referred to as the "Site"), and how we may use and share that information. By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Service.

In this Privacy Policy, the words "we," "us" and "our" refer to Devpost.

## Collected Information and Use

If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Site, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Devpost ("Personally Identifiable Information"). Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, email address, password, and your location. Personally Identifiable Information will not be publicly displayed on the Site unless you give us permission to display specific information (such as your full name). Your password and email address will never be publicly displayed.

You may enter additional content including your biography; links to your Twitter, GIthub, Facebook, and LinkedIn profiles; a link to your personal website; a profile image; software projects and updates; comments, photos, a screen name, skills, college or university, degree type, major, grade point average, graduation date, employment history, jobs you have applied to, questions, suggestions, solutions, or other content or submissions (collectively referred to as the "User Content"). User Content may be viewable by the public. It is your responsibility to ensure that you do not submit any User Content that you do not want publicly displayed, and that nothing you submit includes proprietary information, information that’s illegal to make public, or personal information about you such as your social security number.

We use the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. For instance, we will use the Personal Information you input during the registration process to administer access to the Site and to award prizes by Devpost or the creator of a hackathon. We also use your Personal Information and other non-personal information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site and to better understand the users of our Site. In addition, we may use your Personal Information to update you about the Site and the hackathons we power. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such information or communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications.

Devpost, or a third party service provider that does not have access to your Personal Information, may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to the Site. Our servers may automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a Devpost website. These server logs may include information such as the page(s) you visited, your Internet Protocol address, Devpost cookie information, web browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. Devpost uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server(s), analyze trends and administer the Site.

Individual hackathons may require you to submit additional information on the submission form and may include additional terms and conditions relating to privacy. If there is a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms posted or emailed for, or applicable to, a specific hackathon, the latter terms shall control with respect to that hackathon only.
