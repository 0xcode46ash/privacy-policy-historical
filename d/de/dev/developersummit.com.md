We request certain information from you if you make a payment from our Web Site or third-party service provider sites. You must provide contact information, such as your e-mail address, and financial information, such as a credit/debit card number and the expiration date. Financial information is used for payment processing purposes only. We use a credit/debit card processing company to process credit/debit card charges for Saltmarch Media Products. We do not retain, share, store or use credit/debit card information for any secondary purposes (subject to central and state laws) and will exercise reasonable care to prevent disclosure or use of credit/debit card information.

 **Information Provided By Third Parties.** We may from time to time obtain information about you from third-parties such as business partners, database agencies, mobile carriers or other companies. If you use your login credentials from a social networking site ("SNS") to use an Saltmarch Media Product, we may receive information from such SNS in accordance with the terms and conditions of the SNS. We may use any information about you which we receive from a third party to include in our database(s) or append to existing user data to add more detail to the information we have about you.

 **Cookies.** For each visitor to our Web sites, our web server may automatically attempt to identify the user through a cookie placed within the user's web browser (a cookie is a message given to a web browser by a web server; the browser stores the message in a text file; the message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server). This is done to provide users with more relevant access to the Web Sites. From time to time we may also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view. The activity is collected and stored in our server's log files. We may log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, or the location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes. We use this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to the Web Sites. Our email alerts utilize tracking technology that allows us to see how many newsletter e-mails are opened and the e-mail address of users who have clicked on a given post, feature or advertisement. We use this information for internal purposes, to measure the aggregate number of people who view a given newsletter item.

We may also place cookies on users' computers to allow users to store login information, personalize their user experience and navigate easily through the Web Sites. Through the use of additional cookies or technology, we will have the ability to track users by their behavior profile and geographic location for the purpose of pushing advertising that matches their interests and/or specific location. We may, and may enable our advertisers to, collect your location via certain services we provide through digital applications, wireless access protocol (WAP) services or mobile phone services. We, or the service provider, will inform you of such collection at the time you use the service. By using such service, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure of your location information as described.
