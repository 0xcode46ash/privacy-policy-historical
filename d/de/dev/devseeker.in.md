# Devseeker

**Overview**

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting information you submit. This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the www.devseeker.in web site (the "Site"), and does not apply to any other information or web site. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may UPDATE devseeke_v2011.it from time to time. This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 17, 2005. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You agree that by using the Site you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below in this Privacy Policy. 

**Personal Information**

In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with information on job postings and services that may be of interest to them, www.devseeker.in may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., jobs and resumes). We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user's computer browser information, and their IP address.  
You agree that www.devseeker.in may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests (such as relevant job postings and services), or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.

We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private. When posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).

All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which www.devseeker.in is not responsible. Also, you may have arrived at this Web site by following a link from a www.devseeker.in newspaper affiliate or other affiliate. If so, please be aware that www.devseeker.in may share your information with that affiliate and the affiliate may use the information consistent with its privacy policy instead of this one.

www.devseeker.in may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of www.devseeker.in or other users of the Site. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of www.devseeker.in

**What You Should Know**

www.devseeker.in cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Site.

**Protect Yourself**

* Never give your social security number to a prospective employer.  
* Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort.  
* Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.  
* Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. social security number, eye color, etc.) over the phone or online.
