DeVry will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (that is your name, address, telephone number or email address) unless you provide it voluntarily. If you do not want your personally identifiable information collected, do not submit it to us. If you do submit personally identifiable information we may use it as follows: we will use it to complete the contact or request; we may store and process it to better understand your needs, and how we can improve our products and services; and we may use it to contact you. We will not give or sell your individual information to any outside company for use in marketing or solicitation products or services other than DeVry's products or services, and we will maintain the confidentiality of your personal information, which will be used only to support your relationship with DeVry.
