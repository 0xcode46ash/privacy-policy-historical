_When you make purchases at the online store on the Site_ we collect your credit card information, billing and shipping addresses, and other transaction-specific information, such as the kinds and quantities of products that you have purchased.  We may in the future collect information regarding your health insurance coverage in order to assist you and other of our customers in obtaining reimbursement from health insurers for the purchase of Dexcom products.

_When you’re navigating the Site_ we record your IP address.

We consider each of the above pieces of information to be “Personally Identifiable Information” because it is individually identifiable information about you.

_Other Information Associable with You  
__When you’re navigating the Site_ we log various information to help manage and improve our Site, to provide additional services, and for sales and marketing, in general and for you in particular. For example, we identify items such as domains and browser types to understand how our Site is used and to report these statistics in the aggregate to the vendors that manage the technology of our website. We also record any information you enter, such as search terms. ****

_Cookies, etc.   _  
Like many websites, we use “cookies,” 1-pixel gifs (spotlight tags), JavaScript code, and other standard web technology to collect information for our own use.  A “cookie” is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes.  You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie and to permit you to refuse it.  In most cases you can refuse a cookie and still navigate our Site, though it may disable some features. Check with the maker of your browser for more information about how to control cookies.

Cookies make it easier for you to register with and use the Site and for us to offer opt-in and opt-out opportunities, and they enable us to follow your navigation through the Site and customize it to your interests.  Cookies allow us to remember your identity and preferences so we can display content appropriate for you and your interests.

**HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?**

We use your personally identifiable information (and at times other information we collect) to: 

  * Authenticate your visits to the Site; 
  * Fulfill orders that you place through the online store on the Site; 
  * Send you important information regarding products you have purchased and/or use; 
  * Help us respond to email inquiries and questions to our call center; 
  * Help us better market and provide our products and services and the products and services of our affiliates. 



We also use the information to manage and improve our Site content and notify you about changes or improvements to our Site.

Unless you have opted-out of receiving marketing information, such as email updates regarding new products, we may use your personal information to customize and deliver that information to you.  However, we will not sell your personally identifiable information to any outside company for marketing or solicitation.

We may also enhance or merge personal information collected through the Site with data we collect from through other channels or receive from third parties in order to better market our products and services and serve your needs.

**LIMITED DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES**

We do share non-public, personally identifiable information with our affiliates.  We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, but only as follows. 

  * To vendors that help us fulfill orders for our products and/or deliver product information, publications, or other reference materials. 
  * To advertising and marketing agencies to help sell and market our own products and services.
  * To technology and other service providers to provide technology and services to us. 



We take reasonable steps to ensure that the above unaffiliated third parties keep your information confidential and to not use the information for any purpose other than providing services to us and to you under our direction.

We also disclose such information as permitted or required by law or as required by subpoena, search warrant or other legal process.

As our business evolves, we may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of our assets, including information provided by you, in connection with a merger, reorganization, or sale of some or all of our assets, or in the event of bankruptcy.  In any such event, personally identifiable and other information may be one of the assets transferred.

_Opting Out_   
You can “opt-out” during the registration process (which means you do not permit us to use non-public, personally identifiable information we collect on the Site to send you separate online marketing and advertising materials) by so indicating when you register on the Site or by updating your profile as described below.  You may opt out at any time by contacting us using the information appearing below under “Contact Us.”
