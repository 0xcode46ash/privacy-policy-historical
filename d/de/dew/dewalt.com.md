**Information Observed or Collected Through Technology**

  * for our mobile websites and apps, technical information about the device used, such as screen size, cookie support by the device and how images may appear.


  1. Location Information.  Our Sites and emails include features that may require collecting different types of location information that we then use for the specific feature you have selected, such as:


  * _Where to Buy and Store Locator_.  Our Sites may allow you to search for the nearest store that offers the Stanley Black & Decker product that you want and whether such nearby stores have certain of our items in stock.  If you access one of our Sites through a mobile device and you have enabled location-based services, specific location information may be collected for these features.  If you access these features through a desktop device, you may be able to choose to have your browser provide us your location information to respond to your request.  The specificity of the desktop device location information can vary depending on the browser you are using and how you are connected to the internet.
  * _Email_.  Our emails may use your IP Address to determine the postal code where you are located when you open the email.  This allows us to tailor content to you, such as a map of nearby stores carrying our products.  The specificity of the location can vary depending on the device used to open our emails.


  * _Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Sites_.  This section applies to additional personal information that may be collected, used, and disclosed related to our Bluetooth® enabled products and related Sites (collectively our “Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Sites”).  If you access our Bluetooth® Enabled Products and Sites through a mobile device, we may collect and use your mobile device’s location services and Bluetooth® capabilities to identify the date, time and location of your mobile device when it was last in Bluetooth® range of a registered, Bluetooth® Enabled Product.  This is done to assist you in locating a registered Bluetooth® Enabled product.  We may also collect location information about your registered Bluetooth® Enabled product as sent to us via other users’ mobile devices, and location information about other users’ registered Bluetooth® Enabled products as sent to us via your mobile device.  (Bluetooth® is a registered trademarks owned by Bluetooth SIG, Inc. and any use of such marks by Stanley Black & Decker is under license).



If you do not consent to have your browser provide location information or you disable location-based services on your mobile device, we may ask you to manually select the region where you are located, or to enter your zip code; if you chose not to provide this information some features of the Sites may not be available.  See the “What choices do you have over how Stanley Black & Decker uses your information?” section below for the choices you have regarding collection of location information.

  1. Cookies and other similar technology.  We and our third party service providers use “cookies.”  Cookies assign a unique identification to your device and are typically stored on your device by your web browser. We may also use pixel tags (also known as web beacons, web bugs, and clear GIFs) on the Sites and in emails.  A pixel tag is a nearly invisible pixel-sized graphic image on a webpage or in an email message.

Information you voluntarily supply will be stored in a database, which will be accessed by authorized personnel of Stanley Black & Decker to address your inquiry or consider you for employment purposes with any of our affiliates.
