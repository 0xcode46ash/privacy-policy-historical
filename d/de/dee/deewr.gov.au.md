### Personal information DEEWR collects:

  * DEEWR collects personal information (such as your name, email address, and date of birth) where that is necessary for performance of its functions. 
  * Generally, DEEWR collects your personal information directly from you. However, there are circumstances where we collect personal information from a third party, such as another Australian Government Department if you have consented or would reasonably expect us to collect the information in this way. 
  * DEEWR’s servers automatically record information when you visit DEEWR’s website and logs certain information, including the uniform resource locators (“URLs”) of web pages that you visit. 
  * DEEWR uses cookies and other technologies to enhance your online experience and to collect data about the use of DEEWR’s web browsers in order to improve the quality of DEEWR’s services. No personal information is stored within DEEWR’s cookies.

### Use, Sharing of Information and Disclosure:

  * We only use your personal information for the purposes for which you provide it to us and for directly related purposes (unless otherwise required by or authorised under law). 
  * We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties outside of DEEWR. 
  * When we use third parties to assist DEEWR in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with DEEWR’s Privacy Policy, the Information Privacy Principles in the Commonwealth’s _Privacy Act 1988_ , and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 
  * We may disclose your personal information to third parties in limited circumstances authorised under law, including the _Privacy Act 1988_ (eg, preventing fraud or imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or another person, ensuring the security of DEEWR statutory functions, and protecting the public revenue). 
  * Read more in the full privacy policy.
