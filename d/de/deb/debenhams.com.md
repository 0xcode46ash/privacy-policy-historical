**3D Secure**  
We've made our site even more secure.  
At Debenhams.com your security is our highest priority, so we have invested in additional security to give you peace of mind.  
3D Secure acts like a Chip & Pin for your online purchases and protects you by asking for a secret password.  
The new step within the payment process allows your card issuer the ability to fully authenticate cardholders during the online purchase, reducing the likelihood of fraudulent usage.

 **An example of the Debenhams payment details page**  


 **If your card issuer is participating within the scheme you will be asked to enter a password.  
If you have not yet enrolled you will have the opportunity to at this point.**  
  
 **Please note that this is an example of one issuers' page, other issuers' pages may vary slightly**

 **FAQ's**  
 **Why the change?**  
To further improve the security for Debenhams customers when purchasing on line. Debenhams.com treats your payment security with the highest priority and has implemented Payment Authentication (3D Secure) so that you have peace of mind that your transaction is being dealt with quickly and securely. We have adopted the industry wide schemes from MasterCard Secure Code and Verified by Visa to ensure that we offer you maximum protection and security when shopping online.

 **What is Payment Authentication?**  
Verified by Visa (VbV) and MasterCard Secure Code (MSC) often referred to as 3D Secure or Payment Authentication, are the latest fraud prevention initiatives launched by the card schemes as a more secure method for authenticating you the cardholder at the time of the transaction. Both schemes work in the same way â€“ by using personal passwords, set by you the cardholder, to add an extra layer of protection when you shop online. The instructions that you see on the pages within our site are coming direct from your card issuing bank (e.g. Halifax, Sainsbury's, Alliance and Leicester) and any information that you submit on these authentication screens are securely passed to your card issuing bank, no information will be captured, stored or viewed on any Debenhams.com system.

 **How will I know it works?**  
(If your card issuer is participating in the 3D secure scheme and you have already enrolled, you will be prompted to enter your password during the transaction process.  
If you are not enrolled you will be given the opportunity to join the scheme. Depending on your card issuer you may be able to opt out of the enrolment process).  
Once you have passed through the 3D secure process by entering your password correctly, your order number will be generated on screen and a confirmation email sent to you.

 **What do I do if my card has been used fraudulently?**  
Please contact your Card Issuer immediately.

 **How do I Activate my Card?**  
Most customers register their Visa or MasterCard direct with their card issuing bank however if you have not registered your card previously we can securely take you through the relevant prompts this process is known as 'Activation During Shopping' and is provided directly from your card issuer. This secure window will ask you to enter your card details, set a password and personal assurance message (PAM), when you shop in the future your PAM will be displayed to you during the authentication process, this way you will know that you are securely connected to your card issuer. When you create your password, you should avoid making it something obvious that could be easily guessed. You only have to activate your card once. Once your card is activated you will only be prompted for your password when paying with this card in the future online at participating retailers.  
PLEASE NOTE: None of the information that you enter in this window can be seen or accessed by Debenhams.com.

 **What if my card is already Activated?**  
If your card is already registered for payment authentication you simply need to enter your personal password in the secure window on the right when prompted.  
PLEASE NOTE: None of the information that you enter in this window can be seen or accessed by Debenhams.com.

 **Why is the transaction value different from my order total?**  
The transaction amount shown in the window on the right may differ as promotional code discounts that you may have used are not always applied during this stage. Any promotional discounts will be applied correctly before the total amount is finally charged to your card.

 **Who do I Contact for Further Information?**  
You should have received a communication from your card issuing bank explaining the 3D Secure process and inviting you to register your card, if you require more detailed information please contact them direct about 3DSecure and Payment Authentication. You can also visit the Visa or MasterCard websites for further information. If you have a problem with your authentication password it is important that you contact your card issuer(contact number is often found on the back of your card), unfortunately Debenhams has no input into this process online so will not be able to help with any authentication issues or enquiries.
