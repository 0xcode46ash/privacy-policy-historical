**PRIVACY POLICY**  
_**www.dvf.com**_

Welcome to our Website for Diane von Furstenberg Studio, L.P. ("DVF", "we", or "our") located at www.dvf.com (our "Website"). This Privacy Policy (the "Policy") is designed to assist you in understanding how DVF collects, uses, and retains the personally identifiable information ("PII") that you provide to our Website, and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website. This Policy may be updated in sole discretion of DVF. If we make any material changes to the Policy, we will promptly post such changes. 

Our Website follows these principles in collecting and managing PII:

  * **We collect PII from individuals only as allowed by law.**

We limit the collection of PII to what is relevant and necessary to accomplish a lawful purpose of our Website. For example, in order for you to purchase products from our Website, we request that you provide DVF with certain PII, like your name and e-mail address. DVF does not collect your PII if you are just browsing our Website and do not execute an order for one of our products. We collect PII about you only if you provide it to us voluntarily through our Website. 

  * **We tell you the purpose for which we collect PII.**

DVF has engaged Amazon Services, Inc. ("Amazon") to perform services in connection with the management and operation of our Website. As such, in connection with our Website, Amazon will have access to and will use the PII you provide in connection with your purchases on our Website, subject to the terms of our agreement with Amazon. Examples of how Amazon may use your data include payment processing and authorization, fraud protection and credit risk reduction, marketing and promotional material distribution, Website evaluation and data analysis. Amazon has independent privacy and data collection practices. For more information about those practices, please refer to [Amazon's privacy policy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496/103-2145204-2747809).

We will collect your PII if you submit an order via our Website in order to contact you regarding your order if we so desire. We may also send you certain communications, such as announcements or administrative messages, for marketing or other purposes. 

  * **We inform you about the opportunity to modify or remove your PII from our system.**

By contacting us at [cseshop@dvf.com](mailto:cseshop@dvf.com), you may request (i) to modify any of your PII at any time, (ii) to remove your PII from our database, or (iii) to not be contacted by us. 

  * **We use PII only for the specified purposes, or purposes consistent with those purposes, unless we get your consent or unless required by law or regulation.**

We will not sell, lease, or otherwise disclose your PII to third parties without your consent, provided that we may share your PII with third parties under certain circumstances, including: (a) if sharing your PII is necessary to execute a specific request by you; however, in these specific cases, third parties will not retain, share, or store any PII except to provide the specific services requested by you; (b) if sharing your PII is required by law; is necessary to respond to a subpoena, warrant, or court order; or is necessary to protect the rights of our Website or its visitors; or (c) if you give us explicit permission to share your PII with third parties. DVF may share demographic information with third parties on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without disclosing your identity), subject to this Policy. One of the reasons that we may do this is to improve our Website's effectiveness. 

  * **We use information security safeguards.**

We take commercially reasonable precautions to protect your PII collected or maintained by our Website against loss, unauthorized access, and illegal use or disclosure. We store your PII in secure locations.

  * **We may use "cookies" to obtain anonymous and aggregate information about your use of our Website.**

We may use cookies to personalize your use of our Website. Cookies are small text files that are placed on your hard disk by a web page server. They facilitate the delivery of desired content to you, thereby assisting website navigation. Accepting cookies that may be used by us does not give us access to your PII, but such cookies may be used to identify your computer. Some of the information collected by DVF with cookies will be shared with Amazon. Any information obtained by Amazon as a result of cookies is subject to [Amazon privacy policy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/browse/-/468496/103-2145204-2747809). You have the ability to modify your web browser to decline cookies if you so choose. We may also use other types of technology, like web beacons or action tags, to compile statistics about general use of our Website.

  * **We do not collect PII from children under the age of thirteen (13) years of age.**

This is a general use Website and is not geared to children. We do not knowingly collect, use or retain PII from anyone who is under thirteen (13) years of age. We will delete any records of such PII that come to our attention. If it comes to your attention that a child under thirteen (13) years of age has provided any PII to our Website, we invite you to notify us at [cseshop@dvf.com](mailto:cseshop@dvf.com) so that we may delete the information from our records.

Effective Date: April 23, 2005
