With your consent, we will occasionally use this information to contact you about new releases, bargains and special giveaways. You have the option of removing yourself from our mailing list at any time. 
  * When you purchase an item, we will ask for your shipping address, billing address and your credit card number/expiration date. This information allows us to process and fulfill your order, and to notify you of your order's status. 
  * If you wish to send a product link to a friend, we will ask for your friend's email address in order to fulfill your request. Express.com will not disclose this email address to other parties or send promotional emails to this address.

Our cookies enable us to provide features such as welcoming you by name, saving your Wish List, storing items in your Shopping Cart between visits, and setting up other preferences you establish during each visit to Express.com.

Express.com also uses cookies to help determine whether you came to Express.com from a particular Internet link or banner advertisement. Cookies can be used to help save and retrieve usernames used on the Express.com site and provide information on past purchases. This is done for convenience and saves you the trouble of reentering information on every visit to Express.com. Cookies cannot be used by Express.com to retrieve any personal information about you unless you have previously purchased from or registered with Express.com. Express.com does not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer unless such information was knowingly and willingly provided by you.

Every computer on the Internet is identified by a unique number called an IP address. If you have a static IP address, you get the same number each time you connect. If you have a dynamic IP address, a number is assigned from a pool of addresses maintained by your ISP (Internet Service Provider) on a first-come basis. Express.com only uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site.
