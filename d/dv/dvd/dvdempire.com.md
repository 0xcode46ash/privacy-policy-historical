**Cookies and other computer information**

When you visit DVD Empire Websites, you will be assigned a permanent "cookie" (a small, unique identifier text file) to be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of the cookie is to identify you when you visit our sites so we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience. 

You can choose to shop on DVD Empire Websites without cookies, but without these identifier files you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of our site. These features include remembering your password (so you don't have to log in each time you visit), storing your Order for later use and, in the future, providing a more personalized shopping experience. To shop without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.) 

We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to DVD Empire Websites. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring Website, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to our site and will not sell or rent this information to any third parties.

From time to time, DVD Empire may conduct surveys and contests via our Websites, email, or other media. If you choose to participate, we may request your name, email address, mailing address and other personal information. We will never sell or rent such information to any third parties.

Registering as a dvdempire.com customer lets us provide a better shopping experience for you and allows you to make purchases more conveniently, without having to re-enter your payment and shipping information each time you make a purchase on our site.

**5\. How you can decide what marketing communication you receive from us**

If you choose to receive them, dvdempire.com may periodically send you email messages describing new items, featured merchandise and special promotions. You can choose to stop receiving this email at any time. Simply go to [Your Account](http://www.dvdempire.com/exec/cust_service/accounts/index.asp?userid=-1&site=0), log in, click "Email Address & Password" and remove the check in the box next to the words "Please send me email with dvdempire.com DVD release lists". 

The only email messages you will receive from dvdempire.com when you elect not to receive informational emails will be to confirm any purchases you make on our site, let you know your order has been shipped, respond to your Help Desk inquiries and to answer any other questions you may have about our site. We may also need to send operational emails to inform you of any changes to our site that might affect your personal information, or to announce product recalls.

**6\. How we protect the security of your personal information**

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet. 

DVD Empire has also obtained a digital certificate from _DigiCert_ , a leading provider of Internet trust services. When you enter a secure portion of our site (which is any page containing any of your personal information), an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. If you click on this image, a small pop-up window displaying site-security information will appear. This certificate guarantees that your personal information is being transmitted in secure (encrypted) form to a dvdempire.com Web server, not to some unknown or unauthorized server. 

Ultimately, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you registered for an account at dvdempire.com (or another password you chose after changing a previous password). Please keep this password confidential. The confidentiality of your password is your responsibility to protect. You may change it anytime by going to [Your Account](http://www.dvdempire.com/exec/cust_service/accounts/index.asp?userid=-1&site=0). Log in with your username and password, then click "Change Password" and enter a new password.
