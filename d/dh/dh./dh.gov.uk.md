# Privacy policy : Department of Health - Privacy policy

## Privacy and cookies

  * **Last modified date:**

26 May 2011




This page explains how the Department of Health uses any information you give to us, and the way we protect your privacy. Protecting the privacy and personal data of the visitors to our site is of the utmost importance to us.

### The Data Protection Act

In accordance with the Data Protection Act, we have a legal duty to protect any information we collect from you.  We will only use your information for the purpose as described and we do not pass on your details to any other government department or third party unless you have given us permission to do so.  You have a right to access your personal data and rectify any inaccuracies.

### Site usage

If you provide feedback on our website we will only use it to develop and improve the site.  We will keep the actual feedback for six months after which it will be deleted but analysis of feedback may be kept.

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These include small files known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services for you through, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast



You can manage these small files yourself and learn more about them through "Internet browser cookies - what they are and how to manage them".
