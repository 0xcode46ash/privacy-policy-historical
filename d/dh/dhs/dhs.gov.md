## Privacy Policy

Thanks for visiting the Department of Homeland Security Web site and reviewing our privacy policy! Our privacy policy is plain and simple. We collect NO personal information like names or addresses when you visit our Web site. If you choose to provide that information to us it is only used to fulfill your request for information. We do collect some technical information when you visit to make your visit seamless. The section below explains how we handle and collect technical information when you visit our Web site.

### Information Collected and Stored Automatically

When you browse, read pages or download information on the Department of Homeland Security's Web sites, we automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit. This information never identifies who you are. The information we collect and store about your visit is listed below:

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our Web site;
  * The type of browser (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer) and operating system (Windows, Unix) used to access our site;
  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit; and
  * If you linked to the Department of Homeland Security Web site from another Web site, the address of that Web site.



This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for you. With this data we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We never track or record information about individuals and their visits.

### Cookies

When you visit some Web sites, their Web servers generate pieces of information known as cookies. Some cookies collect personal information to recognize your computer in the future. This is not the case at Department of Homeland Security, where we only use non-persistent cookies or "per-session cookies." These cookies do not collect personal information on users and they are erased as soon as you leave our Web site. Per-session cookies serve technical purposes like providing seamless navigation through a Web site. These cookies do not permanently record data and they are not stored on your computer's hard drive. Department of Homeland Security cookies are stored in memory and are only available during an active browser session. Again, once you close your browser, the cookie disappears.

### If You Send Us Personal Information

If you choose to provide us with personal information -- like filling out a Contact Us form with personal information and submitting it to us through the Web site -- we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested. We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency, or as otherwise required by law. We never create individual profiles or give it to any private organizations. The Department of Homeland Security never collects information for commercial marketing.

### Site Security

  * For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, this government computer system employs commercial software programs to monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage.
  * Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no other attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. Raw data logs are used for no other purposes and are scheduled for regular destruction in accordance with National Archives and Records Administration guidelines.
  * Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and may be punishable under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the National Information Infrastructure Protection Act.
