These features may be hosted by the third party sites or the Dwolla Sites, and may collect your IP address, the Dwolla Site page you are visiting, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function. You can change your browser settings to refuse cookies, but this may interfere with your use of the Dwolla Sites. Third parties with whom we partner to provide some content such as video clips, use Flash cookies which cannot be removed using your browser settings.
