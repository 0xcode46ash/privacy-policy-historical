## How DWP collects and uses information 

The Department for Work and Pensions collects information to deal with social security (including Housing Benefit, Council Tax Reduction schemes and Local Welfare Provision), child support, vaccine damage, employment and training, promoting financial planning for retirement, and policy relating to occupational and personal pension schemes. The information we collect about you depends on the reason for your business with us, but we may use the information for any of these purposes.

To help people receive help and support through the government's welfare reforms the department will share information for an increasing number of welfare services. The sorts of services that this refers to are diverse but include:

  * services to help people with particular difficulties such as the government's Troubled Families Programme
  * schemes to help people into work or to obtain better skills and training to assist in obtaining work, for example through Get Britain Working initiatives
  * services that support people with independent living: this would include a range of services such as entitlement to a Blue Badge
  * services that provide domiciliary and respite care.



We may check information about you with other information we have. We may get information about you from other people and certain other organisations. We may give information to certain other organisations, as the law allows, to:

  * check the accuracy of information 
  * prevent or detect crime 
  * protect public funds in other ways 
  * use in research or statistics. 



These other organisations include other government departments, local authorities, and private-sector bodies such as banks and organisations that may lend you money. We will not give information about you to anyone outside our department unless the law allows us to.

Internet email is a way of making general enquiries but it is not a secure way to send personal information. DWP regrets that it cannot deal with specific enquiries by email. If you send us an email, we may keep a copy for reference and audit purposes.

## Cookies

We want our services to be easy, useful and reliable. For services delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone. These small files are known as cookies. They cannot be used to identify you personally.

These pieces of information are used to improve services by, for example:

  * enabling a service to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information several times during one task
  * recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don't need to do it for every web page requested
  * measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there's enough capacity to ensure they are fast.



You can manage cookies yourself and learn more about them on GOV.UK.

If you delete cookies or you set your browser not to accept cookies, you will not be able to use some of our services.
