**_Privacy Policy_**

JustBalls.com is firmly committed to protecting our customers' privacy. We believe that informing you about why we collect the information we do--and how we use it--is critical to developing the trust required to do business on the internet. 

JustBalls.com is proud to be a TRUSTe licensee. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit privacy initiative dedicated to building users' trust and confidence on the internet and accelerating growth of the internet industry. They've developed a third-party oversight "seal" program that alleviates users' concerns about online privacy, while meeting the specific business needs of licensed Web sites. The presence of the TRUSTe seal is your guarantee that a website meets the strict criteria of the TRUSTe program. 

JustBalls.com participates in the Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine Privacy Program and complies with the strenuous BBBOnLine Privacy standards. More information about this program is available at [www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.com/). 

If you have any questions about this privacy statement or our practices please contact us at [info@justballs.com](mailto:info@justballs.com) or by calling (800) 595-5464. 

If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/watchdog.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. 

This is our pledge to you: 

  * We collect only the information needed to process your orders and provide a personalized shopping experience. This includes your name, billing and shipping address, contact information and credit card number. In the case of orders shipped to third parties, we collect their address and contact information as well. 
  * All information you provide is protected by industry-standard SSL technology and stored on secure servers. (See our security section for detailed information on how this works.) 
  * When an order is placed, the information submitted is transmitted in a secure form to our 3rd party fulfillment warehouse. 
  * We never knowingly release your information to any third party without receiving your permission. 
  * We do not track individuals' use of the JustBalls.com site. We may monitor visitor traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve our site, but we never attempt to connect this information to individual visitors. 
  * We may occasionally use the data you provide to inform you of special offers, announcements and newsletters. You may opt out of receiving such announcements at any time by emailing webmaster@justballs.com calling customer service at 1 800 595 5464, or by accessing your account via the my account link at the top right of your screen. 
  * JustBalls.com includes links to other sites. The policies set forth here do not extend to these sites. We are not responsible for their privacy practices or content. 
  * We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on our Web site. 
  * No material change to our policy will take place before a prominent posting on our homepage of such intended change has run for at least 30 days prior to implementation. We will also notify you directly via email if there is a material change in our privacy practices. At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the following email: [webmaster@justballs.com](mailto:webmaster@justballs.com).



You may view and change your information at any time by logging into your account vvia the my account link at the top right of your screen and modifying any entries you choose. You can also delete all information on file (but if you do this, make sure that any orders placed recently have already shipped or they will be lost) after receiving confirmation (Of course, if you do so, you will have to re-enter everything the next time you place an order).

**_Security_**

Much has been made about the security of internet commerce, for little reason. In fact, online shopping with JustBalls.com is safer than the way we all have done business for years. Here's why: 

  * When you register with us, the information you provide is protected within a secure, encrypted environment, a standard known as Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL. (Unless you have turned the feature off, your browser will display a notice saying that you are about to enter a secure web site; this is your assurance that the information you provide is sent only to JustBalls.com and that our server is certified secure.) 
  * We have taken every measure to protect our servers and networks with state-of-the-art firewalls. Behind these barriers, your information is stored on a secure server in an encrypted form. These precautions ensure that the only way to access your account information is for you to log in, using a password that you create and possess. 
  * Your payment information is referenced to your account and kept in our system; it is never exposed in transit to another location or party. 



In the end, shopping with JustBalls.com is probably safer than using your credit card in a restaurant. After all, you can't encrypt your credit card information before you hand it to your waiter!

**_Cookies_**

JustBalls.com uses cookies to help serve you better by recording certain information (like what items are in your shopping cart or whether you came from a referring site that entitles you to a specific promotion). A cookie is a small text file that assigns a unique identifier to your computer. It is created by our server and stored on your hard drive. 

**Note:** Your browser must be set to allow cookies in order for you to use JustBalls.com. If your browser refuses cookies, you will not be able to browse or purchase. Cookies help us learn how people use the site so we can make shopping easier for our visitors. Cookies keep track of items put in your JB! Cart, tell us whether you have visited JustBalls.com before and streamline the sign-in process. **In no instance does JustBalls.com use cookies to obtain or retrieve personal information that you have not already knowingly and willingly given to us.**

If you're still hungry for cookie information, this Q & A should give you something to chew on: 

**Q. How do cookies help JustBalls.com learn how people use the site?**  
 **A.** We collect basic information that does not identify individual users. This includes whether visitors came to JustBalls.com from a particular link or banner, which pages are visited and what products are purchased. This information is then combined with that of all our other visitors to help us analyze how the site is used. We can then make changes to the site based on this data. You are not personally identified in any of this; our server tracks the random string of numbers that is assigned when the cookie is originally set to identify distinct, unnamed visitors. 

**Q. How many cookies does JustBalls.com use?**  
 **A.** If your browser has been set to refuse cookies or accept them only after informing you, you will be asked to accept cookies each time you visit JustBalls.com. The JustBalls.com sets four cookies in order to maintain your cart and streamline your shopping experience. 

**Q. Don't cookies tell you where I've been on the web?**  
 **A.** No. Each cookie can only be read by the web server that originally set it. Our server will recognize if you came to JustBalls.com from one of our links, banners, or affiliates, and that information will be contained in the cookie, but no other details of your web visits are available to us. 

**Q. Can cookies be used to extract data from my computer?**  
 **A.** No. Cookies cannot collect data from your hard drive or profile your system. They can only store information written by the server that created them. 

**Q. How can I control whether my browser will accept or deny cookies?**  
 **A.** Most browsers can be set to inform you when a web site asks to place a cookie and also give you a chance to refuse it. To customize how your browser responds to cookies, go to Edit/Preferences/Advanced in Netscape Communicator and Tools/Internet Options/Security in Microsoft Internet Explorer. If you set your browser to alert you to cookies, you'll quickly find out how common they are. 

**Q. If I don't accept cookies can I still use the JustBalls.com site?**  
 **A.** No. You must accept cookies in order to use the JustBalls.com site. 

As with all our policies, we want you to know why we do what we do and invite any comments and questions you may have. We also will tell you in advance if we change our cookie policy in any way.
