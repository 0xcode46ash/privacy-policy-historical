  * We offer certain features that are only available through the use of cookies. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may interfere with your use of DFS Galleria.
  * We use cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status.

We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password or personal information with anyone.

We realize that our customers trust us to protect their personal information. We take that task seriously.

If you have any questions about the security at DFS Galleria, you can email us at [webmaster@dfs.com](mailto:webmaster@dfs.com)

5\. Principles of Disclosure of Personal Information  
We may disclose personal information to respond to legal requirements, or protect anyone's rights, property, or safety. 

We may also share your personal information with:

  * other luxury goods and services companies in respect of registration information, if we provide an option for you to “opt in” to choose to receive communication and special offers for these companies;
  * our corporate affiliates to help detect and prevent potentially illegal acts and provide joint services;
  * service providers under contract who help with our business operations, such as fraud investigations, bill collection, affiliate and rewards programs and co-branded bank cards. 
  * reputable third-party vendors for aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related DFS Galleria information. These statistics will not include personally identifiable information;
  * other third parties to whom you expressly ask us to send your information; and
  * law enforcement or other governmental officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity.



Without limitation to the above, in an effort to protect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government authorities or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal mandate, except where such disclosure meets any of the following circumstances:

  * for the purpose of protecting official or public interests;
  * for the purpose of protecting your life, body or property from any urgent danger; 
  * for the prevention of serious harm to other legal rights or interests if and when necessary by us in our sole discretion; 
  * and upon your prior written consent.

7\. A Special Note about Protecting Children’s Privacy   
DFS Galleria encourages parents to supervise their children’s internet activities.

Accordingly, DFS Galleria recognizes a special obligation to protect personal information obtained from young children. Therefore, no information should be submitted nor posted to DFS Galleria by children under 13 years of age.

If for any reason you are concerned that your child's personal information maintained by DFS Galleria is incorrect or incomplete, and you wish to have your child's personal information be updated, amended or erased from our records, or if you want DFS Galleria to discontinue further collection or use of your child's personal information, please contact us by mail and we will be happy to review, update or remove your child's information as appropriate.
