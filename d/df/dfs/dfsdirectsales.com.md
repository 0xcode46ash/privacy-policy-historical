# DFS Direct Sales | DELL Store: Refurbished Dell Computers, Notebooks, Laptops, Used Computer Systems, Monitors, Servers, Workstations

**Privacy and Data Security** Your right to privacy and data security is a primary concern. That's why, when you visit [DFSDirectSales.com](https://web.archive.org/edealinv/servlet/ExecMacro?nurl=control/StoreHome.vm&ctl_nbr=641), we help you maintain control over your personal data on the Internet. Below are the guidelines we use for protecting the information you provide us during a visit to our Internet site ([www.DFSDirectSales.com](https://web.archive.org/edealinv/servlet/ExecMacro?nurl=control/StoreHome.vm&ctl_nbr=641)) 

**Dell Financial Services LLC (DFS) only asks for specific types of personal information**  
In a few areas on our web site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to enhance your site visit or to follow up with you after your visit. It is completely optional for you to participate. 

For example, we request information from you when you: 

  1. Place an order 
  2. Provide feedback in an online survey 
  3. Participate in a sweepstakes or other promotional offer 
  4. Request e-mail notification of your order status 
  5. Subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list 

In each of the instances above, we may ask for your name, e-mail address, phone number, address, type of business and customer preference information as well as other similar personal information that is needed to register or subscribe you to services or offers (collectively, "Personally Identifiable Information"). If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. 

**DFS only uses your personal information for specific purposes**   
The information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your customer relationship with DFS. Among other things, we want to help you quickly find information on DFSDirectSales.com and alert you to special offers, updated information and other off-lease products. DFS will only share your information with DFS' employees, affiliates, assignees, contractors, suppliers, and representatives in connection with DFS business offerings or services. Agents or contractors of DFS who have access to your personal information and prospect information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to carry out the services they are performing for DFS. DFS may enhance or merge your information collected at its site with data from third parties for purposes of marketing products or services to you. You may review or change your Personally Identifiable Information by going to www.dfsdirectsales.com and clicking on the Manage Profile link and logging in. 

**You can opt-out of receiving further marketing from DFS at any time**   
We will send you information about our various used products we feel may be of interest to you. Only DFS (or agents working on behalf of DFS) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply tell us when you give us your personal information. Or, at any time you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from DFS by [clicking here](mailto:DfsEbayauctionSupport@truition.com?subject=DFS%20direct%20Sales%20-%20Opt%20out%20of%20email%20Marketing&body=Please%20remove%20me%20from%20any%20future%20email%20promotions%20from%20the%20DFS%20Direct%20Sales%20store.). 

**DFS will not disclose your personal information to any outside organization for its use in marketing without your consent**  
Information regarding you (such as name, address and phone number) or your order and the products you purchase will not be given or sold to any outside organization for its use in marketing or solicitation without your consent. Your information may be shared with agents or contractors of DFS for the purpose of performing services for DFS. 

**Internet Commerce**  
The online store at DFSDirectSales.com is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your credit card information, name, address, e-mail and any other information you provide us. DFS is committed to data security with respect to information collected on our site. If at any time you would like to make a purchase, but do not want to provide your credit card information online, you may place an order without credit card information and a representative will contact you. Alternatively, you may always contact a sales representative over the telephone by calling 1-866-417-3355. 

We will notify you of any changes we may make to our Privacy Policy by posting such changes on our Privacy Policy webpage for a reasonable period of time before they become effective. 

Effective Date: July 1, 2004.
