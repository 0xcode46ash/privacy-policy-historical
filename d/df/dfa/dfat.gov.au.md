## Http logs

We collect clickstream data in our HTTP logs. These logs are used internally to better develop the site and allow us to report on site activity. They are not used for any other purpose. When you visit this web site, we make a record of your visit and log the following information for statistical purposes:

  * the user's server address, 
  * the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc), 
  * the date and time of visit to the site, 
  * the pages accessed and documents downloaded, 



No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the logs.

If you use forms on the site to provide information, register interest, or purchase publications, the information you provide is not retained on the public web server and will not be used for purposes other than that for which it was provided.

It will only be used for the purpose for which it was provided and will not be added to a mailing list unless that is the purpose of the message. We will not use your e-mail address for any other purpose, and will not disclose it without your consent. We do not redistribute any of this information outside of associated government agencies.

If you use forms on the passports site (www.passports.gov.au), the information you provide will be stored in the passport processing system. Your information is not retained on the public web server and will not be used for other purposes.
