You have the ability to determine who you invite to become DIPLERS for the DIPLY you create and thus determine who has access to the DIPLY. Those DIPLERS who you invite can also invite others to contribute to the DIPLY. You can control whether the DIPLY page can be viewed only by your invited and registered DIPLERS or by other members of DIPLY or the general public.
