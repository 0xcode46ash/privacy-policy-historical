# WE LIKE OUR PRIVACY as much as you do

Privacy is a very serious subject. Therefore, our privacy policy is quite simple:

We never sell or share information with any one!!!! If you join as a member we keep you information just to notify you of updates for our service. 

You may receive a cookie while visiting DirtyJokesInc.com. Cookies are used for site stats such as number of pages viewed daily, most viewed pages, or most active days of the week, ad delivery, etc. No facility exists on our site which would enable us to collect personally identifiable information about you through a cookie.

**_Do you collect personally identifiable information on people who simply visit your sites while web-surfing?_**

No. We only collect personally-identifiable information when people voluntarily provide such information, such as when they sign up for a service or promotional event. If you sign up as a member your information is safe. We assign you a number, user name, and pass word. If you are Mary Smith and your user name is mary123 you are filled as mary123 not Mary Smith. 

**_What are cookies, and do I have to use them?_**

The main purpose for our company to use cookies is for a correct count of how many people have visited our page and how often. The stats counter can then tell us if we are marketing properly. It **does not** give us any information such as name, physical address or phone number.Â 

If you have any other questions or concerns about your privacy on DirtyJokesInc.com, please feel free to contact the Webmaster below.
