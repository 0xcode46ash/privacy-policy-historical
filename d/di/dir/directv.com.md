**In General**

In cases where we do keep information about visitors to our site and the E-mail addresses of people who write to us, we store it in our secure computing environment, not on the web. We store this information, but we DON'T sell it or release it to third parties. 

**When You Visit Our Site**

When you visit our site and when you use our site's interactive features (like the online program guide, dealer locator and dish pointer), our computer system records your IP address and the information you enter. There is no personal information about you in these transactions. We store this information, but we DON'T sell it or release it to third parties. 

**When You Send Us E-Mail**

We read all our E-mail feedback. Our goal is to reply within 48 hours to messages that need a response. Our computer system stores old E-mails and addresses of those who sent them, but we DON'T sell or release this information to third parties.
