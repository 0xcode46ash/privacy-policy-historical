## E-mail Communication

We collect e-mail addresses in one of two ways: 

  1. Visitors choose to voluntarily add their e-mail address to our list via one of the clearly identifiable areas of the site - ie the offers signup down the right of our homepage, or through our members signup page.
  2. By entering competitions, or requesting advice on our site via an online form.
