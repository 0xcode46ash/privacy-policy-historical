Other members do not have access to your personal email address, unless you provided it to them directly. Our eRewards program is a complementary online shopping program where you can earn rebates for shopping online through Directmatches.com when you register.

This is to ensure that your account is properly credited and to better combine services and improve content and navigation. Finally, we may use the information to send you e-mail notifications about, new site features, and to alert you to new products, services and special offers.
