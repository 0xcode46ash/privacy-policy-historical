This applies to any sensitive information that you give to us such as details of any disabilities, or dietary/religious requirements.  (If we cannot pass this information to the relevant suppliers (whether in the EEA or not) we cannot provide your booking. In making this booking, you consent to this information being passed on to the relevant persons.)
