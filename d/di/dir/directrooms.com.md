# Policies - Privacy - DirectRooms

At DirectRooms, we understand and respect the importance of your privacy. It is our policy that personal information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential.

Accordingly, the personal information you provide is accessible only by designated staff and is only used for the purpose for which you provide the information (such as to book a hotel room).

Personal information is not released to third parties, except if release is required by law, or is pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations or proceedings. There are no other circumstances under which we will provide or sell personal information to third parties.

We advertise on third party vendors such as Google, Bing and Yahoo! who show our advertisements. These vendors use cookies to serve advertisements and to track data on which advertisements drive visitors to our site, our bookings and clicks to our hotel booking partners. This helps us to improve our Web site for future visitors.
