## Introduction

  
This privacy statement outlines how your personal information will be used and sets out some of the security measures taken in order to protect your privacy. 

The names and details of the companies that offer services through this Direct Line website (the " **Site** ") are set out in the Conditions of Use. Those companies are collectively referred to in this statement as " **Direct Line** ", " **we** " or " **us** ". All Direct Line companies are subsidiaries of The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc (" **RBS** "). Companies within the RBS group are collectively referred to in this notice as " **RBS Group** ".

Your " **personal information** " means any information that we have obtained from you or third parties in connection with a service or product provided to you that is held now or at any time in the future by us or the RBS Group.

Direct Line and the RBS Group as a whole take your privacy very seriously and promise to respect your personal information. Please read this privacy statement to see how we and the RBS Group will treat any personal information that is provided to us via the telephone, in writing or via use of this Site.

**Please note that this is a general statement on how personal information is used by Direct Line and the RBS Group.  ** **If you purchase a particular product or service you will receive a hard copy of a specific privacy statement that is relevant to that product or service. That statement will be enclosed in product documentation sent to you and is entitled "What we do with your information". It is also available on line and is accessible via the home page for each particular product. In the event of conflict between the terms of this privacy statement and the terms of the specific privacy statement that applies to a particular product then the terms of the latter shall prevail.**

You should show this document to anyone else who is covered by, or a party to, any policies or services that you purchase from us. We may change this privacy statement from time to time. Any changes will take effect once the revised privacy statement is available on the Site.

## Collection of Information

  
Information is collected lawfully and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (as amended and updated from time to time). We may collect personal information directly from you when you ask for a quote or as a result of the purchase of a product or service from us. We will do our best to ensure that your details are accurate and kept up to date and we would ask you to assist us in doing so by notifying us of any changes to your personal information. 

We are constantly striving to improve the quality of our service and the efficiency of our systems and so, from time to time we may use your personal information that you give us to help us to do this.

## How we use your information

  
We may use and share your imformation with other members of the group to help us, and then:

  * assess financial and insurance risk;
  * recover debt;
  * develop customer relationships, services and systems; and
  * prevent and detect crime.



  
Your information includes information about your transactions.

As our business and our relationships with you develop, the way in which we look at, record and use your Information may change.  In most cases these changes will result from enhancements in technology and we believe, will be in line with your expectations.  Where we believe the changes may not be obvious to you, we will give you notice of them.  You are agreeing that by continuing to maintain your account, product, or service, for at least 60 days after we have notified you of a change, you will be consenting to that change (unless you write to us to tell us that you do not wish us to use your information in the new way).

## We do not disclose your information outside the Group except:

  * where we have your permission to do so;

  * where we have to do so, or are allowed to do so, by law;

  * where other companies need the information to provide a service to us, or you; or

  * where we can transfer rights and responsibilities under this agreement.  





In order to provide the services you have requested or may request from time to time, it may be neccessary for your Information to be transferred to someone who provides a service to us in other countries.  If we do this we will ensure that anyone to whom we pass your Information agrees to treat it with the same level of protection as if we were dealing with it.

## Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies

  
An ‘association’ between the joint applicants and/or any individual identified as your financial partner, will be created at credit reference agencies, which will link your financial records. You and anyone else with whom you have a financial link understand that each other’s  information will be taken into account in all future applications by either or both of you. This linking will continue until one of you successfully files a ‘disassociation’ at the credit reference agencies.

We may make periodic searches of Group records, credit reference and fraud prevention agencies to manage your product with us, to take decisions regarding credit, including whether to make credit available or to continue to extend existing credit. The searches will not be seen or used by lenders to assess your ability to obtain credit.

Where you borrow or may borrow from us, we may give details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agencies. If you borrow and do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will record the outstanding debt.

We will check your details with fraud prevention agencies.  If you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.  We and other organisations may use these records to:

  * help make decisions about credit and credit related services for you and members of your household;

  * help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and members of your household;

  * trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and manage your accounts or insurance policies;

  * check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with satisfactory proof of identity.  





If you take out a relevant policy you are required under the policy terms to tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to these registers.

We are also required to supply motor insurance policy details to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) run by the Motor Insurer’s Information Centre (MIIC) to which the police, DVLA/DVLNI (Driver and Vehicle Licensing agencies) and other insurers have access.

Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or at [**www.miic.org.uk**](http://www.miic.org.uk/ "www.miic.org.uk").

If you or other members of your household apply for credit, insurance, or other financial services then we, the RBS Group, other lenders and other insurance companies may use search records and any other information provided to credit reference agencies for occasional debt tracing, claims assessment and fraud prevention purposes. The RBS Group, the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies will also use the records for statistical analysis.

Please note that we do not hold a copy of your credit reference records.

An association between joint applicants and/or any individual identified as your financial partner will be created at credit reference agencies, which will link your financial records. You and anyone else with whom you have a financial link understand and agree that each other's information will be taken into account in future applications by either or both of you. This linking will continue until one of you successfully files a 'disassociation' with credit reference agencies.

## Keeping you informed

Unless you have informed us to the contrary, personal information held may be used by us or the RBS Group to carry out research and to inform you by letter or telephone of other products we or the RBS Group believe may interest you.

We would like to tell you, by letter, phone or fax including automatic dialling, e-mail or other electronic means, about products and services which we believe would be of interest to you, and which are offered by us and other selected companies.  If you would prefer not to receive marketing information or to participate in research, simply tell us next time you call.  Please be assured that we will not make your personal details available to any companies outside the RBS Group to use for their own marketing purposes.  Alternatively, change your selection within the settings in "My Direct Line" or when you next obtain a quote online.

## Dealing with other people

At the request of many of our insurance policyholders and to make the managing your policy more convenient, it is our policy to deal with a policyholder's spouse or partner (if named on the policy where applicable) who calls on behalf.

If you would like someone else to be able to deal with your policy for you on a regular basis please let us know. In some exceptional circumstances we may also deal with other people who call us on your behalf, with your consent. If at any time you would prefer us to deal only with you, please call to let us know.  Please note that we will not reveal any credit or debit card numbers that we hold to anyone other than the policyholder.  
**Back to top**

## Automatic Renewals

  
If you have taken advantage of our automatic renewal service we will retain your payment details in order to continue to deduct premiums when your policy is renewed.  
**Back to top**

## Sensitive Information

  
Some of the information we ask you for may be sensitive personal data, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 about you and others named on the insurance policy.  We will not use such sensitive personal data about you or others except for the specific purpose for which you provided it and to provide the services described in your policy documents.  Please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their agreement.

## Cookies

  
A cookie identifies your computer to a server that then enables information to be stored on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies allow a puter to be identified as corresponding to one that has accessed another website or visited Site previously. Cookies are commonly used on the Internet and do not harm your computer system.

The cookies used on the Site do not include any information that others could read and understand about you, such as your name, or any account or policy number. They contain no personal information about you.

We currently use a combination of first and third party cookies in the following ways:

  * To evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions on third party websites by tracking whether these advertisements are clicked on by users. We use third party agents to assist in providing information on promotion delivery.
  * We own and control the use of all data collected and it is not shared with any other third party. All data collected is anonymous and non-personal.

By deleting cookies, information collected to date becomes redundant. We will still hold the information about the cookie on our system. However, we will not be able to identify your computer as its former holder the next time you visit the Site.  
The information we hold about that cookie becomes completely unidentifiable as soon as you have deleted it from your computer.  For more information on cookies and deletion of cookies please see [ **http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/**](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/)

## Data Storage Security

Any personal information saved is held safely on our mainframe computer, with security systems preventing unauthorised access and we always ensure it is treated confidentially.

We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in an online form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:

It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image below will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.

SSL works in the following ways:

It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image below will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.

It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.

It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

We are aware that there are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force on the Site, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.

Internet Explorer 4: The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is available at [ **http://www.support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp**](http://www.support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp)

Internet Explorer 5: If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is available at [ **http://www.support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp**](http://www.support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp)
