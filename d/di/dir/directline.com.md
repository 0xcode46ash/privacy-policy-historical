We may transfer your information to other countries on the basis that anyone to whom we pass it provides an adequate level of protection. However, such information may be accessed by law enforcement agencies and other authorities to prevent and detect crime and comply with legal obligations.

From time to time we may change the way we use your information. Where we believe you may not reasonably expect such a change we shall write to you. If you do not object to the change within 60 days, you consent to that change.

## Where Motor Insurance Provided

Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information.

Some of the personal information we ask you for may be sensitive personal data, as defined by the Data Protection Act 1998 (such as information about health or criminal convictions). We will not use such sensitive personal data about you or others except for the specific purpose for which you provide it and to provide the services described in your policy documents.

You will have been asked to agree to this when you first contacted us but please ensure that you only provide us with sensitive information about other people with their agreement.

## Dealing with other people

It is our policy to deal with your spouse or partner who calls us on your behalf, provided they are named on the policy.

## Credit Reference Agencies

To assess your insurance application and the terms on which cover may be offered, we may obtain information about you from credit reference agencies to check your credit status and identity. The agencies will record our enquiries. This will not affect your credit standing.

### Further Security

We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways:

  * It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on either the padlock or the image opposite will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.*
  * It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.
  * It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

*There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.  
Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp>.

Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at <http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp>.
