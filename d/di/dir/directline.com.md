At the request of many of our customers and to make managing your insurance more convenient, it is our policy to deal with your spouse or partner who calls us on your behalf.

## Fraud prevention agencies

  


We will check your details with fraud prevention agencies. If you provide false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.

We and other organisations may use these records to:

  * help make decisions about credit and credit related services for you and  
members of your household;

  * help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims, for you and members of your household;

  * trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and manage your accounts or insurance policies;

  * check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with satisfactory proof of identity.


  
If you want to receive details of those fraud agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we record information about you, please contact us at the final address shown below. You have a legal right to these details.

Insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register, run by Insurance Database Services Ltd and the Motor Insurance Anti Fraud and Theft Register run by the Association of British Insurance. The aim is to help us to check information provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When we deal with your request for insurance we may search this register. Under the conditions of your policy you must tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to the registers. 

We are also required to supply motor insurance policy details to the Motor Insurance Database (MID) run by the Motor Insurer’s Information Centre (MIIC) to which the police, DVLA/DVLNI (Driver and Vehicle Licensing agencies) and other insurers have access.

## Cookies

Please note that we use "Cookies" on the Site. A cookie is a software application that tracks our users' navigation of the Site and stores that information on their hard drives. This allows us to understand our users' habits and preferences which enables us to customise our services for our users to provide an enhanced user experience. We may, for example, use cookies to store registration information so that you do not have to provide it to us on subsequent visits.

## Further Security

  
We take security very seriously and we use one of the strongest available security systems to protect your communications with us. Whenever you fill in a form, such as a request for a quote, it is automatically protected using something called a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) between your computer and ours. SSL works in the following ways: 

It prevents impersonation - you can tell that you are using a genuine SSL site by the padlock symbol at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on the padlock will reveal our Registration Certificate that is issued by Verisign, a leading Internet security company.

It encrypts data - as soon as your computer has recognised our computer they encrypt all information that is passed between them. Data encryption means that no one else can read or change your information as it travels over the Internet.

It prevents scrambling - SSL uses a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to prevent anyone tampering with our Internet site. Your computer will always check this code before it takes a message from us. This means that if anyone tried to interfere with a message, your computer would not recognise the code and would alert you.

There are two minor problems with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Neither problem has any effect on the actual security in force, but may make it appear to you as if it is not fully secure.

Internet Explorer 4. The padlock symbol does not always appear at the bottom when it should. A full description of this error, number Q154621, is at [**http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp**](http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q154/6/21.asp)

Internet Explorer 5. If you click on the padlock symbol to view the security certificate the following message may be displayed: "This certificate has failed to verify for all of its intended purposes". The other details of the certificate shown are correct. A full description of this error, number Q233479, is at [**http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp**](http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q233/4/79.asp)
