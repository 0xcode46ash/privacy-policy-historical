 **Collection of Information**

Information is collected lawfully and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (as amended and updated from time to time). We may collect personal information directly from you when you ask for a quote or as a result of the purchase of a product or service from us. We will do our best to ensure that your details are accurate and kept up to date and we would ask you to assist us in doing so by notifying us of any changes to your personal information.

We are constantly striving to improve the quality of our service and the efficiency of our systems and so, from time to time we may use your personal information that you give us to help us to do this.

 **Exchange of Information**

We exchange personal information with other approved organisations for underwriting and fraud prevention purposes and we may provide such information to others where required or permitted by law.

We and other companies in the RBS Group will use and analyse your personal information for the following purposes:-   
\- managing and administering products and services that are supplied. In the case of insurance products this will include underwriting reinsurance and claims handling purposes and this may include disclosing it to other insurers, reinsurers, regulatory authorities or to our agents who provide services on our behalf;  
\- considering any applications for products you may make and to help in making credit-related decisions about you where appropriate;  
\- servicing other relationships you may have within the RBS Group;  
\- financial risk assessment, money laundering checks, compliance and regulatory reporting and fraud prevention;  
\- assisting in making decisions on insurance proposals, other products and any claim made by you, members of your household, and others connected with your insurance proposals and claims; and  
\- helping us and RBS Group to understand and develop new and innovative products and services.

Your personal information will only be disclosed to third parties outside of the RBS Group if:-  
\- it is necessary for the performance of your agreement with us; or  
\- you have given your consent; or  
\- such disclosure is required or permitted by law; or  
\- we are entitled to transfer rights and/or obligations as provided under the terms of any policy you may purchase; or  
\- any such third party provides benefits or services to you under or in connection with our agreement with you; or  
\- it is a credit reference agency or fraud prevention agency; and

any such third party has agreed to keep your personal information strictly confidential and use it for the purpose for which we provide it to them.

In future the way in which your personal information is viewed, recorded and used may change. In most cases these changes will result from enhancements in technology. Where we believe the changes may be to your disadvantage, we will give you at least 30 days notice of them by writing to you and also posting notice of such an amendment on this website. If you continue to use a product or service for a further 60 days after notification, we will consider that you have consented to that change (unless you write to us to inform us otherwise).

 **Fraud Prevention and Detection**

In order to prevent and detect fraud we may at any time:-  
\- share personal information about you across the RBS Group and with other insurers or financial institutions;  
\- pass your details to Insurance Hunter, a central insurance application and claims checking system, whereby it may be checked against information held by Insurance Hunter and shared with other insurers; and  
\- check your details with fraud prevention agencies. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this and pass this information to fraud prevention agencies.

We and other organisations may also search and use fraud prevention and credit reference agency records to:-  
\- help make decisions about credit and credit related services for you and members of your household;  
\- help make decisions in connection to insurance proposals, insurance claims and other products for you and members of your household;  
\- trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud and to manage your insurance policies;  
\- check your identity to prevent money laundering, unless you furnish us with other satisfactory proof of identity; or  
\- undertake credit searches and additional fraud searches.

 **Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register**

We and other insurers pass information to the Claims and Underwriting Exchange Register run by Insurance Database Services Limited. In the case of motor and rescue policyholders we also pass information to the Motor Insurance Anti-Fraud and Theft Register run by the Association of British Insurers. The aim of such exchange is to help to check information that has been provided and also to prevent fraudulent claims. When dealing with a request for insurance we may search these registers. 

If you take out a relevant policy you are required under the policy terms to tell us about any incident (such as an accident or theft) which may or may not give rise to a claim. When you tell us about an incident, we will pass information relating to it to these registers.

 **Motor Insurance Database**

For customers who have taken out a motor insurance policy, your policy details will be added to the Motor Insurance Database (" **MID** "), run by the Motor Insurers' Information Centre (" **MIIC** "). MID data may be used by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency and DVLNI for the purpose of Electronic Vehicle Licensing and by the Police for the purposes of establishing whether a driver's use of the vehicle is likely to be covered by a motor insurance policy and/or for preventing and detecting crime. If you are involved in an accident (in the UK or abroad), other UK insurers, the Motor Insurers' Bureau and MIIC may search the MID to obtain relevant policy information.

Persons pursuing a claim in respect of a road traffic accident (including citizens of other countries) may also obtain relevant information which is held on the MID. You can find out more about this from us, or at www.miic.org.uk

 **Credit Reference Agencies**

In processing any application you may make for credit, we may contact credit reference agencies who will record any such enquiry. They may supply us with credit information, including information from the electoral register. If you take out a loan, we will give details of your account and how you manage it to credit reference agencies. If you do not repay in full and on time, we may tell credit reference agencies who will make a record of any outstanding debt.

If you or other members of your household, apply for credit, insurance, or other financial services then we, the RBS Group, other lenders and other insurance companies may use search records and any other information provided to credit reference agencies for occasional debt tracing, claims assessment and fraud prevention purposes. The RBS Group, the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies will also use the records for statistical analysis.

Please note that we do not hold a copy of your credit reference records. You have a right of access to your personal records that are held by such credit reference agencies and we can supply the names and addresses of the agencies used on request. 

An association between joint applicants and/or any individual identified as your financial partner will be created at credit reference agencies, which will link your financial records. You and anyone else with whom you have a financial link understand and agree that each other's information will be taken into account in future applications by either or both of you. This linking will continue until one of you successfully files a 'disassociation' with credit reference agencies.
