Our goal is to reply to e-mail requiring a response within 48 hours. We store e-mails and e-mail addresses of those who send them, but that information is not sold or released to Third Parties – except companies affiliated with Solution Center — without explicit authorization of the e-mail address owner.

Providing us with a phone number or email address:  
We store phone numbers, and email addresses, of those who provide them, but that information is not sold or released to Third Parties — except companies affiliated with Solution Center — without explicit authorization of the phone number owner. Providing a phone number grants Solution Center the right to contact you by phone or email, even if you have previously added your phone number to the national Do Not Call Registry.

Telephone Solicitations to Website Visitors:  
Regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) make it illegal for a telemarketer to call a person when the person’s telephone number is listed on the FTC’s “do-not-call” registry. 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B). However, a telemarketer can call a person listed on the registry as long as the telemarketer “has an established business relationship with such person….”16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(ii).

The FTC has defined an “established business relationship” to include a customer’s inquiry or application for information regarding a product or service offered by the seller. If such an inquiry is made, the seller may contact the customer within (3) months of the date of the inquiry, even if the customer is listed on the registry. However, Solution Center will no longer contact the customer if the customer states that they do not wish to receive calls.

By submitting a quote “inquiry” on directsattv.com, who affirmatively types their contact information into fillable fields on the Solution Center website has created such an inquiry. Therefore, such contact would fall within the “established business relationship” exception for the do-not-call registry. 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(ii)

We create aggregate reports of visitors to our web sites in order to measure the performance of our web sites. Solution Center is operated by DSI Systems, Inc.
