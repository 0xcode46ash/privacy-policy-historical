Telephone Solicitations to Website Visitors:  
Regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") make it illegal for a telemarketer to call a person when the person's telephone number is listed on the FTC's "do-not-call" registry. 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B). However, a telemarketer can call a person listed on the registry as long as the telemarketer "has an established business relationship with such person...."16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(ii). 

The FTC has defined an "established business relationship" to include a customer's inquiry or application for information regarding a product or service offered by the seller. If such an inquiry is made, the seller may contact the customer within (3) months of the date of the inquiry, even if the customer is listed on the registry. However, Direct Sat TV will no longer contact the customer if the customer states that they do not wish to receive calls. 

By submitting a quote “inquiry” on DirectSatTV.com, who affirmatively types their contact information into fillable fields on the Direct Sat TV website has created such an inquiry. Therefore, such contact would fall within the "established business relationship" exception for the do-not-call registry. 16 C.F.R. 310.4(b)(1)(iii)(B)(ii)
