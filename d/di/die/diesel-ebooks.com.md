GeoTrust Protection   
---  
[](http://www.geotrust.com/)     Diesel eBooks utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication and encryption technology. This is patented technology developed by Netscape Communications and relies on encryption developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. and other cryptographic providers. SSL encryption protects information being transmitted across the internet from third parties.   
How does it work?   
---  
When remote servers or customer's web browsers access the Diesel eBooks Commerce Server, the connection between the 'client' and our Commerce Server becomes a dedicated 'link'. This is done by the exchange of keys between our Commerce Server and the 'client', which each use the keys for encrypting and decrypting the data which is passed between the connection. This allows the 'client' to send information that is encrypted and would appear as jumbled or mangled text across the internet to the Diesel eBooks Commerce Server where the data is decrypted. Most web browsers offer some unique method of notifying you or your customers that they are on a secure connection with a server which uses SSL technology. Clues that your are on a SSL server include locks on toolbars, keys, and solid blue lines around your browser.
