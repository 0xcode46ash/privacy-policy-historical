> 
>   3. _User Registration_  
>  You may choose to fill out a registration form on our Web site with contact information that we may need. This information is used to send you requested information or products, to contact you with other product information, and news or promotions. You may choose not to receive any further information from us any time – just simply opt-out.

> 
>   6. _How We Protect Your Personal Information_  
>  Diesel eBooks safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We use Secure Socket Layer(SSL)to encrypt sensitive data. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet.

>  [](http://www.geotrust.com/)
> 
> Diesel eBooks utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) authentication and encryption technology. This is patented technology developed by Netscape Communications and relies on encryption developed by RSA Data Security, Inc. and other cryptographic providers. SSL encryption protects information being transmitted across the internet from third parties.
> 
> **How does it work?**
> 
> When remote servers or customer's web browsers access the Diesel eBooks Commerce Server, the connection between the 'client' and our Commerce Server becomes a dedicated 'link'. This is done by the exchange of keys between our Commerce Server and the 'client', which each use the keys for encrypting and decrypting the data which is passed between the connection. This allows the 'client' to send information that is encrypted and would appear as jumbled or mangled text across the internet to the Diesel eBooks Commerce Server where the data is decrypted. Most web browsers offer some unique method of notifying you or your customers that they are on a secure connection with a server which uses SSL technology. Clues that your are on a SSL server include locks on toolbars, keys, and solid blue lines around your browser.
