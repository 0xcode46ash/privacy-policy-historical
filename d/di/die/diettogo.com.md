# Privacy Policy / Return Policy | Diet-to-Go

### Meal Plans Ordering and Cancellation Policy

Because the food is prepared fresh, it is important that the meals are ordered and paid for in advance, thereby creating the need to have cut-off dates and times.

### Order

After you order, we will start your meal plan as soon as possible. If you order by 12 noon, EST Monday your order will begin with pick up Tuesday. If you order after that time and up until Thursday at 12 noon your order will begin with pick up Friday. 

Changing, stopping and restarting your order is easy. Call us 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If it is outside our normal operating hours, you may leave a message and we'll get right back with you as soon as possible.

All orders are standing orders unless you specify otherwise. That means we will deliver your order each week until you instruct us to stop. To stop or cancel a previously placed order for the following week, please contact us by noon 12:00 Monday (EST) for Local Pick up orders and by noon 12:00 Friday (EST) for Mail Orders. These deadlines apply to all changes and stops to existing orders as well.

Our normal hours of operation are 9:00 am until 5:00 pm (EST) Monday through Friday, and 9:00 am until 12:00 noon on Saturday. (Tuesday and Friday we're open until 8:00 pm)

If you call outside our hours of operation, please leave a detailed message including your name, Customer number (if you have it handy), and a phone number where we can reach you.

### Cancellation / Refund

If placed your order and paid for it in advance but then later decide to cancel your order, if you contact us according to the cut-off times above, you will be entitled to a full refund. The refund will be applied as a credit to your credit card, or if you prefer, we can credit your Diet-to-Go account for the amount of the purchase.

### Privacy Policy

Diet-to-Go is committed to protecting any personal information that you may provide to us. In particular, we believe it is important for you to know how we treat information about you that we may receive from this Web site.

In general, you can visit this Web site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. Our web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. Our web servers also seek (as many Web sites do) to place a "cookie" (a small data file) on your computer's hard drive which allows the server to determine the computer when it visits again, in order to track statistical information about navigation to and throughout certain areas of our site.

This cookie is not used to obtain your name or any personal data, and the information that is tracked is used only for internal purposes, such as to improve site navigation and to measure the effectiveness of our promotional placements, and is not shared with anyone other than Diet-to-Go contractors who assist us in these efforts and are bound to confidentiality. However, if you prefer not to accept cookies, you can set your browser to reject them or to alert you before one is placed.

In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose, such as to provide you with certain information and products you request. The information collected from you may include your name, address, telephone, fax number, or e-mail address.

This Web site is not intended for persons under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personal information from or about children, and we do not knowingly market our products or services to children.

### Use of Collected Information

Domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

When other information is collected from you, such as your name and e-mail address, we generally let you know at the time of collection how we will use the personal information. Usually, we use the personal information you provide only to respond to your inquiry or to process your order. This information may be shared only if necessary to fulfill your order request or for related purposes.

We do not share, sell, or lease personal information about you to any third-parties for their marketing use. We will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or in other legally limited circumstances (for example, to protect your account from fraud). 

### Links to Other Sites

Our web site may contain links to other sites such as distributors and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites.

### Security of Collected Information

We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those staff members who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action.
