Dillards.com Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Dillards.com. Dillard’s understands that on-line privacy is very important to you. We have adopted this Internet Privacy Policy as part of our commitment to your privacy. The terms “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to the Dillard’s Inc. family of companies, operators of Dillard’s retail stores and Dillards.com. 

This Internet Privacy Policy applies to personal information we obtain from you via Dillards.com (the “Web Site”). The Internet Privacy Policy describes what personally identifiable information we may collect or obtain about you (“Personal Information”), provides examples of how we use Personal Information, and explains your options regarding our use and disclosure of Personal Information. Please note that the Internet Privacy Policy applies only to your interactions with us through this Web Site. It does not apply to interactions through our retail stores, or to your application or use of a Dillard’s credit card (even if you apply for or use a Dillard’s credit card on this Web Site). A separate Privacy Policy, administered by GE Money Bank, pertains to Dillard's Credit Card and Dillard's American Express® Card Accounts. For that Privacy Policy, [click here](https://www.onlinecreditcenter6.com/contactus/dillards/layout/ESecPrivacy.jsp?clientId=dillards). 

This Internet Privacy Policy will address the following major topics: 

### 1\. What Personal Information we obtain.

### 2\. How we use Personal Information.

### 3\. How we share Personal Information

### 4\. How we use cookies.

### 5\. How you can change your preferences.

### 6\. Miscellaneous Information (such as changes to this policy, data security, children’s privacy).

### 1\. What Personal Information We Obtain.

We obtain Personal Information from you -- such as your name, address, account number, shopping history, e-mail address and telephone number-- when you give us that information when shopping or using our services. For example, we may obtain Personal Information about you when you (i) register to use our website; (ii) place an order with us; (iii) participate in our gift registry programs; (iv) participate in advertising promotions or sweepstakes; or (v) subscribe to Dillards.com E-mail Updates (our e-mail newsletter).
