**_Information We Collect_**

We may collect and store the following information when you use the Site:

Contact and Content Upload Information. When you contact us using one of our online contact forms, we receive the messages you send as well as the personal information you provide, such as your name, phone number, and email address. If you upload a digital photo or written content, we also receive any personal information you submit at the time.

Transactional Information. We generate and collect information concerning our customers as necessary to offer and provide services and merchandise, including information generated or received in your transactions with us. This may include information that you provide for payment purposes, such as your credit card or bank account information. We also may receive information concerning your transactions with some of our business partners with whom we coordinate to provide merchandise or services to you. 

Log Data. When you access and use our Site, we may automatically record information concerning your activity on the Site. This may include your device’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address or other identifier, your browser type, the types of information you search for and view on our Site, locale preferences, and your mobile carrier. If you arrived at our Site by clicking on an advertisement or promotion on another website, we may also take note of the web page you visited before you came to our Site. 

Cookies. A “cookie” is a small data file that we transfer to your device. We use cookies to collect information in order to study, enhance and improve the use and capabilities of our Site. We also use cookies to enable certain features of our Site, and to preserve your preferences and customize your experience when you visit and return to our Site. Most browsers provide controls whereby you can choose to block receipt of cookies, delete cookies, or to be prompted before cookies are received. Please note that, if you delete or choose not to receive cookies from our Site, the functionality of the Site may be impaired. In limited situations, we may permit our business partners that display advertisements on pages of our Site to set and access their cookies on your computer. Like many commercial websites, we use Google’s DoubleClick services, which may involve the placement of a cookie or use of an anonymous identifier and the collection and use of related information as described in Google’s privacy policy. 

Geo-Location Information. Many mobile devices permit applications to access real-time location-based information. As of the effective date of this policy, our mobile applications do not collect such information. However, we may do so in the future, with your consent, in order to enhance the features and functionality of our Site and service offerings. In addition, some of the information we already collect, such as IP addresses, may be used to estimate an approximate location of the device you are using to access our Site. 

**_How We Use Personal Information._**

Dignity uses personal information to provide you with quality services, to carry out requested transactions, and to improve our Site and our service and merchandise offerings. With the exception of our online business partners, who may use information to offer related services to you, we do not share personal information with unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may use some of the information that we collect concerning you in order to present you with information concerning services or merchandise that may be of interest, and we may share that information within our family of affiliates. For example, we may tailor our marketing efforts based on the types of services and merchandise you purchase, the services and merchandise in which you demonstrate an interest, and your use of our Site. In addition, we may retain and use communications, transaction details, and identifying information (such as IP addresses) in order to maintain audit trails for security purposes. 

In some circumstances, we provide personal information to other providers of goods and services so that they may assist us in providing services or merchandise to you. However, we require that those providers use personal information only for that purpose, and we require our providers to provide assurances that they will appropriately protect personal information entrusted to them. 

**_Protecting Personal Information_**

Dignity is committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to secure and protect the information we receive. Please remember, though, that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. 

**_Disclosure Policy_**

We disclose personal information as necessary to operate our business, such as in connection with providing services to you or processing your transactions. We also may disclose information concerning you if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to protect and defend our rights or property, or those of our clients. In addition, we may share anonymous information aggregated to reflect Site traffic volume, average time spent on the Site, pages viewed, and other such parameters with our business partners, advertisers, consultants, or other persons or entities for any legitimate business purpose. 

**_Public Disclosure Using Non-Restricted Services_**

As stated above, when you post any information to an online obituary, guestbook, or memorial using our Site, such information is viewable by the public, and the security and other protective provisions of this privacy policy do not apply. Our Site makes online and voice recorded Guest Books, Death Notices, Obituaries, Biographies, Photo Galleries, Moving Memories®, other online memorials, location of funeral and cemetery services, and other postings to our services available for viewing by all our visitors unless the sponsor or host of a service selects a privacy setting that restricts public access (available as an option only on certain services). Any information disclosed on a non-restricted service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without your or our knowledge. Also, please keep in mind that the posting of your user ID or alias in connection with public disclosures may result in the transmission of unsolicited messages to you from persons and entities over which we have no control. Please exercise caution and good judgment when disclosing any personal information in any non-restricted service. 

Note that we cannot be responsible for any online postings by a family member, friend, acquaintance or other person or entity outside of our control. Such activities are also outside the scope of this policy. 

**_Advertising_**

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
