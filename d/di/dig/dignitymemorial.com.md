**_How We Use Personal Information_**  
We use personal information to provide you with quality services, to carry out requested transactions, and to improve our Site and our service and merchandise offerings. We may use some of the information that we collect concerning you in order to present you with information concerning services or merchandise that may be of interest, and we may share that information within our family of affiliates. For example, we may tailor our marketing efforts based on the types of services and merchandise you purchase, the services and merchandise in which you demonstrate an interest, and your use of our Site. In some instances, we may share limited personal information with third-party online floral and memorial websites in connection with our funeral, cremation, or other time-of-death services, and when you navigate to those third-party websites from our Site.

We also provide personal information to third-party providers of goods and services who assist us in providing services or merchandise to you. We require that those providers use personal information only for that purpose, and we also require assurances that they will appropriately protect personal information entrusted to them. 

**_Protecting Personal Information_**  
We are committed to maintaining the security of personal information. We employ reasonable security measures to secure and protect the information we receive. Please remember, though, that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure. 

**_Disclosure Policy_**  
We disclose personal information as necessary to operate our business, such as in connection with providing services to you or processing your transactions. We also may disclose information concerning you if required to do so by law or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with a legal obligation or to protect and defend our rights or property, or those of others.

As stated above, when you post any information or other content to an online obituary, guestbook, or memorial using our Site, such information and/or other content is viewable by the public, and the security and other protective provisions of this Privacy Policy do not apply. Our Sites make online and voice-recorded Guest Books, Death Notices, Obituaries, Biographies, Photo Galleries, Moving Memories®, other online memorials, location of funeral and cemetery services, and other postings to our non-restricted services available for viewing by all our visitors unless the sponsor or host of a service selects a privacy setting that restricts public access (available as an option only on certain services). Any information or other content disclosed on a non-restricted service becomes public information and may be collected and used by others without your or our knowledge. Also, please keep in mind that the posting of your user ID or alias in connection with public disclosures may result in the transmission of unsolicited messages to you from persons and entities over which we have no control. Please exercise caution and good judgment when disclosing any personal information in any non-restricted service. Note that we cannot be responsible for any online postings by a family member, friend, acquaintance or other person or entity outside of our control. Such activities and the associated postings are also outside the scope of this Policy.

If a parent or legal guardian posts an entry on behalf of a child under the age of 13 on an online guestbook or other section of the Site, the parent or legal guardian must indicate that such entry is being made on behalf of the child by the parent or legal guardian.
