# GipsyMedia Limited - Privacy Statement

Your privacy on the Internet is important to us. Below is information regarding GipsyMedia's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.

If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it.

GipsyMedia gathers two types of information about users: data that users provide through registration on our sites and through registration of DigiGuide; and aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. Such information enables us to specify features for our products appropriate to our users, to better tailor our web site content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. Because GipsyMedia derives most of its revenue from advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users.

GipsyMedia gathers user information in the following processes:

### Voting

> GipsyMedia offers interactive votes for users so they can easily choose the channels and features that should be developed for our products.

### Bulletin Board/Forums

> Users of the GipsyMedia Bulletin Boards can register to interact with these boards and forums. Registration is free and users can continue using these services even if they do not register. During registration the user is required to supply a username, password and email address. The password is stored in encrypted form only. The user can later supply more information that he/she wants to share with others as part of their profile.

### Electronic Newsletters

> GipsyMedia offers free newsletters to users. GipsyMedia gathers the email addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by following the instructions provided in every newsletter that describes how to unsubscribe.

### Surveys

> Occasionally GipsyMedia conducts user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our advertisers and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

### Usage Tracking

> GipsyMedia tracks user traffic patterns throughout our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. GipsyMedia does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser).

### Cookies

> A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.
> 
> If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.
> 
> You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you will need to have cookies turned on to use some GipsyMedia products.

### Advertising

> GipsyMedia works with a third party that serves ads to their sites. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on these sites, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.

GipsyMedia uses any information voluntarily given by our users two-fold: 

  * to customise the development of our products so that it better suits their requirements
  * to enhance their experience at our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on their interests



GipsyMedia uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. GipsyMedia does not control the practices of our advertisers. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers uses information about you when you click their ad and go to their content, please contact them directly.

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with the GipsyMedia web sites, you can contact [webmaster@gipsymedia.com](mailto:webmaster@gipsymedia.com).
