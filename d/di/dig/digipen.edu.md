DIT has certified that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, which are the basis for the principles of this Policy.

### PRINCIPLES 

**Notice**

DIT receives personal information about individuals in the EEA collected by DIT and its affiliates. This personal information may include basic contact information like name and email address for current and prospective students, as well as billing and academic information of current students such as classes taken and grades. 

DIT uses this information to provide our educational services, support for such services, for billing, for marketing communications, and to correspond with students and faculty. This information also facilitates our affiliates’ and franchisees’ services. 

DIT also receives information about employees of DIT’s subsidiaries who are located in the European Union, and which is transferred in the context of the employment relationship. DIT uses this information for internal employment and human resources purposes. DIT commits to cooperate in investigations by and to comply with the advice of competent EU authorities. 

DIT will subject all personal information received via the Privacy Shield to its Privacy Principles. 

DIT is subject to the investigative and enforcement authority of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), is obliged to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, for law enforcement and national security purposes, and has potential liability for onward transfers to third parties. 

Additionally, an individual may be allowed to invoke binding arbitration to resolve disputes under certain limited conditions. More information is available in the Dispute Resolution section below. 

**Choice**

DIT will offer individuals the opportunity to choose whether their information is to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. An individual may opt-out of such uses of their personal information by contacting us at the address given below. DIT does not disclose personal information to non-agent third parties. If this changes, DIT will offer an opt-out to individuals. 

DIT will not use sensitive personal information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual unless DIT has received the individual’s affirmative and explicit consent (opt-in). DIT will treat as sensitive any personal information received from a third party where the third party identifies and treats it as sensitive. 

**Data Integrity**

For information received under the Privacy Shield, DIT will require its agents to safeguard personal information consistent with this Policy by contract, obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the Privacy Shield Principles. 

Under certain circumstances, DIT may bear liability for onward transfers of personal data where its agent processes personal data inconsistent with the Privacy Shield Principles, unless DIT proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

**Access and Correction**

Upon request, DIT will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, DIT will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete.
