### Digimarc Corporation Internet Privacy Policy

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/10647) This confirms that Digimarc is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe's certification is valid for Digimarc's website gathering and dissemination practices only and does not cover any software or services.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the webmaster by email at [webmaster@digimarc.com](mailto:webmaster@digimarc.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog_intro.html>. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

This statement discloses the privacy practices for the Digimarc.com website. You may provide Digimarc with information about yourself through two of Digimarc's offerings: the Digimarc MediaBridge Internet-Access System and the Digimarc Media Commerce Watermark Subscription Registration Program. This page discusses our privacy practices concerning each offering and then presents practices that apply to both. We also provide e-mail addresses and phone numbers to contact us concerning these offerings. 

**Digimarc MediaBridge Internet-Access System**  
Digimarc has developed a publication enhancement system, known as the "Digimarc MediaBridge" system, based on its proprietary digital watermark technology, that provides users with direct access to selected Internet destinations whenever they show specially-coded pages to video cameras and other image capture devices connected to personal computers and other devices having Internet access.

The Digimarc MediaBridge system never transmits any video or image data from your computer onto the Internet. Rather, the software operates by decoding a numeric code from the watermarked items, and transmitting this numeric code. 

Unless you have voluntarily consented to provide Digimarc information about yourself, you can use this system without providing us your name or email address. In other words, the software that enables your camera or other imaging device to detect the watermark in the item can be installed without you telling us who you are. If you choose, though, you can tell us your zip code, country and hardware specifications that we analyze and share with our partners for marketing purposes. You can use this system, however, without even providing us that information. 

If you have any questions regarding your information, choose to change it or have us delete what you provided to us, please contact our Digimarc MediaBridge group at 877-477-9992 or [helpdesk@digimarc.com](mailto:helpdesk@digimarc.com).

**Digimarc Media Commerce Watermark Subscription Registration Program**  
Photographers, web designers, and other people and organizations involved in image-processing can subscribe to digital watermark embedding and related services through our website by obtaining a Digimarc ID. In order to sign up for a Digimarc ID under the Digimarc Watermark Subscription Registration Program, you must first complete the [registration form](https://www.digimarc.com/mcregistration/MCRegister1.asp?action=i&CookieCheck=yes). During registration you are required to give your contact information (such as name, country and email address) and, if a fee is required, payment information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used to contact you about the services on our site for which you have expressed interest, for billing purposes and to obtain your feedback. It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as profession, digital camera ownership, embedding tool used) and unique identifiers (such as URL linked to Digimarc). You may update your information in the Member subscription area, <https://www.digimarc.com/mcregistration/login.asp>.

**Administrative Email Communications**  
We may send administrative type emails to you. As long as you are a registrant, you are not able to un-subscribe from these administrative emails. These emails contain important information about the service. We communicate with you to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account via email or phone. 

**Contests**  
We run contests and promotions on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their email address). We use this information to contact the winners and to send visitors information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from digimarc.com; see the opt-out section below. Personal information on contest participants, including name, email, likeness, etc. are not disclosed on our web site, nor is said information distributed to third parties. Contestants should read the rules of each contest for more information.

**Newsletter/Opt-Out**  
You are given the opportunity to opt-out to receive e-mail regarding new products and features from Digimarc and promotional offers and information from our partners. If you no longer wish to receive promotional materials, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by contacting us at 503-495-4623 or [info@digimarc.com](mailto:info@digimarc.com).

**Security**  
This web site takes precautions to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the web site, we endeavor to protect your information both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software known as Secure Sockets Layer. 

While we use Secure Sockets Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also endeavor to secure user-information off-line by limiting internal access to such information on a need to know basis. Furthermore, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind locked doors. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Digimarc is not responsible for the content or privacy practices of such other sites. We try to make you aware when you are leaving our site and we encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Digimarc's web site. 

**Cookies**  
We use cookies to store information during and between visits to our site. Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor from one page to another. Web browsers store cookies so that the browser itself can remember some information and then, on request, pass all that information up to the server at one time. We use cookies to remember your user name and password (if you select the appropriate checkbox), and maintain "state" during use of certain portions of the site. Portions of our website require the use of cookies. Turning off cookies or rejecting the Digimarc.com cookie will prevent you from utilizing the ImageBridge signup or ImageBridge user pages. At no time do cookies pass information, or become available to, third party web pages outside of Digimarc.com.

**Log Files**  
When you visit our website, we collect information about your visit. We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit our site. This information is used in the aggregate for site monitoring and improvements, and does not contain personal information such as name, email address, etc.

**Sharing of Information**  
Digimarc.com contains several forms which gather user information. Unless otherwise specified, or the user chooses to opt out, some contact and demographic information is shared with marketing partners and corporate customers who use our services, such as hit counts by geography (zip code). Contact information (e.g. email address) for those who opt in during registration is shared with business partners, corporate customers and third parties interested in informational or promotional mailing to our registered user base.

**Intermediaries**  
E-Commerce transactions on portions of Digimarc.com pass user information through intermediary service providers. Specifically, we process credit card verification transactions using Verisign's PayPal credit card verification service. Information collected by intermediaries is used solely for the purpose of verifying payment information and is not distributed.

**Feedback on Privacy Concerns**  
If you would like to express concerns or complaints regarding Digimarc's privacy practices, please send email to [webmaster@digimarc.com](mailto:webmaster@digimarc.com).

**Legal Disclaimer**  
Personally Identifiable Information and/or Third Party Personally Identifiable Information provided to Digimarc is subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. 

Digimarc reserves the right to change its privacy policy. If we change our privacy practices, the changes will not relate to previously collected data. If we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
