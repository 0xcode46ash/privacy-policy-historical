When our registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with encryption software known as Secure Sockets Layer.

While we use Secure Sockets Layer encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also endeavor to secure user-information off-line by limiting internal access to such information on a need to know basis. Furthermore, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, which is only accessible by specific employees of Digimarc Corporation.
