# Privacy | Digital Insight

At Digital Insight, we take your privacy seriously. It’s just one of the reasons we’re the leading provider of outsourced online banking solutions to mid-market banks and credit unions. Not only do we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your information, but we restrict its access to only those employees who need to know it in the course of their job responsibilities. Read on to see how you use the information you share with us online, and why it matters. 

### Why We Collect Information
