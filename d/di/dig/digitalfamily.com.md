# DigitalFamily.com Privacy Policy

Digital Family was created by Janine Warner and is owned by Artesian Media, Inc. 

We are firmly committed to protecting the privacy of those who visit our Web sites. Because we do gather certain types of information when you purchase goods from us or sign up for mailing lists or special features, we want you to understand the terms and conditions surrounding the gathering and use of that information. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and how our visitors can correct or change it.

This Policy discloses the privacy practices for the entire Artesian Media, Inc. network of sites, which includes DigitalFamily.com, ArtesianMedia.com, JCWarner.com, ChocolateGameRules.com, SipsFromtheFirehose.com, HardNewsInc.com, California Wildlife Photography site, and others even those that are not listed here. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [info@artesianmedia.com](mailto:info@artesianmedia.com) for clarification.

**What information does Digital Family gather/track?**

We collect two types of information about our site visitors: aggregated "traffic data" derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites using Google Analytics; and personal data that some visitors provide through optional, voluntary participation in our Reader’s Corner, by ordering books or videos using Google Checkout, or through email messages sent to any of the email addresses included on any of the Artesian Media sites. 

We collect information and use it to tailor our content to our users' needs and to help our advertisers better understand the demographics of our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information with our advertisers and partners. We _never_ share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party.

> **Contests**   
>  Digital Family and Artesian Media, Inc. may offer from time to time voluntary, optional contests in which we request certain personal information, including the user's name, e-mail address, company name, job title/function, and the other information specific to the contest. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that his or her entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Under no circumstances will Artesian Media, Inc. divulge this information to a third party.
> 
> Because the rules and terms of each contest can vary, all information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.
> 
> **E-mail**   
>  Users of the Digital Famly, or Artesian Media, Inc. sites may voluntarily e-mail us from time to time with requests for information and questions about the books, videos, and other materials . 
> 
> Digital Family and Artesian Media, Inc. reserves the right to use the contents of emails we receive in any way, including by publishing the contents of those email messages on any of our sites. We make a good faith effort to remove any identifying information from emails before posting their contents.
> 
> **Readers Corner**  
>  Users of the Artesian Media, Inc. sites may voluntarily choose to gain access to the Readers Corner at DigitalFamily.com or other Artesian Media sites.  Information submitted during the process of gaining access to the Readers Corner may include the user's name and other contact information in addition to his or her e-mail address. Artesian Media, Inc. reserves the right to use the contents of these submissions to contact users directly, on occasion, and always with an easy eay to opt-out. We don't divulge contact or other personal information to third parties.

**How Artesian Media uses the information it gathers/tracks**

Artesian Media uses any information voluntarily provided by our users to enhance their experience in our network of sites, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

If you do not wish to receive such mailings, please e-mail us at [info@artesianmedia.com](mailto:info@artesianmedia.com)

  
We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like, based on traffic to those areas. Artesian Media does not track what each user reads, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us to continue to build a better service for you. 

Artesian Media creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because Artesian Media doesn't track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked on a specific ad.

**With whom does Artesian Media share the information it gathers/tracks?**

Artesian Media uses the information described above to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience's demographics. This is essential to keeping our service free. We do not share information about individual users with any third party.

The Artesian Media sites contain links to third party sites. Artesian Media is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such sites. If you have questions about how one of our advertisers or any other site we link to, uses information about you when you click through to its site, please contact that site directly.

Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name and e-mail addresses) on any comments, bulletin boards, or in chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties.

**What is Artesian Media’s opt-out policy?**

Artesian Media gives users options wherever necessary and practical. Such choices include:

Opting not to receive any informational mailings forwarded from third parties when subscribing to or ordering our electronic newsletter or when accessing any special sections of our sites, including the Readers Corner.

Opting not to provide certain personal information when completing an online form, subscribing to a publication, or participating in a contest. 

Opting not to subscribe to or order one of our publications or our electronic newsletter, which eliminates the need for any personally identifying information from our users.
