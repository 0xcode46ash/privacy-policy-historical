## Privacy Policy

Pericom cares about your right to privacy. This policy explains how we intend to handle any personally identifying information you give us online. Personally identifying information is information that enables us to identify you, for example, your e-mail address, name, home phone number, etc.

#### How We Collect and Use Personally Identifying Information

You are welcome to visit Pericom's web sites while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personally identifying information. Sharing your personally identifying information is strictly voluntary.

Sharing your personally identifying information makes it easier for you to:

  * Request information or materials concerning our products.
  * Receive personalized newsletters and other messages about our products that we feel may be relevant to your interests, and generally facilitate future communication with you.
  * Participate in surveys or register to participate in a promotion (such as contests or give-a-ways).



We also collect certain anonymous information that cannot be associated with you personally, such as the domains from which you visit us, the number of visitors to our web sites, browsing patterns and areas of interest. We analyze this data to assess trends, statistics and customers' needs, to help us improve our web sites, products and better serve our customers.

#### You May Opt Out at Any Time

You may opt out at any time. By way of example, when you are registered with Pericom, you will have the option of choosing not to receive additional communications from Pericom on our products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. If you choose to receive these additional communications and later change your mind, you may unsubscribe at any time. For example, e-mail messages will contain instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from receiving the email in question.

#### Safeguarding Personally Identifying Information

We aim to protect the personally identifying information you share with us. Pericom uses a variety of commercially available security technologies to protect your personally identifying information, including secure servers, firewalls and encryption of financial data.
