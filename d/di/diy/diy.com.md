Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computers hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and help us to track visitors to our site, so we can better understand what portions of our site best serve you.

Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they do enable us to provide features such as the Express Checkout and enable us to store items in your Shopping Basket between visits.

**Links**

We may from time to time establish relationships with other companies that will enable you to access the web sites of such companies directly from our site. Each individual company operates its own policy regarding the sale of personal information and the use of cookies. If you have a particular interest or concern regarding the way your personal information will be used then you are advised to read the privacy statement on the relevant site.

We will try to provide you with links to high quality, reputable sites which we believe will be of interest and relevant to you, but please note that such third party sites are not under our control and we do not contribute to the content of such sites.

Please see our [Security Policy ](https://web.archive.org/miscellaneous/security/security.jhtml)for further information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you have finished using a shared computer. 

**What choices do I have?**
