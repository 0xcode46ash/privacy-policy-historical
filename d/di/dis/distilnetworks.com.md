### The Information We Collect

  1. #### Information You Provide.

    1. (a) When you sign up at the Website for the Services you provide us with your contact information and payment information. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. We may also supplement the information you provide with information we receive from third parties.
    2. (b) When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Services.
  2. #### Site Information.

When you use the Services, we automatically receive, record and cache the content of your site, including, without limitation, documents, browsers, your IP address, cookie information, software and hardware attributes, usage information and other site properties.

  3. #### Transactional Information.

We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the Website. If you do not want us to store your payment source account information, please contact our privacy team to have it removed.

  4. #### Cookie Information.

We use “cookies” (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make the Website easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and the Company. For example, we use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Website. We also use cookies to confirm that you are logged into the Website, and to know when you are interacting with the Website and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies by using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Website.

  5. #### Clear GIFS.

We also employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”) that helps us better manage content on the Website by providing us feedback as to what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on a website page, web-based document or email message and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to confirm receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to other recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the “Opt-out” section below.

### How We Use the Information We Collect

  1. #### To Manage the Services.

### How the Information We Collect May Be Shared

  1. #### Promotional Partners.

We may from time to time use your personally identifiable information to provide promotional communications that we think may be of interest to you, including faxes and email to notify you of special offers and products and services as well as advertising from us or third parties. It is also possible that we may rent, sell or otherwise transfer your basic contact and product preference information to third parties who we think may offer services and products of interest to you. At any time, you can contact our privacy team at the address and email set forth above to request that we not provide you with promotional communications or share your basic contact and product preference information with third parties.

  2. #### Outside Contractors.

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers to support our services and products and the Website, such as hosting, monitoring and maintaining the Website, administering or monitoring emails, analyzing our visitors’ preferences, developing applications for the Website and providing general consulting services. These outside contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected from you, including your personally identifiable information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your personally identifiable information by these outside contractors is limited to the information we determine, in our sole discretion, to be reasonably necessary in order for them to perform their function for us. While we will seek to require outside contractors to protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information under a policy at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of outside contractors.

  3. #### Legal Compliance

We may disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect the Company’s rights or property.

  4. #### Business Transfers.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale or other transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information).

  5. #### Non-Private or Non-Personal Information.

We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as the types of bots, scrapers, and other automated malware found on websites generally over a period of time in order to provide a general sense of the prevalence of website corruption.




* * *

### Links and Advertising

From time to time, the Website may contain hyperlinks (“Links”) to third party websites as well as banner advertising and sponsorships operated by or referring to third parties and their goods and services (“Advertising”). Such Links and Advertising are for your reference only, and we neither control the privacy policies of such linked or advertised websites nor are we liable or responsible in any way for the use of any personally identifiable information that you may provide such sites. We recommend that you remain aware when you leave the Website and review the terms of use and privacy policies of each and every linked website.

You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in an email or other communications with any third party listed on the Website or in other materials, that information, along with any other information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by such third parties and may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from other persons. Such collection, correlation, use and messages are beyond our control.

* * *

### Security

  1. #### Steps we take to keep your information secure.

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to adequately safeguard and secure the information we collect on the Website from unauthorized access.

  2. #### Risks inherent in sharing information.

Notwithstanding our commitment to protect your information, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet. Additionally, there also is some risk our security systems could be circumvented or breached. As a result, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any questions regarding the security on the Website or of the Services you can contact our privacy team at the address and email set forth above.




##### How You Can Change or Remove Information

  1. #### Editing your information.

You are responsible for providing accurate information when registering with any portion of the Website that requires registration, or performing other functions that might require you to submit personally identifiable information to the Website. If you wish to correct any personally identifiable information you have provided to us, you may do so by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above.

  2. #### Deactivating or deleting your account.

If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. The account can only be deleted by providing notice to us through the Website. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to the Website. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from the Website. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.

  3. #### Backup copies.

Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies for up to 90 days, but will not be available to others.

### Opt-out

As noted above, you may at any time opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us and/or request that we discontinue providing your basic contact information to third parties by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above. Please note that if you decide to opt-out of receiving promotional information or request that we discontinue providing your basic contact information, your change in preference will only affect future contacts; if the information already has been provided to third parties, they may continue to use it.

Even if you choose to opt-out, we reserve the right to contact you as necessary in our sole discretion regarding any request you have made for our services or products and changes to this Privacy Policy and also to use, transfer, sell and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing the Website’s usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.
