# Privacy Policy - DIS

## Privacy Online

Your online privacy is important to us at DIS and we do not store information unnecessarily or ask for superfluous details. DIS does not share your personal information with anyone except for legal compliance, should such an instance arise, or to protect our rights.

 **Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:**  
DIS operates several web pages apart from the main website that you are currently on. These include: [www.twitter.com/StudyAbroadDIS](http://www.twitter.com/StudyAbroadDIS "DIS Study Abroad on twitter"), [www.facebook.com/StudyAbroadDIS](http://www.facebook.com/StudyAbroadDIS "DIS on Facebook"), [www.issuu.com/study-abroad-europe](http://www.issuu.com/study-abroad-europe "DIS Study Abroad Catalog on Issuu"), [www.flickr.com/photos/studyAbroadDIS](http://www.flickr.com/photos/studyAbroadDIS "DIS photos on flickr"), and [www.youtube.com/studyabroaddis](http://www.youtube.com/studyabroaddis "DIS - Danish Institute for Study Abroad on YouTube"). It is DIS policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

 **Website Visitors**  
Like most website operators, DIS collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. DIS’ purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how DIS’ visitors use its website.

DIS also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DIS does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

 **Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information**  
Certain visitors to DIS’ websites choose to interact with DIS in ways that require DIS to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that DIS gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. In each case, DIS collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with DIS. DIS does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related or application activities.

 **Aggregated Statistics**  
DIS may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, DIS may monitor the most popular pages on the dis.dk site. DIS may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, DIS does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

 **Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**  
DIS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on DIS’ behalf or to provide services available at DIS’ websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using DIS’ websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

DIS will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, DIS discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when DIS believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of DIS, third parties or the public at large.

If you have applied to DIS, submitted a pre-application form, requested a catalog, signed up for a newsletter, submitted a feedback or contact form or similar through the DIS website and have supplied your e-mail address, DIS may occasionally send you an e-mail or mail, and in rare occasions call you, to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with DIS.

Information submitted by the user in this manner is stored by DIS in a private database, accessible only to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that need to know that information in order to process it on DIS’ behalf or to provide services available at DIS’ websites, and have agreed not to disclose it to others. DIS takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

 **Cookies**  
A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. DIS uses cookies to help identify and track visitors, their usage of DIS website, and their website access preferences. DIS visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using DIS’ websites, with the drawback that certain features of DIS’ websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

 **Privacy Policy Changes**  
Although most changes are likely to be minor, DIS may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in DIS’ sole discretion. DIS encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
