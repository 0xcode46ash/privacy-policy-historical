# Privacy Policy | Disruptor Beam

## Privacy Policy

### Last updated: February 16, 2015

**YOUR USE OF DISRUPTOR BEAM’S SITES AND SERVICES IS SUBJECT TO YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY.**

Disruptor Beam Inc., (“Disruptor Beam,” “Us” or “We”) may provide games, applications, products and services (individually, a “Service”, and collectively, the "Services") via websites owned by Disruptor Beam (without limitation, http://DisruptorBeam.com) or through third-party services or networks (including, without limitation, Facebook and Kongregate), or distributed through third-party application stores such as the Apple App Store or Google Play, or other web sites and applications owned, operated, licensed or controlled by Disruptor Beam (the "Disruptor Beam Sites" or the “Sites”). This Privacy Policy applies to your use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, unless a particular Service contains or links to a separate Privacy Policy.

Disruptor Beam respects the privacy of its online visitors and users of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. Disruptor Beam recognizes the importance of protecting certain information collected from users and has adopted this Privacy Policy that guides how Disruptor Beam gathers, stores, and uses information provided from users through the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services as described below. This policy is current as of its last revision date indicated above.

#### Acceptance of Privacy Policy

If you use the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, you are accepting the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, and We will have the right to collect, use and disclose your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to have your information collected, used and/or disclosed in any of the ways described in this Privacy Policy, you must discontinue use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. Your continued use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services after We either notify you of the changes or generally post such changes on the Disruptor Beam Sites will constitute your acceptance of those changes.  Accordingly, please check back for the most current version before relying on any provisions in this Privacy Policy.

#### Collection, Use and Disclosure of Information

When you use any Service through a third party Social networking service such as Facebook, Kongregate, Apple GameCenter or Google Play (each, an “SNS”), you allow Disruptor Beam to access certain information from your profile for that SNS. The information you allow Disruptor Beam to access varies by Service and SNS, and it is affected by the privacy settings you and your friends establish at the SNS. You can control and find out more about these settings at the SNS where you play our games. For example, Disruptor Beam may access and store some or all of the following information, as allowed by you, the SNS and your preferences:

  * your first and last name
  * your profile picture or its URL
  * your user ID number, which is linked to publicly available information such as name and profile photo
  * the user ID numbers and other public data for your friends
  * the login e-mail you provided to that SNS when you registered
  * your physical location and that of your access devices
  * your gender
  * your birthday



By playing a Disruptor Beam game through an SNS, you are authorizing Disruptor Beam to collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy Policy any and all information that you agreed the SNS could provide to Disruptor Beam through the SNS Application Programming Interface.

When you interact with the Services (whether or not through an SNS), at any Disruptor Beam Site, We may collect and store information from you directly as described below.

Disruptor Beam may collect and share with other parties aggregate information and non-identifiable information gathered by Disruptor Beam in the course of your use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. "Aggregate information" is information that describes the habits, usage patterns, and demographics of users as a group but does not describe or reveal the identity of any particular user. "Non-identifiable information" is information about a user that is presented in a form distinguishable from information relating to other users, but not in a form that personally identifies contact and/or billing information for any user, or enables the recipient to communicate directly with any user unless agreed to by the user in advance of such communication. Aggregate information and/or non-identifiable information may be used by Disruptor Beam for any purpose, including, without limitation, to improve the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, for internal marketing studies, or simply to collect demographic information about Disruptor Beam's users.

Disruptor Beam may use contact information provided by users to send information about (i) Disruptor Beam and the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services for which you subscribed or otherwise used or accessed, including, without limitation, news about product updates, contests, events, and other promotional materials, and (ii) only if the users agree to receive such communications, for unrelated products or services. "Personally identifiable information" is information that permits a recipient to identify you as an individual, such as your name, mailing address, phone number, email address, and credit card information. While Disruptor Beam collects personally identifiable information on a voluntary basis for the use of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, Disruptor Beam's collection of personally identifiable information may be a requirement for access to certain parts of the Disruptor Beam Sites or Services. We may collect personally identifiable information from you from a variety of ways, including, without limitation, when you (a) make an online purchase from the Disruptor Beam Sites, (b) register to become a member or user of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, (c) voluntarily provide it when you use the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, (d) disclose it in a public area of the Disruptor Beam Site and Services, or (e) provide it when you communicate with Us.

If you make an online purchase or register to become a member or user of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, We may use the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with such purchase for shipping and billing purposes, to administer and manage your account, or provide promotional updates regarding such Disruptor Beam Sites and Services as contemplated above. In addition, We may send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical or security issues related to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services you requested, confirming you requested a product or service, or providing periodic updates or information relating to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services you requested. For so long as you are subscribed to or otherwise using or accessing a Disruptor Beam Site or Service, you will not be able to choose to unsubscribe from these mailings, as they are considered an essential part of the product or service you have chosen. Except in the cases described below, Disruptor Beam will not share personally identifiable information with any third-party unless the user agrees to such disclosure in advance.

We may provide the option to register to receive SMS notifications to your mobile phone regarding the Services that you use. If you sign up to have SMS notifications sent directly to your mobile phone We will receive and store the information you provide, including your telephone number. These messages may notify you of in-game activity and may allow you to use the Service from your phone. With your consent We may also send push notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant messages. You can manage push notifications from the “options” or “settings” page within the relevant Service. You may also be able to manage them from your device’s settings page for the relevant Service. We may send local notifications to your mobile device to provide game updates and other relevant information. You can manage local notifications from the “options” or “settings” page within the relevant Service.

Disruptor Beam may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including, without limitation, packaging, mailing and delivering purchases, answering customer questions about products or services, sending postal mail, providing billing and collection services, conducting customer surveys, and processing event registration. We will only provide these companies the information reasonably required to perform the applicable service, and they will be prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. When these companies collect and/or have access to the personally identifiable information you provide, We require that they protect the confidentiality of personally identifiable information they collect or have access to in the course of their engagement by Disruptor Beam. Also, in certain cases, your personally identifiable information may be collected directly by our authorized distributors, sublicensees or subcontractors in connection with certain products or services made available through web sites operated by such companies. In these cases, the privacy policies of such companies will apply rather than Disruptor Beam's policy. If providing the information is a requirement of usage, the user may elect to decline to use that particular product or service.

Disruptor Beam may elect to share personally identifiable information of users with certain business partners for marketing or other similar purposes, but only if the users agree to share such information. In such event, such partners will be prohibited from disclosing such information or using such information except for the limited purposes for which such users agree to share such information. Furthermore, third-party web sites and companies with links to and from the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services may collect personally identifiable information about users. You should be aware that these third-party web sites or links may have their own information collection practices and privacy policies. We do not control the privacy policies of third parties that have web sites linked to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. If you click on a third-party advertisement or link, the privacy policies of the third-party web site that you link to will govern the use of your information by that web site's operator. Disruptor Beam's Privacy Policy does not extend to these external web sites and companies. Please refer directly to these companies and web sites regarding their privacy policies. We assume no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties with respect to their use of your information or otherwise. Accordingly, please make sure you are aware of and comfortable with the privacy policies of any third-party web sites to which you follow a link.

Disruptor Beam may disclose your personally identifiable information or otherwise use such information to communicate with you if required or permitted to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process or any governmental request; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Disruptor Beam or its affiliated companies, licensors or licensees; (c) enforce the Terms of Service or any applicable License Agreements; or (d) protect the personal safety or interests of Disruptor Beam employees, users of Disruptor Beam products or services, or members of the public in urgent circumstances. We also may disclose your personally identifiable information to a third-party that alleges that you have infringed their intellectual property rights, subject to reasonable verification of such claims.

In the event of a merger or consolidation of Disruptor Beam, or the sale of all or a portion of its stock or assets, or the transfer of the operation and distribution of certain products or services to a third party, or bankruptcy of Disruptor Beam, your personally identifiable information may be transferred to Disruptor Beam's successors or assigns resulting from such events.

#### Children Under The Age of 13

Our Sites and Services are not intended for children under the age of 13 and We do not knowingly collect any personal information from such children. Children under the age of 13 should not use our Sites and Services at any time. In the event that We learn that We have inadvertently gathered personal information from children under the age of 13, We will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such information from our records. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers between the ages of 13 and 17 must have their parents review this policy and contact Us if they would like to opt out of receiving communications from Us or to remove personally identifiable information.

#### Use of Cookies and Other Information Stored on a User's Machine

Cookies are bits of electronic information stored on a user's hard drive to provide information needed by the user on a regular basis. They are often used to save web site customizations and web site login information.

We use third-party media management tools and services to deliver ads on our behalf across the Internet. Such third parties may also collect anonymous information about your visits the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. This is primarily accomplished through the use of anonymous cookies, and a technology device, commonly referred to as a Web Beacon or Action Tag, which We place on various pages within the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services and other online content or in e-mails, that allow such third parties to collect anonymous information. Such third parties may use information about your visits to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services and other websites in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you.

Disruptor Beam may use clear gifs, frames, server log analysis, and other technology to customize your experience with the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services. We will handle personal information collected through the use of these technologies according to this Privacy Policy. An IP address is a number that uniquely identifies your computer on the Internet. We may collect and store IP addresses for the purposes of providing our products and services, including, without limitation, system administration, troubleshooting, user compliance with our Terms of Service, investigating security breaches, and compiling aggregate information (such as how many visitors logged on to the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services). When you visit a particular web page on the Disruptor Beam Sites, our servers log your IP address. Disruptor Beam stores information on a user's hard drive that is used in conjunction with online play of Disruptor Beam products. For example, some user configuration settings for multiplayer game play, including the player name input by the user, may be uploaded to the server for online play. The player name along with current game play stats is displayed to other users during multiplayer game play or the related Disruptor Beam Sites. Users should be aware that this game play information disclosed during multiplayer game play is public information. Disruptor Beam will not disclose a user's personally identifiable information associated with such game play to other users except as permitted herein.

#### Chat Rooms/Forums

From time to time, Disruptor Beam may provide online chat (voice or text) rooms and/or forums to users. Any information that is disclosed in these chat rooms and forums is public information and users should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in such chat rooms and forums. If you voluntarily disclose information in a public area of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, such as a voice or text chat room or forum, that information may be collected and used by a third party to send you unsolicited messages, advertisements or for other purposes. We do not control the actions of these third parties in public areas of the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services, so if you disclose information in a public area, you do so at your own risk. Further, any communication (voice or chat) within any online game or any other communication feature within the Disruptor Beam Sites and Services (e. g. instant message services or voice), including without limitation, communications conducted "privately" with another person, go through Disruptor Beam's servers and any such communications that you send or receive may be monitored or recorded and stored by Disruptor Beam.

The Services support and may encourage interaction among players. In some Disruptor Beam Sites and Services your SNS friends may see your name, profile photo or descriptions of your game activity. In some Disruptor Beam Sites and Services other players may be able to see your Disruptor Beam account information, which may include your name or in certain cases may reveal your SNS ID. Access to a SNS ID may allow others to view the public information associated with your related SNS account, and other players may also be able to contact you through the related SNS’ communication channels.
