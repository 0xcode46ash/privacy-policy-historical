# Privacy Policy | MODUS

At MODUS, we respect and are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy lets you know how your personal information is processed and used. We promise that we will take steps to use your personal information only in ways that are compatible with this Privacy Policy.

## About the Safe Harbor Program

The “Safe Harbor” program was jointly established in June 2000 by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission, as a method for transferring personal information from the European Union (EU), to companies in the United States. The program is a voluntary self-certification process for companies operating in the United States. Companies that certify represent that  
they are upholding privacy standards for personal information received from the EU that have been jointly accepted by the EU Commission and the US Department of Commerce. These standards exceed current US privacy standards. “Personal Information” means information that can directly or indirectly lead to the identification of a living person, such as an individual’s name, address, e-mail, telephone number, license number, medical identification number, photograph, or other identifying characteristic. The identification can occur by reference to one or more factors specific to the individual’s physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity. Personal information does not include information that has been anonymized, encoded or otherwise stripped of its identifiers, or information that is publicly available, unless combined with other non-public personal information.
