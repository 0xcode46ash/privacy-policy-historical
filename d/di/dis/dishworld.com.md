What is Personal Information?

When Does Dish Digital Collect Personal Information?
        Dish Digital collects Personal Information from you when you
        voluntarily submit it to Dish Digital, for example, when you rent a

        By providing us with your Personal Information and other personally-
        identifiable information, you consent to our collection, use and disclosure


        of that information as described in this Privacy Policy as amended from
        time to time or as described at or before the time of collection, use or
        disclosure, as the case may be. Dish Digital is the owner of the Personal
        Information and other personally-identifiable information we collect from
        our Users. Dish Digital may share Personal Information and other
        personally-identifiable information with its affiliates. For purposes of this
        Policy, “affiliates” are entities that, directly or indirectly, control, are
        controlled by, or are under common control with Dish Digital. “Control”
        means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct, or to cause the direction
        of, the management and policies of an entity, whether through ownership
        of voting securities or equity interests, through common directors or
        otherwise. If you do not want your Personal Information or other
        personally-identifiable information to be collected, used or disclosed in
        accordance with this Privacy Policy, please do not submit your Personal
        Information or other personally-identifiable information to us. For

        please see the following section: How Can I Remove My Account
        Information and What Happens to My Personally Identifiable
        Information?
What Happens When I Register For the Service?
       In order to use certain features of this Service, a User must first complete
       a registration process. During registration a User is required to provide
       basic contact information (such as name and e-mail address) and
       establish a password. Depending on the feature being used, the User
       may be required to provide other information associated with the use of
       that particular feature.
Does Dish Digital Use Cookie Technology?
       Dish Digital uses cookie technology to make your use of the Service
       more convenient and to support our business. A cookie is a piece of
       information that is transferred to a User's hard drive for record-keeping
       purposes. For example, Dish Digital uses cookies to remember your e-
       mail address so that you will not have to re-enter this information each
       time you visit a Site. Dish Digital also uses cookies to help track referrals
       from third party Websites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept
       cookies, but you can set up your browser to alert you every time a cookie
       is offered, letting you decide whether or not to accept it. You can visit
       and use the Service with cookies disabled, but you will not automatically
       be recognized by the Service upon re-visiting. However, cookies allow
       you to take full advantage of some of our Service’s best features, so we
       recommend that you leave them turned on.
What Other Mechanisms Does Dish Digital Use to Track User Behavior?


      Some Service web pages and HTML-formatted e-mails and e-
      newsletters use web beacons to compile statistics about Website usage.
      A web beacon is an electronic image, called a single-pixel (1x1) or clear
      GIF. Web beacons can recognize certain types of information on a
      visitor's computer, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a
      page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is
      placed. You may render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their
      associated cookies.
      Dish Digital may use web beacons to track and analyze usage
      information and to compile statistical information about our Users in
      order to improve the Website's quality and performance. Dish Digital
      reserves the right to publish non-personally identifiable information
      regarding its Website visitors for promotional purposes and as a
      representative audience for business partners.
      We also collect information in log files that include data such as internet
      protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP),
      referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of
      clicks. We and our business partners use this information to analyze
      trends, administer the Service, track User's movement in the aggregate,
      and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP
      addresses, etc., are not linked to personally-identifiable information.
How Does Dish Digital Handle Information from Children?
       Please note that Dish Digital has no intention of collecting personally-
       identifiable information from individuals under the age of 13 ("children").
       As provided for in the Dish Digital On Demand Terms of Service,
       Users must be over the age of 18. Nonetheless, we are committed to
       protecting children's privacy on the Internet and we comply fully with the
       Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). Where appropriate,
       we will instruct children not to provide such information to us. If a parent
       becomes aware that a child has provided us with personally-identifiable
       information, we ask that the parent or legal guardian of the child contact
       us by sending an email to support@DishWorld.com. Dish Digital
       encourages parents to be involved in the media viewing and internet
       usage of their minor children. Parental controls allow you to restrict what
       your children watch/listen to based on content ratings. The availability of
       parental controls varies by Device manufacturer/provider. Please learn
       about Parental Controls provided by your Device by consulting your
       Device’s guide, manufacturer and/or provider.
How Does Dish Digital Use Personal Information?
      Dish Digital and its affiliates use Personal Information for our internal
      business purposes. We use the Personal Information you provide for the


      purposes for which it was provided, (for example, to process an order).
      In addition, Dish Digital and its affiliates may share and use Personal
      Information and other personally-identifiable information collected from
      you to administer and manage our business, including, for example, for
      account maintenance and in connection with information technology
      services. Personal Information and other personally-identifiable
      information also may be used to create a profile that we keep on
      individual Users that details their preferences and behavior. This profile
      may be used to develop and improve the products, benefits and services
      that Dish Digital and its affiliates offer to our Users to improve the
      Service and the associated user experience.
      Where permitted or required by law, Dish Digital may collect, use or
      disclose Personal Information without your consent, for example, in
      response to a court order or subpoena or to comply with a legally
      permitted inquiry by a government agency.
When Will I Be Contacted by Dish Digital?
      You may receive products and communications associated with your
      transactions with Dish Digital. You may also receive communications
      from Dish Digital related to transactions that appear to be from you or
      which appear to be fraudulent. You may be contacted regarding an issue
      on your account, in response to a customer service contact by you or in
      response to a specific request from you, for example, if you click on a
      "forgot my password" link. These administrative communications also
      may be accompanied by information about products and services,
      special offers and upcoming promotions or events offered by Dish
      Digital, our affiliates or our marketing partners that we think may be of
      interest to you ("direct marketing").
      You also may periodically receive from Dish Digital or its affiliates (if
      permitted by Dish Digital) unsolicited direct marketing communications
      by email. We support the option to not receive these types of
      communications. Please see the following section: How Can I Opt Out of
      Receiving Direct Marketing from Dish Digital? We will send standalone
      direct marketing e-mail communications to you only if you have agreed
      previously.

      may disclose to their business partners certain personally-identifiable
      information, such as names, mailing addresses, email addresses and the
      genre of products purchased by Users, so that the business partner may
      send their own direct marketing communications to Users. If you would
      prefer that Dish Digital and its affiliates not use or disclose your
      personally-identifiable information to unaffiliated business partners for
      their own direct marketing purposes, you may opt out of such disclosures
      by (a) checking the appropriate "Opt Out" box in any applicable e-mail

      and functions. Dish Digital will never send your password or your
      financial information to any third party through these features or
      functions.
      We periodically remove from the information collected about Users data
      that can be used to identify individuals, for example, by summarizing,
      aggregating or removing certain data elements. The resulting cleaned
      data is no longer considered Personal Information or personally-
      identifiable information and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. The
      cleaned data may be published by Dish Digital and provided to various
      third parties.
      If Dish Digital or its assets are acquired by another company, your
      Personal Information and other personally-identifiable information may
      be disclosed to the acquiring company to allow it to fulfill your order or
      provide the products, services or information that Dish Digital would
      otherwise provide to you and generally to carry on the Dish Digital
      business. We may also use and disclose your Personal Information and
      other personally-identifiable information to parties connected with the

      will be posted publicly, such as in a product review, your posting will be
      seen by others. In addition, if you elect to participate in certain
      community features offered from time to time, selected information about
      you, including information about your movie selections, may be shared
      with other participants in these community features. Also, Dish Digital
      may make it possible for certain third party websites to be accessed
      directly from our Websites and for selected information about you to be
      provided to these third party websites if you are also a user of these third
      party websites. If a third party Website allows other users to view
