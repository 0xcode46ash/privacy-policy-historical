Disney Online collects personally identifying information only during contest or sweepstakes registration and in certain portions of sites in which guests provide content submissions and suggestions or participate in interactive online activities (i.e., community postings, voting, chat, games, or bulletin boards). Disney Online may use such information to fulfill prizes or for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event Disney Online plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and given the option of preventing such posting.

Disney Online encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at Disney Online's Web sites by guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Disney Online does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever. Although guests under 13 years of age are allowed to participate in contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardians identified in the initial Registration process. No information collected from guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Disney.

If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use by e-mail request.

Disney Online collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers \-- the big computers that "serve" up Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. When guests request pages from Disney Online sites, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us.
