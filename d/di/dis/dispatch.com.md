# Dispatch Privacy Policy

* * *

The Columbus Dispatch respects the privacy of visitors to our Web site. We do not resell, trade or share any information provided by our visitors with any other entity. All information, other than information intended for publication, is confidential. Following is a list of types of information that may be recorded on our site and the purposes for which the information is used:

  1. **Cookies:** The Dispatch Web site sets cookies ([what is a cookie?](https://web.archive.org/web/19990429232704id_/http%3A//www.dispatch.com/legal/cookie.html)) to track unique viewings of advertisements. This helps us determine, for example, whether an ad has been viewed 10 times by one person or one time by 10 different people. No user information is saved or tracked as part of this effort. At other times we may set other cookies for different purposes on our Web site. If so, we will update this information to advise our visitors about the use of those cookies. Other sites that we link to from our pages may set their own cookies. The Dispatch has no control over these cookies, and we suggest you contact the site in question if you have concerns. One such site is the Dispatch-Bloomberg personal finance page, which uses cookies as passwords for users who wish to take advantage of the portfolio feature.  
It should be noted that cookies **cannot** in any event contain information other than that which you voluntarily provide. We cannot use cookies to directly determine any private information about you.
  2. **Guestbook:** We save guestbook entries as useful feedback from our visitors. We do not publish or share any information from the guestbook without consent of the author. All entries in the guestbook are voluntary. Because of the volume of entries, we cannot guarantee a response to any individual guestbook entry.
  3. **Letters to the Editor:** Letters to the Editor are presumed to be intended for publication. Identifying information provided with the letter is used only for verification of the letter's authenticity. Letter authors' real names, cities of residence, and title (where applicable) are published along with the letter. Due to the volume of letters we receive, we cannot guarantee either publication or a personal response to any given letter.
  4. **Advertising submissions:** Personal information provided with online classified advertising submissions is used only for verification and billing purposes.
  5. **Electronic mail to staff members and departments:** Staff members have broad discretion as to the handling of mail sent to their individual accounts. The company does not have a policy of tracking or recording such correspondence, except by the specific request of the staff member in cases such as harassment. Electronic mail sent to departments within The Dispatch, such as the Circulation Department, is handled at the department's discretion. The Dispatch does not have a policy of sharing contents of e-mail with any other entities. However, we reserve the right to disclose such correspondence as necessary to protect the company's legal interests.
  6. **Standard Web server log files:** All accesses to our Web servers are recorded by software standard to our Web server platform. Machine IP address, file accessed and time of access are recorded. This information is used only for system load and activity accounting. No user-based tracking records are kept.
