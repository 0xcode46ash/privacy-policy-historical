# Disconnect privacy policy

Disconnect is committed to protecting your privacy and collecting only the minimum amount of info necessary. This privacy policy applies to your use of the Disconnect software, database, and forum — all collectively referred to as “Services”. Your use of the Services indicates you agree to the terms of this policy.

#### Summary of our policy

Nothing in this policy contradicts the following statements:

  1. Disconnect collects your personal data only as necessary to carry out your intended use of the Services, or as explicitly agreed to by you.
  2. Disconnect doesn’t sell your data.
  3. Disconnect gives your data to law enforcement only when required after legal process is followed.
  4. Disconnect retains your personal data for less than one month after you terminate your use of the Services, except info you make public as part of our forum or other services.



#### Complete terms

**1\. We use your data to provide our services**

We use your info to enhance the Services as follows.

_The Disconnect site:_

Like most websites, we collect server-log info such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and inbound and outbound links to administer and enhance your use of our site.

_The Disconnect browser extensions:_

We don’t collect anything.

_The Disconnect DB and forum:_

To facilitate effective, secure interaction with our database and forum, we request and collect personally-identifiable info from users, including an email address and username. This info is used solely to allow users to access the sites and is completely deleted from our records upon request by the user. Our privacy database stores a username and IP address when a change is made to any data, but we provide the option of only recording the IP address to make potentially-sensitive updates anonymous. The IP address is temporarily stored to prevent spam or inappropriate changes or content but isn’t displayed publicly and is removed completely after three months.

_Disconnect communications:_

We use MailChimp to manage mailing lists and communications. We include no third-party tracking in messages we send other than what MailChimp may or may not include. MailChimp’s privacy policy is available at http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy.

**2\. We don’t sell your data to advertisers or other third parties**

We don’t receive payment in cash or in kind from third parties in exchange for your info. We also don’t allow third parties to track info about you through cookies or other means.

**3\. We share your data only in specific circumstances**

There are a few times when we must share your info either to protect our rights or to obey the law. We share your info only to:

  * comply with a subpoena or search warrant that’s been legally issued, or with any other legitimate government request we’re legally obligated to respond to;
  * enforce our own rights and contracts with users or third parties, like this privacy policy or our terms of use;
  * address a security or technical issue with our site; or
  * prevent harm to others and others’ property, especially in an emergency situation.



In all instances, we share the minimum info necessary to meet the immediate need.

**4\. We retain your data for 30 days or less after you request deletion**

We remove your info from our records within 30 days of a request to do so, except Disconnect retains the right to display any of your posts and comments on our forum or in conjunction with the Services.

#### Changes to this policy

Disconnect may make small, inconsequential changes to this policy with or without notice to you, so you’re encouraged to review this policy from time to time. Substantive changes to this policy will be emailed to users who provide their address on our homepage or forum.

#### Contact

You’re encouraged to contact us if you have any questions about this policy.
