# Privacy Policy - as it relates to Resellers and Clients - Distribute.IT

Effective April 1, 2005

Distribute.IT is committed to protecting your privacy and to comply with the current legislation covering the collecting, storing and distribution of the information we collect from you when you use our website facilities. This policy document outlines fully Distribute.IT's information gathering, usage and storage procedures [as required by the Privacy Act 1988 ('The Act')](http://www.privacy.gov.au/ACT/privacyact/ "Link will open in new window").

All information regarding you and your personal details will differ depending on the type of service/s you use as offered by us. The personal information will include name, contact details (including address, various types of phone numbers and your e-mail address), and other personal information as requested by us and supplied by you from time to time. We use this information to contact you, if required, about any issue that may arise when you use our services and to provide the highest levels of quality and support.

Full details of the information we request from you, including both mandatory and voluntary information types, can be seen when purchasing any service from us. Should you decide, after entering this information, that you do not wish to continue with the service, simply exit our website and we will not retain those details.

Distribute.IT collects your personal information in order to:

  * provision the services purchased 
  * invoice and collect payments 
  * identify you as a client when you request support 
  * keep you up to date with Distribute.IT's services 
  * provide accurate, timely support 



Distribute.IT will not request or collect details of an irrelevant or prejudicial nature unless it is considered necessary by law.

All SMS messages and phone numbers you enter will be recorded. This is due primarily for billing confirmation purposes and to enable you to create and maintain your 'phonebook' facility.

We also retain this information for future reference in the case of complaints and requests from authorities relating to complaints made directly to them about the content of messages sent/received.

It is a requirement of our Registrar Accreditation with ICANN to provide a Port 43 WHOIS service pertaining to certain domain name registrations. This WHOIS policy includes the requirement to provide public access to detailed Registrant details, including Registrant name, address, phone and email address.

When a .au domain name is registered, certain information is collected for use on the WHOIS service. The WHOIS service allows internet users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. Please see auDA's WHOIS policy at <http://www.auda.org.au/policies/auda-2006-06/> which sets out auDA's guidelines on the collection, disclosure and use of WHOIS data.

Our website uses two types of cookies â€” session generated (temporary) and permanent (albiet with an expiry date attached).

When you logon, a session cookie is created verifying who you are. This cookie resides in your computer memory and is deleted when you leave our website or by clicking on 'logoff' from the relevant menu. The only time a permanent cookie is placed on your computer is if you decide to use the 'remember me' facility when you login. This cookie helps speed the login process only. Under normal installation your web browser is set to accept cookies. However, it can be set to reject all cookies or warn you when a cookie is attempting to be lodged on your computer. In order for you to use our service you must allow the session generated cookie to be lodged. Should you decide not to accept cookies then you will be unable to use our services.

Each computer accessing the Internet is allocated an IP address. This is a unique sequence of numbers and is used to identify each individual computer. Under normal conditions the IP address is recorded when you visit our website. The recording of the IP address does not identify you personally, but it can be used to track an attempt to gain unauthorised access to our website services.

We may collect IP addresses or use 'cookies' to monitor your progress or usage patterns throughout the site.

We do not use any 'tracking' or 'monitoring' software that is either server or client based.

We do not disclose your personal information to parties outside Distribute.IT, except as required by current ICANN legislation (for international domain names only). However, please be aware that your information may be distributed to other current or future member companies of the Distribute.IT group. We would do this only to offer you targeted or special services. Presently we do not collect enough marketing information to accurately assess your interests or needs. We may do so in the future.

We will never sell, release, or make public, your personal information to a 3rd party, unless you have given us express written permission to do so, or unless we are required to by a law enforcement body with the proper jurisdiction authority.

You can, at any time, access and update your data via our website. Please note that if you give your login details to a 3rd party, such as a friend or relative, then they too will be able to view and update your information.

If a person requests access to an account, and they are not the listed contact, they will be required to prove in writing that they have permission from the account holder to access tha account holders information.

We adhere to strict standards in order to prevent unauthorised access to your personal information. In order to protect sensitive customer information from unauthorised access, modification, loss or other misuse, Distribute.IT employs secure databases utilising password protection and firewalls. All electronic data is stored on servers with daily backup procedures and located in physically secure environments.

By using our services you consent to Distribute.IT's collection and use of the information you supply us as specified in this Policy. Any changes to this policy will be published to this website and any other website owned or operated by Distribute.IT Pty Limited.
