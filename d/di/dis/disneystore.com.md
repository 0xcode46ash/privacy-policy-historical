# Disney Online's Privacy Policy and Internet Safety Information

Disney.com is committed to providing the best online family entertainment within a trusted environment. Privacy and safety issues are important to us, and to that end we're pleased to offer a variety of links to Internet resources.

The five links below should help make Internet surfing a fun and enjoyable experience for your entire family.

**THE INTERNET, PRIVACY, DISNEY ONLINE, AND THE GO NETWORK**

The Internet contains a wealth of information; unfortunately, it may also contain personal details about you that you don't want everyone to know. For example, your real name (lots of people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. At Disney Online and the GO Network we strive to help our customers protect their privacy while using our services. 

**DISNEY ONLINE AND THE GO NETWORK'S PRIVACY POLICY**

Disney Online and the GO Network's policy is to respect and protect the privacy of our users. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun experience and we want to help you make it so. 

The information you provide for your personal Disney Online Account is shared among the GO Network sites, as it is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. However, be assured that Disney Online and the GO Network will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent. Disney Online and the GO Network may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Disney Online and the GO Network's rights or property, other Disney Online and GO Network users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Disney Online and the GO Network may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

Disney Online and the GO Network share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we will say Disney Online's audience is x percent female and y percent male. This data is used to customize Disney Online and the GO Network content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users. 

There are cases where Disney Online may ask you for personal information such as your name, e-mail address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register for a Disney Online Account, for online shopping or transactions, or for services that require registration or subscription (for example Disney's Club Blast). Disney Online needs to collect this information for fulfilling prizes, tracking/verifying compliance with Disney Online and the GO Network policies as well as federal, state, and local laws, and/or for editorial and feedback solicitation purposes. 

In case you change your mind or some personal information changes (such as your ZIP code), we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update, or remove the personal data you give us. You can do this at the member information page or by contacting our Customer Support organization at [guest.mail@online.disney.com](mailto:guest.mail@online.disney.com?Subject=Please%20update%20my%20account%20information). 

**OPTING OUT**

Information provided at the time of Registration or submission from a Guest who is 13 years of age or over may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Disney Online, the GO Network, and our affiliates or companies that have been prescreened by Disney Online and the GO Network. To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt out of the following services: sharing your information in our member directory, receiving communications from Disney Online about new features or services, and receiving communications about offers from third-party companies that offer a product or service that we think would be of value to you. If a Guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use -- either by e-mail request to [guest.mail@online.disney.com](mailto:guest.mail@online.disney.com?subject=Request%20to%20opt-out%20of%20Member%20Registration%20Services) or by modifying his/her member information online. 

Information provided when purchasing products from any of our online stores may be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-out processes described on, or linked to, each order form. 

**POLICIES FOR KIDS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE)**

Disney Online and the GO Network encourage parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the activities offered on the sites. No information should be submitted to or posted at Disney Online and the GO Network by Guests under 13 years of age without the consent of their parent or guardian. 

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Disney Online and the GO Network do not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever from our Guests under 13 years of age. All registrants receive an e-mail confirming their Registration. In addition, when a Guest under 13 registers, he/she is required to provide the e-mail address of his/her parent or guardian and that parent or guardian receives an e-mail alerting them to that Registration. Since all of Disney Online's free interactive activities are monitored by community policy experts, registered Guests under 13 years of age may participate in such activities upon Registration, unless their parent or guardian asks that their registration be invalidated. In order for the potential Member to use the GO Network interactive services, the parent or guardian must validate the account, as described in the e-mail. No information collected from Guests under 13 years of age is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Disney Online and the GO Network except as explicitly stated during registration for contests or promotions (and in that case, the information collected is used only for the specific contest or promotion). 

Although Guests under 13 years of age may be allowed to participate in some contests and promotions, if such a Guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian identified in the initial registration process. Publication of names, ages, or images for contest winners under 13 require parental or guardian consent. 

We do not allow Guests under 13 years of age to be listed in our Member directory or to receive direct marketing communications from Disney Online and the GO Network or to be sent third-party offers. 

**POLICIES FOR TEENS (INDIVIDUALS 13 TO 17 YEARS OF AGE)**

Teens are required to provide the e-mail address of a parent or guardian and a notification message is sent to the parent or guardian of all Guests who are 13 to 17 years of age, which identifies the information supplied at Registration and allows the parent or guardian to be aware of and participate in the Guest's online experience. 

**USE OF IP ADDRESSES**

An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

Disney Online and the GO Network collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When Guests request pages from Disney Online and the GO Network sites, our servers log the Guests' IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. 

Some services within Disney Online and the GO Network, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information you are comfortable with sharing. 

**USE OF COOKIES**

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when Guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users needs. 

Disney Online and the GO Network have two primary uses for their cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. For example, in GO Network's News Center, users can specify keywords across several news categories. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about the kinds of news stories you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of the Disney Online and the GO Network service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to Disney Online and the GO Network always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Information from cookies is sometimes attached to messages sent to our Customer Service department 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of the Disney Online and the GO Network service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing shopping transactions, entering contests, or playing games. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Disney Online and the GO Network do not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**

Users should be aware that when they are on Disney Online and the GO Network, they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Disney Online and the GO Network pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you "click" on a banner advertisement or a Disney Online search result, the "click" takes you off the Disney Online site. This includes links from advertisers, Center sponsors, and partners that may use Disney Online or the GO Network's logo as part of a co-branding agreement. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While Disney Online and the GO Network strive to protect their users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online and you do so at your own risk. 

Disney Online and the GO Network's policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond Disney Online and the GO Network's control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation. 

**SECURITY**

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our Guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, Disney Online and the GO Network can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. 

Your Disney Online and GO Network Account is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Disney Online and the GO Network will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. 

Remember to sign out of your Disney Online or GO Network Account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café. 

**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS**

By using this site, you signify your assent to the Disney Online and the GO Network Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our sites. Your continued use of the Disney Online and GO Network sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
