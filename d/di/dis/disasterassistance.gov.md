# Privacy Policy | DisasterAssistance.gov

Thank you for visiting DisasterAssistance.gov and reading our privacy policy.

We take the security of your personal information very seriously, and make every effort to protect your privacy under federal law.

  * ## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

PII includes personal details that may be used to identify you. If you enter PII on our site, it's only used for the purpose you enter it for, and is protected by the [Privacy Act of 1974](http://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacyact1974.htm), the [E-Government Act of 2002](http://www.it.ojp.gov/default.aspx?area=privacy&page=1287#contentTop) and the [Federal Records Act](http://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/laws/).

  You don’t have to provide PII to visit our site, or answer the questionnaire. If you complete an online registration, you're asked to share PII that is used mostly to determine if you qualify under a declared disaster.

  You may give us PII when you ask for information or send an email, but we never ask for PII through email, and never collect information to use for marketing.

  FEMA may review data internally for quality control purposes. But we only share your PII with another government agency if your request relates to that agency. Then only with your permission or as required by law.

  To learn more, see the privacy documents below:

  * ## Children's Privacy

Some areas of our site have helpful disaster-related content for children, and we’re committed to following the [Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title15/html/USCODE-2011-title15-chap91.htm) (COPPA). If a child under 13 sends a question or comment, we only use their email address to respond to the message and delete it by our records retention policy. We don’t collect personal information from children under 13.

  To learn more, please email [FEMA-Privacy@fema.dhs.gov](mailto:FEMA-Privacy@fema.dhs.gov).

  * ## How We Use Cookies

We use cookies on our site as a tool to help our visitors. But we don’t use them to collect any PII from you or track actions beyond our site.

  A cookie is small file put onto your device when you connect to our website. It’s like an ID card for your device. It opens a “session” that allows data to be shared between our site and that device. In an active session, we can give you the information you want and help you view our pages easier.

  Cookies allow us to track certain data, like how you move through our site, what you look at or download, and browser behavior.

  There are two types of cookies: session and persistent. Session cookies are temporary. The cookie goes away and your session ends when your browser is closed. Persistent cookies are stored on a device for a longer time and used to identify that device each time you visit. Persistent cookies can also tell us how often you come back to visit.

  We use both types of cookies for different things:

    * 1-day persistent cookies on the questionnaire page
    * 3-month persistent cookies for site visits from a PC
    * Session cookies for site visits from a mobile device

 

You can also choose not to accept cookies. This won’t change what you can see on the site.

  To do this you may need to adjust the cookie settings on your Internet browser. If you use multiple browsers, you’ll need to do this in all of them. You can also delete cookies at any time through the browser Options tab.

  If you choose not to accept cookies and you answer the questionnaire, just be aware that your answers won’t be saved when you leave the page. You’ll need to answer the questions again.

  Visit USA.gov for [opt-out instructions](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml) for common browsers.

  * ## Google Analytics

Google Analytics is a tool the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has set up on DisasterAssistance.gov. This tool helps us gather data about actions and traffic on our site.

  To get the data, Google puts a 3-month persistent cookie on your device. The cookie is sent automatically, but you can choose not to accept it. This won’t change what you can see on the site. You can also delete cookies at any time through your browser’s Options tab.

  If you choose not to accept cookies and you answer the questionnaire, just be aware that your answers won’t be saved when you leave the page. You’ll need to answer the questions again.

  Visit USA.gov for [opt-out instructions](http://www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml) for common browsers.

  If you allow the cookie, it records non-identifiable data like:

    * Your Internet provider including location information
    * Session connection speed
    * Address of any website used to link to our site
    * Pages you visit and content downloaded
    * Count of unique visits to a page and the site
    * Time spent on a page and the site

 

The cookie sends data to Google’s system which immediately compiles it, but it doesn’t monitor or record your actions after you leave our site.

  We only see data for specific time-periods, and the data is kept only as long as required by our records retention policy. This data is used internally and may be shared with our partners and contractors to help us make improvements to the site.

  Google Analytics doesn’t tell us who you are or allow us to get your identity. Google never has access to the details of your session including PII entered on the application, and we don’t share our compiled data with them.

  To learn more about DHS’s use of Google Analytics, see [Google Analytics](http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_dhs_ga.pdf) DHS/ALL/PIA-033 (June 9, 2011).

  * ## AddThis

AddThis is a social bookmarking tool that allows visitors to share links from DisasterAssistance.gov to social media sites. This tool gathers data like browser type, operating system and the social site you used.

  We don’t use cookies with this tool, and the data we get is used internally to help us improve the site. AddThis doesn’t store any PII about you, like the login to your social media account. It doesn’t tell us who you are or allow us to get your identity.

  Just be aware that clicking on AddThis will take you away from our site. When you go to another website, you’re subject to the policies of that site. See the [AddThis privacy policy](http://www.addthis.com/privacy?utm_source=mf&utm_medium=link&utm_content=AT_privacy_MF15PC&utm_campaign=AT_privacy).

  To learn more about how FEMA uses AddThis, see [Use of Social Networking Interactions and Applications Communications/Outreach/Public Dialogue](http://www.dhs.gov/xlibrary/assets/privacy/privacy_pia_dhs_socialnetworkinginteractions.pdf) DHS/ALL/PIA-031 (September 16, 2010).

  * ## SurveyMonkey

We use SurveyMonkey online surveys to get feedback from a random sample of visitors. You can also give us feedback anytime by taking the survey at <https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/DisasterAssistance>. We read and compile the survey data, and use it internally to help make site improvements based on visitor needs.

  The survey doesn’t collect PII and you don’t have to take it. If you decline, it won’t change how the site looks or functions.

  *   * ## Visiting Linked Websites

Our site has links to some private and commercial organizations. These sites are not within our control and may not follow the same federal polices required for federal websites. Be aware that when you go to another website, you are subject to the policies of that site.
