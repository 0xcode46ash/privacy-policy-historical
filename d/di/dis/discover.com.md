 ****

  
A1: We collect various forms of information in various ways:

 **Information You Provide**

When you request information from Discover Magazine on Discover.com, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information about yourself and other members of your household. When this Privacy Policy uses the term “personally identifiable information,” we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s first and last name, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.”

You will always know when Discover.com collects personally identifiable information because you will have to supply that information to us or give your permission for us to collect that information. Typically, this information includes your name, postal address, and e-mail address. When you subscribe to Discover Magazine or sign up for Discover.com membership we may request additional personal information from you, such as credit card information and shipping information. Again, you will know when we collect this additional information from you because you will have to provide it to us.   


**Information Collected From You With Technology**

Discover.com uses information collected through technology to make our Web site(s) more interesting and useful to you. In some circumstances, it may not be readily apparent to you that such information is being collected. For instance, when you come to Discover.com, your IP address is collected. An IP address is often associated with the portal through which you enter the Internet, like your ISP (Internet service provider), your company, or your university. Standing alone, your IP address is not personally identifiable. 

At times we also collect information regarding the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of Discover.com and where on our Web site(s) they visit, as well as information regarding our visitors’ responses to e-mails that we send to them. We may combine the information collected from you with technology, including your IP address, with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to provide relevant content, ads, and e-mails to that visitor, as well as to enforce compliance with our Rules and Terms of Service, and to protect our service, Web site(s), visitors, and other parties.   


**What Are Cookies and Web Beacons, and How Does Discover.com Use Them?**

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web site to remember important information that will make your use of that site more efficient. Web site operators use cookies for a variety of purposes. For instance, when you return to Discover.com, cookies enable that site to remember who you are, so you don’t have to log in again. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many features that make your Web experience smoother, like the features mentioned above, and some of the services of Discover.com may not function properly.   
****

Discover.com also may use Web beacons (which are also known as clear GIFS). Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in images on the pages of Web sites. We may use Web beacons to send cookies to your computer. We also may use Web beacons to analyze the traffic patterns on our Web site(s), such as the frequency with which our users visit various parts of our Web site(s). The Web beacons on Discover.com may send data either directly from us or from another party authorized by us, and these Web beacons may transmit information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. This information is not collected, however, in a form that is personally identifiable. In addition, we use Web beacons in HTML e-mails that we send our members, in order to determine whether our members have opened those e-mails. This information may be gathered in a form that is personally identifiable. Finally, network advertisers who place advertisements on our Web site(s) may also use Web beacons in accordance with their privacy policies, as described in A3 below. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our Web site(s), and this information may permit us to determine the identity of other sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser.   


**Information Collected From Other Sources**

At times, we may supplement the record of a visitor to Discover.com (or the record of a subscriber to Discover.com) with data from third parties in order to determine a potential subscriber’s creditworthiness, as well as to serve our visitors and subscribers by providing, among other things, relevant content, ads, and e-mail and postal mail promotional materials. This third-party data may be either general demographic information or information specific to our individual visitors and subscribers. For example, with respect to general demographic information, there are companies that infer a consumer’s preferences based on the consumer’s zip code. With a zip code, these companies can generally infer home ownership, vacation choices, television viewing habits, and similar characteristics. With this additional information, we can then better customize our content, ads, and e-mail based on these inferred characteristics. Discover Magazine will hold and use the information that it collects from other sources in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Finally, Discover Magazine may collect information from the other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company. 

**Q2: How do we use the personally identifiable information that we have collected?**

A2: Discover Magazine uses personally identifiable information that it has collected in a number of ways. One of the ways we use such information is to send you updates and provide you information about Discover.com. We also use your personal information to complete transactions, such as processing orders for Discover.com. If you contact us for help, we will use the information to respond to you. We also use the information you provide to send you e-mail and postal mail promotions regarding our products and services, as well as products and services of other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and third parties, unless you have elected not to receive these promotions and offers. 

**Q3: How do we share information with other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and with businesses that are not part of The Walt Disney Company?**

A3: We share your information in various ways: 

**Companies That Are Involved in Providing Discover.com**

Various companies work with us to provide Discover.com. Other companies help us fulfill your subscription orders and process your requests concerning Discover.com, or help us communicate with you or assist us in gathering your information. Except as otherwise permitted by other provisions of this Privacy Policy, all of these companies are allowed to gather, receive, and use your information, but only for purposes connected with Discover.com. 

**Other Subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and Third Parties**

We may share the personal information you provide us with other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and/or other third parties so that they may send you e-mail and postal mail regarding their products or services, unless you have elected not to receive such promotions and offers. When we share your personal information under any circumstance described in this "Other Subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and Third Parties" section, your personal information will become permanently subject to the information use and sharing practices of the other subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company or third party, and the other subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company or third party will not be restricted by this Privacy Policy with respect to its use and further sharing of your personal information.

 **Sale of Business**

In the event that Discover Magazine is sold, the personal information of customers and potential customers of Discover Magazine, including subscribers to Discover.com, likely would be transferred to the buyer of Discover Magazine (including Discover.com). In that event, Discover Magazine will include provisions in the selling contract to require the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner you requested under this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In addition, Discover Magazine will give notice to individuals whose information is affected by the sale, in accordance with the procedures described in A7 below. 

**Disclosures Required By Law and Disclosures to Help Protect the Security and Safety of Our Visitors and Our Web Site(s)**

We may disclose personally identifiable information concerning you to a law enforcement agency pursuant to a warrant issued under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, an equivalent State warrant, a grand jury subpoena, and certain court orders. To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose personally identifiable information concerning you in order to enforce our Terms of Service, our Web site rules, and to protect the safety and security of our Web site(s), ourselves, and others. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

In addition to sharing personally identifiable information as described above, we may take your personally identifiable information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). Given the nature of this information, there are no restrictions under this Privacy Policy upon our right to aggregate or de-personalize your personal information, and we may use and/or share with others the resulting non-personally identifiable information in any way.

 **Third Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers**

Advertisements on our Web site(s) may be managed and placed on our Web site(s) by third parties. These companies are called “network advertisers.” Network advertisers who place these advertisements may also use cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information when you click on or move your cursor over one of their banner advertisements. You may not realize this information is being collected. In some cases, we may have access to information from Web beacons and cookies used by network advertisers on our Web site(s) and this information may permit us to identify other Web sites that you have visited that are also associated with the network advertiser. Finally, once you’ve clicked on an advertisement and have left our Web site(s), our Privacy Policy no longer applies and you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their Web site. To ensure our visitors’ privacy, we allow advertising on Discover.com from only those companies that have their own privacy policy. Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left Discover.com, this Privacy Policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their Web site.

 **Q4: What type of security do we provide?**

A4: The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our customers and potential customers is of great concern to us. Discover Magazine takes technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web, so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. 

**Q5: How can I access and update my account information and opt-out choices online?**

A5: The following methods are available to access and update your account information online (including opting out of certain uses and sharing of your personal information for promotional purposes):

a) If you are a subscriber to Discover Magazine, simply click on this link [Discover Customer Care](https://w1.buysub.com/pubs/G4/DCR/DCR_New_EmailEntryForm.jsp?cds_page_id=3097&cds_mag_code=DCR&id=RpOpOII) and then enter your e-mail address and follow the instructions. Subscribers can also contact us via e-mail at _[DCRcustserv@CDSfulfillment.com](mailto:DCRcustserv@CDSfulfillment.com)_. Please include the level of personal information in your e-mail or online request or inquiry that will help us identify your account so we can assist you.

b) Registered members of discover.com who wish to change their personal information or opt-out of certain uses by us of such information (e.g., receiving e-mail notices from Discover.com, including the Discover.com Newsletter and Topic Alerts) should do the following: log in to Discover.com; select “My Discover”; click on “Edit My Membership Details”; and edit the information or check the appropriate boxes.

If you are both a subscriber to Discover Magazine and a registered member of Discover.com, you must utilize both of the methods described in this paragraph to ensure that your request or preferences will be fully implemented.

 **Q6: Whom do I contact with questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy?**

A6: If you need further assistance, please send an e-mail with your questions or comments to _[privacyconcerns@discover.com](mailto:privacyconcerns@discover.com)_ or write us at: Discover Magazine, 114 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10011. 

**Q7: How will you know if we amend this Privacy Policy?**

A7: We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by sending you an e-mail at the last e-mail address that you gave us, and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on Discover.com. Any material changes to this Privacy Policy will be effective upon the earlier of ten (10) calendar days following our dispatch of an e-mail notice to you or thirty (30) calendar days following our posting of notice of the changes on Discover.com. Changes to this Privacy Policy may affect our use, and use by other companies, of personal information that you gave us prior to our notification to you of the changes. If you do not wish to permit changes in our use of your personal information, you must notify us prior to the effective date of the changes that you wish to close your account with us.

 **Privacy Policy**

 **for**

 **Buena Vista Magazines, Inc.**

 **Effective Date: January 1, 2005**

This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions regarding our privacy practices and principles. Buena Vista Magazines, Inc., an indirect subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, publishes Discover, Disney Adventures, Disney Magazine and FamilyFun. Buena Vista Magazines, Inc. is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “we,” “us,” “our” and “ourselves.” In keeping with the traditions of The Walt Disney Company, we refer to our customers as “guests.” When this Privacy Policy uses the term “personally identifiable information,” we mean information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. When other information, such as, for example, consumer product preferences, or number of children, is directly associated with personally identifiable information, this other information also becomes personally identifiable information for purposes of this Privacy Policy. Personally identifiable information is sometimes referred to in this Privacy Policy as “personal information.” Finally, the terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

 **Scope of Privacy Policy**

 _Q1 What information does this Privacy Policy cover?_

A1 This Privacy Policy applies to all personally identifiable information that we collect, on or after the effective date of this Privacy Policy, from individuals who provide us such information for the purpose of obtaining from us a product or service primarily for personal, family or household purposes. This Privacy Policy also applies to all personally identifiable information that we obtain from the Walt Disney Internet Group (“WDIG”), on or after the effective date of this Privacy Policy.

 **Information We Collect Offline**

 _Q2 What types of personal information may we collect offline?_

A2 We may collect offline various types of personal information. For example, we may receive personal information that comes directly from guests who are interested in obtaining various products and services from us. This information may include the guest’s name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. We also may collect other types of information such as gender, age, number of children, and personal interests, which we may associate with personal information. If you purchase products or services from us, we may note, for example, credit card information, the type of services or products ordered or purchased, and the date of the order or purchase. In addition, we may collect personal information from you if you participate in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers. Finally, we may supplement personally identifiable information that we have collected directly from our guests with other information that we obtain from third parties and other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company. In addition, when we associate information that we obtain from third parties or other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company with personally identifiable information that we have collected under this Privacy Policy, we will treat the acquired information like the information that we collected ourselves and, except as permitted by this Privacy Policy, the information will not be shared with third parties.

 _Q3 How may we use and share your personal information that we collect offline?_

A3 We may use and share your personal information collected offline under this Privacy Policy in a variety of ways, including, for example: ****

· We may send you promotional materials, and we may share your personal information with other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company and third parties so that they can send you promotional materials. (By “promotional materials,” we mean communications that directly promote the purchase of products or services.) These promotional materials may concern our products and services, and/or the products and services of another subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company or a third party. These promotional materials may be sent to you by postal mail, e-mail or other means. ****

· We may use your personal information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials. For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications about any account you may have with us or about future changes to this Privacy Policy. ****

· We may take your personal information and make it non-personally identifiable, either by combining it with information about other individuals (aggregating your information with information about other individuals), or by removing characteristics (such as your name) that make the information personally identifiable to you (de-personalizing your information). We may use this non-personally identifiable information for, among other purposes, research and analysis to improve our products and services. ****

· We may hire companies to help deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package or a company that helps fulfill prizes for a sweepstakes. In those instances, there is a need to share your information with these companies. Sometimes we also may work with other companies who help either gather your information or communicate with you. ****

· We may disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures (a) are required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help to: enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions and/or game rules; protect your safety or security, including the safety and security of property that belongs to you; and/or protect the safety and security of us, other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company, and/or third parties, including the safety and security of property that belongs to us, other subsidiaries of The Walt Disney Company or third parties. ****

· We may sell part or all of our business, and your personally identifiable information may be transferred as a part of the sale. In the event that we sell a business, we will include provisions in the selling contract requiring the purchaser to treat your personally identifiable information in the same manner required by this Privacy Policy (including any amendments to this Privacy Policy). In light of this protection, your opt-out choices under A4 will not affect our right to transfer your information to a purchaser in these circumstances. ****
