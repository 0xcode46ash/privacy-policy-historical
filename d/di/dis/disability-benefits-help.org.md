**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Social Security Disability Help website. On some pages, you can complete a free, online evaluation to be contacted by a disability attorney or advocate regarding your claim. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Phone number(s)
  * Date of Birth
  * Case Description
  * General Information about your disability claim.



**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information provided when completing an evaluation to assist with a potential legal claim. We share this information with attorneys or advocates so that they can evaluate the needs of the claimant. There is no cost for this evaluation. 

We or third parties may use the information provided to contact the claimant with tips about his/her case, in addition to sending newsletters and offers for products or services. The information provided may also be used to facilitate and conduct market research or for other survey purposes. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to learn more about visitors to our website. For example, we may find out that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

**Cookies and Web Beacons**

We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. 

**Changes**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy and our related business practices at any time by updating the text on this site. If any change to this Privacy Policy affects the way we use personal information, you will be provided with a method to opt out.
