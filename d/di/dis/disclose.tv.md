You may update, correct or delete information about you at any time by logging into your online account. If you wish to delete or deactivate your account, please email us at [support@disclose.tv](mailto:support@disclose.tv) or via our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/contact), but note that we may retain certain information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes. We may also retain cached or archived copies of information about you for a certain period of time.

Location Information

When you first launch any of our mobile applications that collect location information, you will be asked to consent to the application's collection of this information. If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. You may also stop our collection of location information by following the standard uninstall process to remove all of our mobile applications from your device.

 **Cookies**

Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our Service.

 **Promotional Communications**

You may opt out of receiving promotional emails or text messages from Disclose.tv by following the instructions in those emails or text messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations.

 **Special Note About Children**

Disclose.tv is not intended for children, especially kids under 13. Children may use Disclose.tv only with the direct supervision of their parent. We do not seek to collect personal information about children under 13 years of age through Disclose.tv. If we discover such information, we will delete it. Thus, we typically retain no information about children. However, if a parent requests a review of information we may have on their child and in the unlikely event we still retain such information and haven’t deleted it, then we will honor that request.

In order to request a review or deletion of personal information that Disclose.tv may have collected about your child, please email us at [support@disclose.tv](mailto:support@disclose.tv) or contact us [here](https://web.archive.org/contact).

When you communicate with Disclose.tv, we make every effort to ensure your privacy and safety. As an added precaution, however, we still encourage parents to monitor their child’s use of the Internet, and to help us protect their privacy by reminding them never to exchange personal information with this or any other web site without the assistance or express written permission of a parent or other responsible adult.
