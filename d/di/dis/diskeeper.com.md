## Privacy of Personal Data Policy and Explanation

  


### Security

  
Condusiv Technologies Corporation has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information. We take stringent precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration or destruction. We do not sell or give away information obtained from customers and prospective customers. We do however, work closely with our resellers and distributors to ensure that prospective customers in territories outside of the USA, which are not handled in-house, are responded to by the appropriate Condusiv Technologies reseller. 

### Enforcement

  
If for some reason you believe Condusiv Technologies has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at [privacy@condusiv.com](mailto:privacy@condusiv.com), and we will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain that the words Privacy Policy are in the subject line.

### Notice

  
To customize our site to your needs, we will initiate a one-time only request for information from you when you attempt to access a customizable section of our web site. Information collected includes your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, company name, type of business, number of employees and job title. Such data will enable us to identify you each time you enter our site and provides us with some marketing demographic data. This information is provided through a [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/account.aspx) when you first attempt to download freeware or trial evaluation software, subscribe to Email newsletters or sign up for field testing. We utilize your personal information for these three purposes: 

  * To make the site easier for you to use by not having to enter information more than once.
  * To help us create content most relevant to you.
  * To alert you to product upgrades, special offers, updated information and other new services from Condusiv Technologies.



### Cookies

  
Like most websites, we use cookie technology to collect website usage date to help improve our site and help to personalize your user experience. A cookie is a small data file of letters and numbers that is stored directly on the computer you are using. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Condusiv Technologies and our third-party service providers (including Google, Display Advertising and Remarketing service providers) use first party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to keep you informed of new products and/or trial evaluation software and to facilitate site navigation and personalize your experience. Cookies allow us to: 

  * Offer you more relevant products and services.

  * Collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our site and pages visited.
  * Monitor viewing and responses to Condusiv Technologies advertisements.

Our site uses both session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how you interact with our site and with any products or promotions we provide via the site, to monitor aggregate usage by our users and web traffic routing on the site, and to improve usability and performance of the site. A session cookie enables certain features of our site and our product offerings and is deleted from your computer when you disconnect from or leave our site. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to our site.

### Consent

  
If you decide to register or provide personal information, you will be able to select the types of information you want to receive from Condusiv Technologies. If you do not want Condusiv Technologies to communicate with you about other offers regarding Condusiv products, new software, events, or services by Email, postal mail or telephone, you may deselect the appropriate option.

### System Monitoring

  
System Monitoring is an optional feature offered within Condusiv products that allows users to anonymously share their user experience for the purpose of helping Condusiv Technologies Corporation improve future products. System Monitoring allows for the collection of information about your system environment with respect to resources impacted by the general function and use of your system. Information collected through the use of this feature will be used to generate a report to present this data about your system. Providing this information will help Condusiv Technologies to design future products to improve the use of your system. Information collected or provided to Condusiv Technologies does not include any personal or private information. 

### Access

  
We will provide you with the means to ensure that your personal information is correct and current. You may review and update this information at any time at the [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.aspx) page.

### Electronic Product Registration

  
When you buy and install a new product, we will offer you the option to register your purchase online. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can visit the [User Profile](https://web.archive.org/profile/profile.aspx) page, click on Update Profile, and edit any of the personal information in your profile. If you haven't already created a user profile, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.  
As mentioned above, every registered customer has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

When you register, we send this information number back to your hard drive in the form of a cookie, which is a very small bit of code. This code is uniquely yours, allowing you to download freeware and evaluation software and order free newsletters without having to resubmit information. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just use your User Name and Password to identify yourself.
