Certain Software may provide information, including Personally Identifiable Information that Certain Software collects, to such third party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information and services. These third party service providers are obligated to protect your Personally Identifiable Information on Certain Software's behalf, and to comply with this Privacy Policy.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Certain Meetings™ services, we will collect registration information for events. After completing registration, your information is transferred to the event organizer and becomes the responsibility of the meeting planner and event organizer. The registration data that we collect is the property of the contracted organization at all times. Certain Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of meeting planners and event organizers who are our clients.

When we collect your Personally Identifiable Information, we will provide a means for you to opt-out of Certain Software's sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners.

Even if you opt-out of such uses, you understand and consent to Certain Software's sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with third party payment processors, solely for the purposes of processing your payment for the Certain Meetings services.

For attendees, if you decide to use Certain Software's Certain Meetings services we will only send e-mail messages directly relating to registrations, including:

  * Confirmation of completed registration
  * Notice of incomplete registration
  * Additional information about the event or your registration



We do not allow users to elect not to receive these messages, because they are vital to completing the registration process.
