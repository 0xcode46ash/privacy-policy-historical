  5. For the same reason, we may obtain information about your general internet usage by using a cookie file which is stored on the hard drive of your computer.

**More About Cookies**

A cookie is a small file, typically of letters and numbers, downloaded on to a device when the user accesses certain websites. Cookies allow a website to recognise a user's device. 

**Session and persistent cookies**

Cookies can expire at the end of a browser session (from when a user opens the browser window to when they exit the browser) or they can be stored for longer. 

Session cookies - allow websites to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping basket as they browse around a site. They could also be used for security when a user is accessing internet banking or to facilitate use of webmail. These session cookies expire after a browser session so would not be stored longer term. For this reason session cookies may sometimes be considered less privacy intrusive than persistent cookies. 

Persistent cookies- are stored on a users' device in between browser sessions which allows the preferences or actions of the user across a site (or in some cases across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes including remembering users' preferences and choices when using a site or to target advertising. 

We use a cookie to remember your cookie preferences this has a couple of consequences: 

    1. If you delete all your cookies you will have to update your preferences with us again. 
    2. If you use a different device, computer profile or browser you will have to tell us your preferences again. 

The following cookies are used on this Website: 

    1. Strictly necessary 
    2. Performance 
    3. Functionality 
    4. Targeting 
    5. 3rd Party

**Strictly necessary**

“Strictly Necessary” cookies let you move around the website and use essential features like secure areas, shopping baskets and online billing. These cookies don't gather any information about you that could be used for marketing or remembering where you've been on the internet. 

We use these Strictly Necessary cookies to... 

    1. Remember things like information you've entered on order forms when you navigate to different pages in a single web browser session 
    2. Remember the goods and services you ordered when you get to the checkout page 
    3. Identify you as being logged in to our Website 
    4. Make sure you connect to the right service on our website when we make any changes to the way the website works

    2. Remember your preferences or username beyond your current visit 

Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the website, so if you prevent these cookies we can't guarantee your security or predict how our website will perform during your visit. 

**Performance**

“Performance” cookies collect information about how you use our website e.g. which pages you visit, and if you experience any errors. These cookies don't collect any information that could identify you - all the information collected is anonymous and is only used to help us improve how our website works, understand what interests our users and measure how effective our advertising is. 

We use performance cookies to... 

    1. Provide statistics on how our website is used 
    2. See how effective our adverts are (we don't use this information to target adverts to you when you visit other websites) 
    3. Provide feedback to partners that one of our visitors also visited their website. This can include details of any products bought. This lets our partners improve their website, but we don't allow our partners to reuse this information for further advertising 
    4. Help us improve the website by measuring any errors that occur 
    5. Test different designs of our website 

Cookies we have defined as “Performance” cookies will NOT be used to...

Accepting these cookies is a condition of using the Website, so if you prevent them we cannot guarantee how our site will perform for you.

    5. Share information with partners to provide a service on our website. The information shared is only to be used to provide the service, product or function and not for any other purpose 

Cookies defined as “Functionality” will not be used to target you with adverts on other websites. Some of these cookies are managed for us by third parties - where this is the case we don't allow the third party to use the cookies for any purpose other than those listed above. You can control whether or not these cookies are used, but preventing them may mean we can't offer you some services, and will reduce the support we can offer you. It's also possible that preventing these cookie stops us remembering that you didn't want a specific service. 

**Targeting**

“Targeting” cookies are linked to services provided by third parties, such as 'Like' buttons and 'Share' buttons. The third party provides these services in return for recognising that you have visited our Website. They are often used by advertisers for on line behavioural targeting. These cookies are used to work out what advertising might be most relevant to you based on the areas you look at on our sites, your IP address and geo-location. Advertising is then tailored to the user, but they do not know who you are. 

**3rd Party Cookies**

As part of delivering you the best content, we sometimes embed features, photos and video content from other websites, as a result, when you visit a page containing such content, you may be presented with cookies from these websites. The third party uses these cookies to provide services in return for recognising that you have visited our Website. We do not control the dissemination of these cookies and you should check that the relevant third party's website for more information.
