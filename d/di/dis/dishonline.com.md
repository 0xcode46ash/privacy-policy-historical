  * Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. 
  * When you order, we need to know your name, email address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and ship your order and to notify you of your order's status. 
  * We collect customerâ€™s contact information and financial information (such as their credit card numbers), which is used to send orders, information about our company, special offers and promotional material from us to our customers. 
  * The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch when necessary. 
  * Financial information that is collected is only used to bill the customer for requested products and services.
