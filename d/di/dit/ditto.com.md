Privacy Policy 

DITTO is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors to our website and customers of our services. We have established this Privacy Policy to explain what information we collect and how that information is used. By using our website or accessing our Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy and hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways. 

## Here is the information we collect:

### Login Information:

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us including, without limitation, your name, email address, gender, and password. If you login using a third party account (like Facebook), we will also collect your third party account login credentials as well as information you allow us to access including your basic information, your profile information, your birthday, interests, likes and locations and the user ID’s of your Facebook friends. 

### Purchase and Payment Information:

We store information related to your purchase including, without limitation, your phone number, address, zip code and shipping preference. Our payment gateway, Authorize.net, stores your credit card and payment information. 

### Your DITTO:

If you create a DITTO (a video of you from your webcam or mobile camera to virtually try on glasses), we receive and store your DITTO even if you don’t have an account. Your DITTOs are considered User Submissions should you choose to create them, and we reserve certain rights in your User Submissions as explained more fully in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). 

### Server Log Information and Cookies:

Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features. Our advertising partners may also transmit cookies to your browser or device, when you click on ads that appear on the Services. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. 

## Here is how we use the information we collect:

### Login Information:

We use your login information to allow you to set up a user account and profile and to personalize your experience. We use your email address to send you promotional emails about DITTO and our products and services. We may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us, which helps us make communications with you more interesting and relevant. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information, defined as any personally identifiable information, to anyone. That said, if you do not want to receive communications from us, please indicate your preference [here](https://web.archive.org/account/email-preferences). You can add, update or delete your personal information [here](https://web.archive.org/account/edit). You can delete your account [here](https://web.archive.org/account/edit). When you update or delete your information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records, but never in a manner that would identify you personally. 

### Purchase and Payment Information:

We save your address and phone number and our payment gateway Authorize.net saves your payment information including your credit card number in an effort to save you time during future purchases. 

### Your DITTO:

We save your DITTO so you can access it when you login again later. Even if you don’t create an account, we use your DITTO to improve our internal virtual fitting algorithms. 

If you opt-in to receive Crowd-Sourced Style Advice, which is described in our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use), your DITTO can be used in several ways: 

  * It can appear on our crowd-sourced style advice page, where other visitors can vote on which pair of glasses looks best on you. 
  * It can appear on a product page to show another use how a specific pair of glasses looks on other users. 
  * It can appear on our homepage to highlight our virtual try on technology. 
  * It can appear in advertising and marketing materials in connection with our business. 



If you’d like to opt out of crowd-sourced style advice, you can do so [here](https://web.archive.org/account/email-preferences). 

### Server Log Information and Cookies:

When we collect the usage information described in the Server Log Information and Cookies section above, we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. 

## We will Not Share Your Personally Identifiable Information

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. However, we may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section: 

### Information that’s no longer personally identifiable.

We may anonymize your Personal Information so that you are not individually identified, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners, who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate information to a partner in a manner that would identify you personally, as an individual. 

### Affiliates and Third Parties:

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

Under California Civil Code Sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of Personal Information, which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to [support@ditto.com](mailto:support@ditto.com). 

### Business Transfers:

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that would be transferred. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. 

### Protection of Ditto and Others:

We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Ditto, our employees, our users, or others. 

## Legal caveats our lawyers made us add:

**We make effort to keep your account secure but we cannot guarantee complete security.** Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via a third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. 

**We might make updates to this Privacy Policy.** If we do this, we’ll alert you to changes by placing a notice on [www.ditto.com](https://web.archive.org/), by emailing you, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you haven’t provided us with your email address, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. 

## Any Questions?

If you need clarification on any other terms we use in this Policy, please look at the definitions in the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use). 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to [support@ditto.com](mailto:support@ditto.com), and we will try to resolve your concerns.
