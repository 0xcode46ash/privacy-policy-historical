# Privacy Policy - Ditto

This Privacy Policy describes the policies of Ditto Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “our” or “us”) on the collection, use and disclosure of your (“you” or “your”) information in connection with your use of https://ditto.com (the “Site”).

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own or control, including any third party websites, services and applications that you elect to access through or in connection with the Site or Services, or to individuals that we do not manage or employ. We cannot take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those third parties and encourage you to carefully review their privacy policies before you access such services.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information you provide to us through the Site. If you choose to use our services or otherwise enter into an agreement with us, the collection, use, and disclosure of any information provided to us under the agreement between us will be governed by that agreement.

## Information Collected

Our privacy policy is not to collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information, except as described below.

  * You may choose to contact us through the Site to receive more information about our services or job openings. For service information, we ask for your full name, email address, company name and phone number and we collect and store such information if you choose to provide it. For job openings, we ask for your full name, resume, email address, past company name, phone number, social profile links, cover letter or other voluntary extra information, gender, age, and veteran status and we collect and store such information if you choose to provide it. Contacting us is voluntary, and we send emails only to those who first contact us.
  * In order to improve our services and learn about how users interact with our Site, we may automatically collect information such as your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (IP) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), and/or a date/time stamp for your visit. Some of this information may be collected using cookies and stored in log files. “Cookies” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire when you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them). Persistent cookies can be removed by following your browser’s directions. If you choose to disable cookies, some areas of our Site may not work properly.

## When and How We Disclose Information to Third Parties

We never share or sell your information to third parties for their own purposes. We may now or in the future contract with other companies to provide certain services to us, such as suppliers, insurers, payment processors and technology service providers, and we may need to give them access to information, such as your email address, in order for them to perform services for us. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any rights to use the information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

In addition, we may at times share aggregated and anonymized Site statistics with our partners and service providers so that we and they can understand how and how often people use our Site. We will never disclose Site statistics in a manner that would allow a third party to identify you individually without your express consent.

If we or our assets were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy. We do not currently have a parent company or any affiliates, but in the future we may and may share your information with them, but they will be subject to the same obligations set out in this policy.

We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information as we reasonably believe is necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (iii) protect our rights, property or safety, our users and the public.

## Security of Information

We store all of our information, including your personal information, using industry-standard techniques. Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet, unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. We do not guarantee or warrant that the techniques we employ will prevent unauthorized access to information about you that we store.

## Changes

If we make changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by sending you an email or by way of a conspicuous posting on the Site. Any material changes will take effect for existing users thirty (30) days after we give such notice and will be immediately effective for new users. If you do not agree to any such changes, please do not continue to use the Services following the effective date of such change.

## What Choices Do I Have?

You may request deletion of your personal information by sending an email to [support@ditto.com](mailto:support@ditto.com). Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.

## If You Have Questions or Concerns

Non-U.S. Users: Please be advised that your information may be processed in the country in which it was collected and in other countries, including the United States, where laws regarding processing of personal data may be less stringent than the laws in your country. If you have concerns about our processing of your personal data, please do not use the Services.

California Privacy Rights: Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties.
