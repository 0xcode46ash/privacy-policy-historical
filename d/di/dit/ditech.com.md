This Overall Privacy Statement verifies that **ditech.com** is a member of the Verisign program and is in compliance with Verisign privacy principles. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire Web site. 

Verisign is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by Verisign. When you visit a Web site displaying the Verisign logo, you can expect to be notified of: 

  * What information this site gathers/tracks about you

  * What this site does with the information it gathers/tracks

  * With whom this site shares the information it gathers/tracks

  * This site's opt-out policy

  * This site's policy on correcting and updating personally identifiable information

  * This site's policy on deleting or deactivating your name from our database




We believe that consumers have a keen interest in privacy. We also believe that by disclosing a Web site's data policy, organizations can proactively address this concern and gain consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is of critical importance, particularly as it relates to Internet commerce. With this in mind, **ditech.com** has become a member of Verisign and discloses its site privacy practices.

GMAC Mortgage d.b.a. **ditech.com** may capture implicit information from users who visit our Web site for aggregate statistical analysis and site customization. Implicit information is data that we can gather about the user without asking them. Importantly, aggregate statistical analysis means that **ditech.com** reviews trends based on information as a whole, but does not do so in an effort to identify the individual identity of the visitor to its site.

We also may solicit email for site feedback, business development, press inquiries, and human resources inquiries. In select instances, this information may be shared with reputable third companies. However, **ditech.com** does not willfully disclose human resource information solicited from our Web site to third parties.

IP addresses may be logged to track a user's session. An IP address is the unique numerical identity of your computer. When we "log" an IP address, it means that our Web site associates a visit or series of visits to that unique numerical identity. **ditech.com** also uses cookies in order to assist in aggregate statistical analysis and sometimes provide site customization based on anonymous session tracking. In other words, **ditech.com** uses cookies to determine trends for users as a whole, but not as means to learn about your individual identity. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the actual identity of users. On their own, they can be used to identify a computer, but not who is using that computer. Because of this, if **ditech.com** customizes the site based on cookies, we won't know who you are unless you tell us.

**ditech.com** collects the visitor's domain name (e.g. whether the user is logged on from yourserviceprovider.com), referral data (e.g. we record the last URL a user visited prior to clicking to **ditech.com** ), as well as browser and platform type (e.g., a Microsoft browser on a Macintosh platform). We also count, track, and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our sites (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within ditech.com). When and if ditech.com does present aggregated information to outside companies, no one would be able to identify you or contact you. 

**ditech.com** uses links throughout its web site to provide a visitor with the opportunity to contact us via email or Internet chat for a variety of purposes (including business development and human resource inquires). **ditech.com** may file information from emails or Internet chat sessions, review and discard the information, and share this information with third parties. Human resource information will not be shared with a third party without the express consent of the individual.

This site contains links to other sites. **ditech.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. This site supplements the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. By filling out the loan application, you are authorizing us to obtain your credit.

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. We have a secure, encrypted socket connection and we do not share our database with third parties for marketing purposes, with the exception of affiliates of **ditech.com**.
