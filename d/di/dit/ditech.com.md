**Overview**  
You take online privacy seriously, and so does ditech.com. It's our way of sustaining your trust in our company, our products and our services. Our privacy statement describes how we collect, protect and use customer information.

There are a few simple things that you can do to safeguard your information on the Internet: keep your account number, username and password safe, be sure to use a secure browser and keep your virus detection software current, never open email from an unknown source, and always log out of the loan status area when you're finished.

When you call, our security procedures require that we ask you for information only you would know-so we're sure it's you. However, no ditech.com employee will ever ask you for your account password.

This privacy statement applies to our online privacy policy. When you become a customer, and on an annual basis, we provide you with our privacy policy entitled "Important Information About Your Privacy." For complete information regarding our privacy policies and practices for customers, please refer to that notice.
