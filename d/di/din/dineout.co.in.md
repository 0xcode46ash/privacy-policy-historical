We will use your information for the purposes set out in the section titled ‘Our use of personal information’ below. You will have an opportunity to unsubscribe whenever we communicate with you. To unsubscribe from dineout communications please send an email to [admin@dineout.co.in](mailto:admin@dineout.co.in) with 'unsubscribe' in the subject box.

We may need to update this privacy statement from time to time. We recommend that you regularly check this page to ensure that you have read the most recent version.

**1\. Collecting personal information**  
You can decide what personal information you provide to us. We will only collect personal information that you choose to provide. Where possible, we will enable you to select how we will use this information (for example, by choosing to opt-in or opt-out of receiving special promotional offers).

You may choose to provide us with personal information if, for example, you: (a) contact us with an enquiry; (b) register on the Site; (c) fill out a survey or other form with your personal information included; (d) request that we provide you with information; (e) enter a competition; (f) post information such as restaurant reviews; or (e) participate in a promotion.

You have the opportunity to choose not to opt-in receive communications from us at any point where we request information about you.

By providing any personal information to us, you fully understand and clearly consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such information in, other countries or territories. Any such transfer and processing by us will be in accordance with this privacy policy.

**Third parties**  
(including but not limited to software providers, advertisers and ad placement agencies) may also use tracking technologies by or through the Site. We have no responsibility or liability for any tracking, data collection or other activities of such third parties.

**Social media**  
You can choose to access certain third party social media web sites and services through the dineout website. When you do so, you are sharing information with those sites, and the information you share will be governed by their privacy policies. You can modify your privacy settings with those third parties directly. We do not control the privacy policies of such third parties and assumes no responsibility or liability for the actions of such third parties.

**2\. Our use of personal information**  
We will use information collected from you in the following ways:

**Marketing purposes:**  
We may use information for internal marketing analysis, for example, to assess trends amongst our consumers or to measure the amount of traffic to our Sites. However, you will be able to opt out of these communications at any time. We may also share non-personal information with others, such as advertisers, in aggregate anonymous form, which means that the information will not contain any personally identifiable information about you.

**Information we provide to restaurants:**  
When you make a restaurant reservation using our website, your name and telephone number are provided to the restaurant to secure your booking. Your email address may also be provided to that restaurant, so that they can, if necessary, confirm any details including, but not limited to, applicable dietary requirements, special preferences, requests, set menus, or group bookings etc. Your details are not provided to that restaurant for marketing purposes unless you specifically indicate that you are interested in receiving promotional emails from that restaurant.

We will only share the information specified above with the restaurant at which you have made reservations using our website. Restaurants cannot access information pertaining to diners or dining histories from other restaurants, with the exception that restaurants under the same corporate ownership may elect to share diner information between restaurant properties.

**How restaurants handle your information:**  
dineout restaurants want to provide you with the best possible service so that you will visit them again. One way restaurants can distinguish themselves is by recognising returning diners and recalling their special preferences. If a restaurant chooses to note your preferences, that information may be typed into its System manually just as a restaurant might write a note on an index card. This data belongs to the restaurant, since it is a product of that restaurant's relationship with you. We do not access or use this information, and it is not shared with any other restaurant or third party. We create back-up copies of all information stored on the System for particular restaurant, to assist in the restoration process in the event of data loss.

The restaurants within dineout’s network are separate businesses. While dineout encourages them to comply with data protection requirements, we will not be responsible if these restaurants fail to comply with respect to your information. Any complaints or inquiries regarding use of your information by a restaurant, or marketing communications from a restaurant, should be addressed directly to the restaurant in question.

Restaurants may receive summary reports of feedback from recent diners. If you provide comments about a restaurant (via our website review) these will be shared with that restaurant anonymously. However there is the potential that a restaurant may associate a particular feedback with your dining reservation. You may choose not to be anonymous while submitting your comments if you specify your identity or provide contact information such as an email address for the restaurant to use in response to your feedback.

**Email from restaurants:**  
You may also consent to receive marketing communications from the restaurant at which you've made a reservation. We play no role in the content, frequency, timing or unsubscription process of any restaurant's marketing communications. If you would like to unsubscribe from a restaurant's marketing communications, please contact the appropriate restaurant directly.

**Transactional purposes:**  
We may use your personal information in order to respond to your queries and requests and to manage transactions such as credit card payments for any goods that you order from us or any of our agents, or for the fulfilment of such transactions (e.g. delivery). The personal information you provide may be used by an authorised vendor to fulfil that order. Notwithstanding the forgoing, we do not store your financial details.

**Third party offers:**  
We may arrange for carefully selected organisations to send you marketing and promotional information that may be of interest to you. In such circumstances your personal information may be disclosed to these organisations who will agree to be bound by the terms of this privacy statement. We will obtain your permission before we send you any such communications.

**Public (or interactive) areas of the Site:**  
Information that you post on or through the public areas of the Site (e.g. chat rooms, bulletin boards and discussion groups) are generally accessible to, and may be collected and used by, others and may result in unsolicited messages or other contact from others. Users of the Site are encouraged to exercise caution when providing personal information about themselves in public areas of this Site.

**Sale and transfer:**  
In the event of a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganisation or liquidation, we may transfer, sell, or assign to third parties information concerning your relationship with us, including without limitation, personally identifiable information that you provide and other information concerning your relationship with us.

**Administration and data management:**  
We may transfer your personal information to third parties under confidentiality obligations when the performance of any service in relation to the activities above is sub-contracted (e.g. the administration of a marketing campaign).

**Legal purpose:s**   
We may disclose your personal information if permitted by law or required to do so by law or where we believe such action is necessary in order to protect or defend our interests or the interests of our customers or users of our Site.

**Links:**   
This Site may contain links or references to other Web sites outside of our control. Please be aware that we have no control over these sites and our privacy statement does not apply to these sites.
