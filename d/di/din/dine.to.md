# Dine.TO Privacy Policy

**1.** Information Automatically Logged

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.

**2.** Cookies

Our Site uses cookies to keep track of your Hot List, and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly.

**3.** Advertisers

We may use an outside ad company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by the ad company, and we do not have access to this information.

**4.** Forms

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name, email, and postal address). Contact information from the registration forms is used to send information about our company, and to send promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the customer when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences.

Our site may, in some cases, use an contact form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect contact information (like their email address). Contact information from the forms is used to send promotional material in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner or sponsor to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings.

**5.** Reservation & Contact Forms

Many of our establishment profile pages contain a link labelled "Contact" and "Reservations" used to send comments and reservation booking requests to an establishment. Because the message is sent on Dine.TO's letterhead, we need to track potential abuse, therefore a copy of your e-mail is forwarded to Dine.TO's postmaster, these copies are deleted after the message has been checked and we do not collect e-mail addresses.

**6.** Surveys, Contests & VIP Forms with Partners and Sponsors

Our site may request information from users via surveys, contests and/or VIP Forms. Participation in these surveys, contests and/or VIP Forms is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and preferences (e.g. practices, opinions on industry issues, feedback on the Dine.TO web site).

We will use the contact information to notify winners and send periodical email announcements in conjunction with a non-affiliated partner or sponsor. If the survey, contest and/or VIP Form has a non-affiliated partner or sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the non-affiliated partner or sponsor in order to administer the co-branded products or services offered.

**7.** Opt-Out of Email Communications

If at any stage you wish no longer to receive any e-mails that you receive from Dine.TO and it's partners, you can opt-out by visiting <http://www.dine.to/newsletter_unsubscribe.php> or by unsubscribing via a link located in the actual email announcement or newsletter.

**8.** Our Disclosure of Your Information

Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

As a general proposition, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.

**9.** Discussion Forums

If you choose to post messages in our forums, your User Profile will also be given on the site allowing other users to click on it to find out more about you. Although you may update and choose your own User Profile, it is always publically available information. For all other personal profile information you may choose what other site users can see using the 'Profile' section of the site at <http://www.dine.to/phpBB2/profile.php?mode=editprofile>

**10.** "Send a friend" and "Text message a friend" services

Dine.TO offers a service whereby you can e-mail or text message site content (for example, a particular restaurant information) to a friend or colleague. This will involve entering the e-mail address or mobile number of your friend. We do not use the e-mail addresses or mobile numbers you enter for any purpose other than to send your e-mail or text message. We do not store, rent or sell these mobile numbers or e-mail addresses.
