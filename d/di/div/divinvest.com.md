**Purpose of the Internet Privacy Policy  **

At Diversified, protecting your privacy is very important to us. By posting our Internet Privacy Policy, we want you to understand what information we collect about you when you visit our Website and how we use that information. This Internet Privacy Policy also describes our practices for handling and securing such information. This Policy applies solely to information collected by this Website (divinvest.com). The Policy does not apply to third party websites, if any, linking to or from this site. Diversified is not responsible for the privacy practices employed by other sites. 

**Categories of Information We Collect  **

_Nonpublic Personal Information  _

Diversified will collect no personal information about you (such as your name or address) when you visit this Website unless you choose to provide that information to us. You may choose to provide us with personal information in order to use a password-protected portion of our Website (such as the Diversified Direct Online (DDOL) account access service and the RetireTekTM planning service), or to contact us by using e-mail. We use the information to service your account or, in the case of e-mail, to help us get you the information you have requested and to respond to your message. The password-protected portions of our Website are secure and you should consult the Security Information page on this Website for additional information about our Internet security procedures. E-mail on the Internet is not secure, however, unless you are using a secure e-mail program. 

_Other Information  _

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the Website, read pages, or download information, we will not gather and store any information about your visit.  

If you use our retirement or financial planning calculators, the information that you input into the calculator is used only for purposes of generating the illustration requested and is not stored by Diversified. Such calculators do not require you to input any information that identifies you personally. Diversified may conduct online surveys regarding its Website or other products or services. You may choose to complete such surveys by inputting the requested information. The information you provide is used collectively for analytical purposes, and individual responses are not tracked. 

_Cookies  _

"Cookies" are small text files that some websites transfer to your computer for added functionality, or for tracking website usage. A website may place personal information into the cookie file to help you navigate through the website. For example, a website may use the cookie file to store a password so that you do not have to continually input it every time you move to a different section of a password-protected portion of the website. Also, a website may place other information into the cookie file in order to measure the effectiveness of the site. For example, a website may use the cookie file to store the Internet domain or IP address from which you access the website, the type of browser and operating system used to access the site, the date and time you access the site, the pages you visit and the address of websites from which you access the site. Such information are compiled on an aggregate, anonymous basis. Most cookies are designed to expire after a certain period of time but you can delete your cookie file or set the browser to notify you when a website is sending a cookie to your computer so that you may accept or reject it. 

Diversified does not use cookies to gather and store information on its public Website. Consequently, Diversified does not track or record information about individuals' visits to the public Website. However, Diversified recognizes the benefits that such information can provide to help make our site more useful to visitors and to help us determine the effectiveness of the site. Accordingly, Diversified may develop a keen interest in making use of cookie technology in the future. With respect to the password-protected portion of the Website, the DDOL web application uses a cookie to hold the session ID of the user for the limited purpose of accessing Diversified's servers. This encrypted file is removed from the browser when the session is terminated.  

**Categories of Information We Disclose  **

Diversified does not disclose any information gathered or collected from this Website to any third party, except as may be required or permitted by law. 

**Our Information Security Procedures  **

In the event that you choose to submit nonpublic personal information on our Website, Diversified also takes steps internally to safeguard such information. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees and service providers who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. (If you become a retail customer of Diversified, you will receive a Privacy Notice when you open an account or otherwise submit an application form. The Privacy Notice describes Diversified's procedures for handling and safeguarding nonpublic personal information collected from you during the establishment and servicing of your account.) 

**Changes to the Privacy Policy  **

Diversified reserves the right to modify or supplement the Internet Privacy Policy at anytime. If we make changes, we will provide you with a revised policy that describes our new practices. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for changes. Your use of this Website after we have posted any changes to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of the changes.
