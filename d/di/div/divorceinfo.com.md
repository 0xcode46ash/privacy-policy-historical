**Welcome, friend.**

Divorce is just an absolutely awful process. Whether you're the [leaver](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/terminology.htm#Leaver) or the [left](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/terminology.htm#Left), whether you have [children](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/children.htm) or not, [divorce stinks](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/divorcestinks.htm). 

Divorceinfo.com is all about one simple principle: helping people who are going through divorce. I do this by giving you the information you need to stay [in control](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/takingcontrol.htm) of your divorce. I've intentionally placed links on each page to the key information most helpful to people using the site. If you're new to Divorceinfo.com, you may want to start by clicking on each link just to get an idea what's available here.

Web sites now make a big deal about their privacy policies and how carefully they guard information they gather from their readers. I don't have that problem. 

** Here's my privacy policy: I don't gather any information about you. Nothing.**

Everything you find here is available on a confidential basis. I never make any attempt to capture information about individual people who visit the site. You are welcome to come and go with total confidence that I haven’t the slightest idea who you are, when you were here, or what you read. The only time I would ever contact you in connection with Divorceinfo.com would be after you contact me first.

My only reason for doing this is to provide you quality information in a form you can use. The focus here is on you - the problems, issues, and yes, even the [opportunities](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/goodstuff.htm) you face in divorce. That means the focus is on what you need to know, not on anybody's legal, counseling, or mediation practice. It also means Divorceinfo.com is about information, not about spiffy graphics.

So what's here? There are more than 100,000 pages of information on Divorceinfo.com, so don't feel like you need to absorb it all. Just wander around. If you'd like, check out the [Site Map](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/sitemap.htm) for the most comprehensive summary of all that's available. One thing that's easy to miss is the wonderful feature called [Helping Each Other](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/HEOgateway.htm), where good people like you work to support each other through divorce.

My name is [Lee Borden](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/whosincharge.htm). If you want to, click on [Webmaster](https://web.archive.org/web/20081216010126id_/http%3A//divorceinfo.com/whosincharge.htm) on any page and find out more than you ever wanted to know about me, my family, my practice, and what makes me tick. And if you don't care, that's okay too. Because I'm not trying to convince you to hire me, I hope you'll find it easier to get the information you need. Simply. Quickly. Efficiently. That's why Divorceinfo.com is here.
