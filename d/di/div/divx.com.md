Just Between Us

Your privacy is very important to us here at DivX.com (which is owned and operated by DivXNetworks, Inc). We don't collect a lot of personally identifiable data about you, and what we do collect is used only for our internal purposes. We will not share any of your personal information with third parties unless we explicitly ask your permission to share it at the time you give us the information. All of your information is kept strictly confidential.

Please read the following summary of how we use your information. We may change this policy from time to time without advance notification, so please check back from time to time.

Our Web Site

We only collect information from you on our web site if you sign up for a DivX Forums account or if you sign up for the DivX News newsletter. Your DivX Forum account information is not used for any purpose except to allow you to use the Forums itself. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send you periodic mailings. When you sign up for the newsletter, you also have the option to opt-in for special offers from our partners. If you do, your email will also be used to send you those offers as they are made available. You may [opt-out](http://www.divx.com/list/unsubscribe.php) of receiving future newsletter mailings at any time.

Our web servers also record standard HTTP information like your IP address and your referrer. This information is not personally identified to you, and is only used to optimize our web site performance and plan our future web site features.

Occasionally, we sign agreements with third parties to promote their products on DivX.com. In some of these cases, we track referrals from DivX.com that subsequently result in product purchases. When one of these campaigns is active, you may be assigned a unique tracking number that allows us to count the number of referrals that result in purchases. This tracking number, while unique across all DivX.com visitors, cannot be personally identified with you and is not linked to your DivX Forum account in any way.

We don't presently use a third party ad server on DivX.com, but if and when we do, in the course of serving advertisements to this site, the ad server may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

Our Products

Our products (i.e., DivX™ codec, DivX Pro™ codec, DivX Player™ application) do not collect any personally identifiable information save for your email address, should you choose to sign up for the DivX News newsletter while registering a product.

When you purchase the DivX Pro software, we collect your personal information and your credit card information to complete the purchase. We store your personal information, but do not store your credit card. The personal information you give us during the purchase transaction is used only for our records.

The ad-supported version of the DivX Pro codec is bundled with GAIN software. The GAIN software may collect information about you in the course of its activities. Be sure to read the GAIN privacy policy for more details. You are free to uninstall the ad-supported version of the DivX Pro codec at any time, which will also uninstall GAIN.

Thanks for visiting. We at DivX.com value our own privacy, so we work hard to protect yours as well. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to write us at [privacy@divx.com](mailto:privacy@divx.com).

Sincerely,  
The DivX Team
