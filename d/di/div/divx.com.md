# Privacy Page

Any personally identifiable information you share with DivX.com is maintained and accessible only by DivX.com staff unless specifically stated otherwise. We request your information to give you customized experiences on this site.

DivX.com saves referral URL information, that is, how you got to DivX.com. We use this information to define our site advertising and service offerings. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our site.

DivX.com uses aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of DivX.com and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.

Our site's registration form asks for your contact information (name, email address), demographic information (zip code, age, gender), and preference information (your favorite movie genres). If you have signed up to receive the DivX.com newsletter, we will use your contact information to deliver it. You may opt-out of receiving future newsletters (see question 4). Contact information may also be used to contact you when necessary, for example, if you have won a contest, or have opted in to receive new software email updates. Demographic and preference data will be used to tailor your experience at the DivX.com site.

DivX.com may also collect aggregate search terms from its search service for the purpose of internal reporting, targeted advertising, product monitoring and product improvement.

DivX.com does not share your personal information with any third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise. DivX.com reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties such as advertisers, in which case your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed. Note that DivX.com may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users to the appropriate governmental authorities. In matters involving danger to personal or public safety, we may voluntarily provide information to appropriate governmental authorities.

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from DivX.com to the hard drive of your computer. We use cookies to save an identifier for your password, so you don't have to re-enter your password each time you visit our site. Cookies do not reveal any personally identifiable information.

An industry standard, cookies are used by most major websites. By default, most web browsers accept cookies, but you may reset your browser to notify you every time you receive a cookie. DivX.com does not require that you use cookies.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

All personal information that is collected by DivX.com is maintained and accessible only by DivXNetworks, Inc.

DivXNetworks, Inc. has relationships with many service and content companies. To expand our service and content offerings on DivX.com, we may occasionally offer co-sponsored/co-branded promotions. Some promotions require that you register with another company, and others require that we share your information with them. In the latter case, you will be notified at the point of collection if your information is to be shared. If you prefer that we not share your information with third parties, you may choose to not participate in the promotion.

DivX.com assumes no responsibility for the privacy practices of co-sponsor companies, so be sure to read their privacy statement and use your discretion when disclosing any personally identifiable information.

You may access and update your user profile by visiting the [Edit Profile page](http://www.divx.com/forums/prefs.php). You will be asked to login with your DivX.com username and password. If you have opted in to receive our email newsletter and decide you no longer want to receive it, please follow the instructions included with each newsletter.

While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to your information will not occur, we take many precautions and have implemented strict rules to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Only authorized employees under stringent control may access databases holding user data or the servers hosting our services. Particularly sensitive information, such as credit card numbers collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission.

You are ultimately responsible for the security of your DivX.com username and password. We recommend that you not divulge your password to anyone, and that you log out of your browser at the end of each computer so others cannot access your personal information and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place.
