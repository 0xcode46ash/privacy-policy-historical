# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us here at DivX.com. We don't collect a lot of personally identifiable data about you, and what we do collect is used only for our internal purposes. We will not share any of your personally identifiable information with third parties unless we explicitly ask your permission to share it at the time you give us the information and you grant us that permission or in the case of one of the exceptions noted below. All of your information is kept strictly confidential.

Please read the following summary of how we use your information. We may change this policy without advance notification, so please check back from time to time.

### DivX Account

Several services on DivX.com require you to sign up for a DivX Account. You can sign up for a DivX Account in four ways: 1) by signing up for a DivX .com account; 2) by signing up for the DivX News newsletter; 3) by signing up for a DivX Support Account within our Support section of DivX.com; or 4) by registering a DivX-Certified device (such as a DivX-Certified DVD player), which will require you to sign up for a DivX Video-On-Demand (VOD) Account. Your DivX Account information is used to enable you to access the services you sign up for on DivX.com. Your DivX VOD Account enables you to play your favorite DivX VOD movies on your DivX Certified devices. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send you periodic mailings as well as updates on new versions of your DivX software. When you sign up for the newsletter, you also have the option to opt-in for special offers from our partners. If you do, your email will also be used to send you those offers as they are made available. (We occasionally send out information on behalf of our partners, but we never provide your information to the partners--it always remains strictly with us.) You may opt-out of receiving future newsletter mailings at any time by changing your DivX Account settings. By signing up for any DivX Account, you agree that we may send you periodic emails requesting feedback on our services in the form of a survey.

You may optionally tell us more information about you and we will associate this information with your DivX Account. For example, you may tell us your gender, or what country you live in. In the future, this information may be used to show you more relevant information when you visit DivX.com (e.g., promotional material). If we share this information with third parties, we do so in an anonymous way such that your information cannot be uniquely identified with you. (For example, we may tell a third party "the person on DivX.com is from Germany" so they can display appropriate information. But we will not tell them "the person on DivX.com is Mr. Weber, who lives at X address.")

We reserve the right to disclose any personally identifiable information about you without your prior consent if we have a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable government request, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action; (2) detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (3) enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy or the DivX.com Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof; or (4) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of DivX, its users and/or the public.

As set out in the DivX.com Terms of Use, DivX.com does not intentionally target or direct its services at children under the age of thirteen (13), and does not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13). In addition, DivX.com does not permit any child under the age of thirteen (13) to participate in DivX.com communities, including DivX.com message boards. If DivX learns that a child under 13 is publicly posting or sharing personally identifiable information, such information will be deleted from the Site and that user will be blocked from accessing DivX.com. For more information about the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), please see the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA-related website.

### Our Web Site

Our web servers record standard HTTP information like your IP address and your referrer. This information is not personally identified to you, and is only used to optimize our web site performance and plan our future web site features.

Occasionally, we sign agreements with third parties to promote their products on DivX.com. In some of these cases, we track referrals from DivX.com that subsequently result in product purchases. When one of these campaigns is active, you may be assigned a unique tracking number that allows us to count the number of referrals that result in purchases. This tracking number, while unique across all DivX.com visitors, cannot be personally identified with you and is not linked to your DivX Account in any way.

We periodically enter into agreements with third party ad servers to show advertisements on DivX.com. These third party servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser that we have no technical control over. Be sure to read our advertisers' privacy policies for more details.

### Our Products

Our products (i.e., DivX速 codec, DivX Pro速 codec, DivX Converter速 application, DivX Player速 application, DivX for Mac ) generally do not collect any personally identifiable information during installation, save for your email address and country of residence should you choose to sign up for the DivX News newsletter while registering a product. In this case, country information is used to deliver messages that are regionally relevant to you (e.g., language of the email). Exceptions to this are noted in the sections below.

### Version checking

Once installed on your machine, each of our products will occasionally access the Internet to check for new versions. During this action, none of your personally identifiable information is sent to our servers.

### Installation

After any of our products are installed, the installer will ping our web server to record the number of people that have installed the software. This information is only used to track the aggregate number of installations, and no personally identifiable information is recorded on our server. 

### Rotating images

The DivX codec and DivX Player application incorporate rotating images into their interfaces. The products will update these images from time to time by accessing our web servers. When each image is displayed, an impression is recorded on our servers, so we can track how often each image is viewed. No personally identifiable information is stored on our servers during this transaction.

### Purchases

When you purchase the DivX Pro or DivX Converter software (for Mac or PC), we collect your personal information and your credit card information to complete the purchase. We store your personal information, but do not store your credit card. The personal information you give us during the purchase transaction is used only for our internal records and we will not share it with or sell it to third parties. If, at the time of purchase, you sign-up to receive email, we may use information such as your country to deliver messages that are regionally relevant to you.

### Google

The Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec is bundled with the Google Toolbar utility. If you opt-in to install the Google Toolbar, the Google Toolbar may collect information about you in the course of its activities. Be sure to read Google's privacy policy for more details. You are free to uninstall the Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec at any time, which will also uninstall the Google Toolbar.

### DivX Player first time startup

The first time you start the DivX Player application, you will be guided through a startup process. As a part of this process, you will be asked if you would like to send us information about your system configuration. You may optionally choose to send us this information. A button is provided during the process that allows you to review all of the information before it is sent. This information is used for diagnostic and product planning purchases only, and is stored in a separate database that is not in any way linked to personally identifiable information.

### Product activation

The DivX Create products must be unlocked or activated after they are purchased. (The free trial versions of the same do not need to be unlocked or activated.) As a part of this product activation process, you may be asked to enter your name, email and serial number. If the activation is successful, a personally identifiable activation code may be recorded on our servers. This information is necessary in order for the activation to successfully complete. We do not sell or otherwise disclose personally identifiable product activation information to third parties.

### Data integrity and security

DivX.com uses your personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and only in accordance with this Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. While we take reasonable steps to ensure that all personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

We are also committed to and do take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These measures include but are not limited to internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data.

We restrict access to personal information to DivX employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Site and services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

### That's all, folks

Thanks for visiting. We at DivX.com value our own privacy, so we work hard to protect yours as well. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to write us at privacy@divx.com .

Sincerely,  
The DivX Team
