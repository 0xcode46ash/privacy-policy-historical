# Privacy Policy

| 

Your privacy is very important to us here at DivX.com. We don't collect a lot of personally identifiable data about you, and what we do collect is used only for our internal purposes. We will not share any of your personal information with third parties unless we explicitly ask your permission to share it at the time you give us the information. All of your information is kept strictly confidential.

Please read the following summary of how we use your information. We may change this policy without advance notification, so please check back from time to time.

## DivX Account

Several services on DivX.com require you to sign up for a DivX Account. You can sign up for a DivX Account in two ways: 1) by signing up for a DivX Forums account, or 2) by signing up for the DivX News newsletter. Your DivX Account information is used to enable you to access the services you sign up for on DivX.com. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send you periodic mailings. When you sign up for the newsletter, you also have the option to opt-in for special offers from our partners. If you do, your email will also be used to send you those offers as they are made available. (We occasionally send out information on behalf of our partners, but we never provide your information to the partners-it always remains strictly with us.) You may opt-out of receiving future newsletter mailings at any time by changing your [DivX Account](http://www.divx.com/account/) settings.

You may optionally tell us more information about you and we will associate this information with your DivX Account. For example, you may tell us your sex, or what country you live in. In the future, this information may be used to show you more relevant information when you visit DivX.com (e.g., promotional material). If we share this information with third parties, we do so in an anonymous way such that your information cannot be uniquely identified with you. (For example, we may tell a third party "the person on DivX.com is a 21 year old male from Germany" so they can display appropriate information. But we will not tell them "the person on DivX.com is Mr. Weber, a 21 year old….")

## Our Web Site

Our web servers also record standard HTTP information like your IP address and your referrer. This information is not personally identified to you, and is only used to optimize our web site performance and plan our future web site features.

Occasionally, we sign agreements with third parties to promote their products on DivX.com. In some of these cases, we track referrals from DivX.com that subsequently result in product purchases. When one of these campaigns is active, you may be assigned a unique tracking number that allows us to count the number of referrals that result in purchases. This tracking number, while unique across all DivX.com visitors, cannot be personally identified with you and is not linked to your DivX Account in any way.

We periodically enter into agreements with third party ad servers to show advertisements on DivX.com. These third party servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

## Our Products

Our products (i.e., DivX® codec, DivX Pro™ codec, Dr. DivX™ application, DivX Player™ application) generally do not collect any personally identifiable information save for your email address, should you choose to sign up for the DivX News newsletter while registering a product. Exceptions to this are noted in the sections below.

#### Version checking

All of our products will occasionally access the Internet to check for new versions. During this action, none of your personal information is sent to our servers.

#### Installation

After any of our products are installed, the installer will ping our web server to record the number of people that have installed the software. This information is only used to track the aggregate number of installations, and no personally identifiable information is recorded.

#### Rotating images

The DivX codec and DivX Player application incorporate rotating images into their interfaces. The products will update these images from time to time by accessing our web servers. When each image is displayed, an impression is recorded on our servers, so we can track how often each image is viewed. No personally identifiable information is stored during this transaction.

#### Purchases

When you purchase the DivX Pro or Dr. DivX software, we collect your personal information and your credit card information to complete the purchase. We store your personal information, but do not store your credit card. The personal information you give us during the purchase transaction is used only for our records and we will not sell it to third parties.

#### Google

The Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec is bundled with the Google Toolbar utility. The Google Toolbar may collect information about you in the course of its activities. Be sure to read Google's privacy policy for more details. You are free to uninstall the Google-supported version of the DivX Pro codec at any time, which will also uninstall the Google Toolbar.

#### DivX Player first time startup

The first time you start the DivX Player application, you will be guided through a startup process. As a part of this process, you will be asked if you would like to send us information about your system configuration. You may optionally choose to send us this information. A button is provided during the process that allows you to review all of the information before it is sent. This information is used for diagnostic and product planning purchases only, and is stored in a separate database that is not in any way linked to personally identifiable information.

#### Product activation

The DivX Pro and Dr. DivX products must be activated after they are purchased. (The free trial versions of the same do not need to be activated.) As a part of this product activation process, you will be asked to enter your name, email and serial number. If the activation is successful, a personally identifiable activation code will be recorded on our servers. This information is necessary in order for the activation to successfully complete. We do not sell or otherwise disclose product activation information to third parties.

## That's all, folks

Thanks for visiting. We at DivX.com value our own privacy, so we work hard to protect yours as well. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to write us at [privacy@divx.com](mailto:privacy@divx.com "privacy@divx.com") .

Sincerely,  
The DivX Team
