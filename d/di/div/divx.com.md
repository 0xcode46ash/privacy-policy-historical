# Privacy Page

Your privacy is very important to us here at DivX.com (owned and operated by [DivXNetworks, Inc](http://www.divxnetworks.com/)). We don't collect a lot of personally identifiable data about you, and what we do collect is used only for our internal purposes. We will not share any of your personal information with third parties unless we explicitly ask your permission to share it at the time you give us the information. All of your information is kept strictly confidential.

Please read the following summary of how we use your information. We may change this policy from without advance notification, so please check back from time to time.

## DivX Account

Several services on DivX.com require you to sign up for a DivX Account. You can sign up for a DivX Account in three ways: 1) by signing up for a free trial of the Mastermind™ service, 2) by signing up for a DivX Forums account, or 3) by signing up for the DivX News newsletter. Your DivX Account information is used to enable you to use the services you sign up for on DivX.com. If you sign up for our newsletter, we will use your email address to send you periodic mailings. When you sign up for the newsletter, you also have the option to opt-in for special offers from our partners. If you do, your email will also be used to send you those offers as they are made available. You may opt-out of receiving future newsletter mailings at any time by changing your [DivX Account](http://www.divx.com/account) settings.

At your option, you may tell us more information about you and we will associate this information with your DivX Account. For example, you may tell us your sex, or what country you live in. In the future, this information may be used to show you more relevant information when you visit DivX.com (including advertisements). If we share this information with third parties, we will do so in an anonymous way such that your information cannot be uniquely identified with you. (For example, we may tell a third party "the person on DivX.com is a 21 year old male from Germany" so they can display appropriate information. But we will not tell them "the person on DivX.com is Mr. Weber, a 21 year old....")

## Our Web Site

Our web servers also record standard HTTP information like your IP address and your referrer. This information is not personally identified to you, and is only used to optimize our web site performance and plan our future web site features.

Occasionally, we sign agreements with third parties to promote their products on DivX.com. In some of these cases, we track referrals from DivX.com that subsequently result in product purchases. When one of these campaigns is active, you may be assigned a unique tracking number that allows us to count the number of referrals that result in purchases. This tracking number, while unique across all DivX.com visitors, cannot be personally identified with you and is not linked to your DivX Account in any way.

We periodically enter into agreements with third party ad servers to show advertisements on DivX.com. These third party servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.

## Our Products

Most of our products (i.e., DivX® codec, DivX Pro™ codec, DivX Player™ application) do not collect any personally identifiable information save for your email address, should you choose to sign up for the DivX News newsletter while registering a product. The Mastermind™ service collects more information, as discussed below.

### DivX Pro™

When you purchase the DivX Pro software, we collect your personal information and your credit card information to complete the purchase. We store your personal information, but do not store your credit card. The personal information you give us during the purchase transaction is used only for our records.

The ad-supported version of the DivX Pro codec is bundled with GAIN software. The GAIN software may collect information about you in the course of its activities. Be sure to read the GAIN privacy policy for more details. You are free to uninstall the ad-supported version of the DivX Pro codec at any time, which will also uninstall GAIN.

### Mastermind™

The Mastermind™ media management service collects information about your media collection and stores it in a central location, thus giving you the ability to manage and play your media from anywhere, to anywhere. The service stores ID3 information (if available) for the audio files in your collection, and it stores filename and file size information for the video files in your collection.

This information is only used to allow you access to your own media collection. We do not use this information in any other way, nor do we share this information with any external parties.

Thanks for visiting. We at DivX.com value our own privacy, so we work hard to protect yours as well. If you ever have any questions, please feel free to write us at [privacy@divx.com](mailto:privacy@divx.com).

Sincerely,  
The DivX Team
