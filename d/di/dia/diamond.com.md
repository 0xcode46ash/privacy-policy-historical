Specifically, Diamond.com gives your name, shipping address, phone number, and order information to our shipping carrier. Diamond.com also supplies your name, billing address, and credit card information to the credit card processor who bills your account. Diamond.com has strict guidelines requiring all third parties to keep any shared personal information confidential.

**_Surveys_**  
From time to time, Diamond.com or a company selected by Diamond.com may offer you the opportunity to participate in customer satisfaction, site improvement and other business-related surveys. You may be asked to provide certain membership information to participate. All surveys are optional. 

**_Contests_**

You will be asked to provide certain membership information to participate in a sweepstakes. Diamond.com or a company selected by Diamond.com administers the sweepstakes and contacts the winner. All sweepstakes are optional. 

**How We Use the Information**  
The ways in which we use the information you provide are as follows: 

**_Cookies_**  
Put simply, a cookie is a small piece of information that web sites use to remember information about users. Diamond.com uses two types of cookies to recognize our members and remember shopping list items. Diamond.com uses transient cookies to provide continuity from page to page. Within a single visit, these cookies store information such as your shopping list to simplify checkout. They do not contain any personally identifying information. 

Diamond.com uses persistent cookies to identify members after their first visit. These cookies remain on the hard drive of a PC and allow a member to enter the site without having to log in on every visit. To access any secure areas such as your account information, you must still enter your password. You can choose to disable persistent cookies by deselecting that option under your browser preferences. When you disable persistent cookies, you can browse Diamond.com, but you cannot access your membership information or make purchases. Disabling cookies can also interrupt audio and cause breaks in navigation. When becoming a Diamond.com member, you can choose whether or not to accept the Diamond.com persistent cookie. Without the persistent cookie, a user can still shop at Diamond.com. 

**_Usage Tracking_**  
Diamond.com’s database tracks the traffic throughout our site. This information is used to compile overall statistics and is not recorded at an individual level. The statistics help us decide which products and services best serve our members and guests. 

**_Aggregate Information_**  
Diamond.com uses aggregate information from demographic surveys and traffic patterns to customize our site. State-of-the-art comparison technology allows us to use this information to make recommendations to members based on previous traffic patterns and purchases. Diamond.com uses information only on an aggregate level and does not track information about individuals. Aggregate information may be shared with partners of Diamond.com to plan advertising or promotions. We do not share any individual information. 

**_Electronic Mailings_**  
At any time, a member of Diamond.com may choose not to receive further electronic direct mail.

Member Account Information Members always have access to their accounts through the Diamond.com website. The 'Account Info' link on our home page allows members to access their individual accounts to review their order status and history. We keep this area of our site secure and provide access only with the use of a member-specific password. If we make changes to our privacy policy, we will make every effort to post updates on our website. 

**_Permission To Use Your Content_**  
By transmitting any suggestions, information, identification, material, or other content (collectively, 'content') to Diamond.com, you automatically grant Diamond.com the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, redistribute, transmit, perform and display such content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed for the full term of any rights that may exist in such content. Further, Diamond.com is free to use any ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, and suggestions contained in any communications you send to this Site for any purpose whatsoever, including but not limited to creating, manufacturing, and marketing products and/or services using such information.
