## What personal information is held by DRI and how is this information being used? 

### Registration

If you are a DRI owner, member, own a timeshare interest at a DRI-managed resort, or reserve accommodations at our resorts as a non-owner or non-member, you provide your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as part of our registration process to create a unique login name and password. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to complete reservations, save points, make payments; (iii) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; and (iv) to customize the content of our site to meet your specific needs. In addition, your e-mail address is collected to send you an e-mail message confirming your new registration and each savings request, payment or reservation you transact online. As an owner, member or guest you will occasionally receive updates from us about discounted availability, special offers, new services and products which may be of interest to you and other noteworthy news items.

This information may be provided by letter, e-mail, telephone or any other reasonable means of communication. If you do not wish to receive such information, please notify us: 

  * In Europe by writing to our Customer Services Department at Citrus House, Caton Road, Lancaster, LA1 3UA, by telephoning our Customer Services Department at 0845 3590010, or by e-mailing our Customer Services Department at euhsirm@diamondresorts.com

### Browser Data, Cookies and other Web Technologies

Like many websites, this website uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, to improve your user experience. Cookies are elements of data sent to your browser which can then be stored on your computer. Although you may disable cookies in your browser and still access and use this website, disabling cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain features on the website.

This website uses Google Analytics (“GA”) and Inspectlet to collect data activity. GA may be used for Display Advertising. By using Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of GA for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at the following link: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/. This website also uses Remarketing with GA to advertise online. Third-Party vendors, including Google, may show ads on sites across the internet. This website and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the GA cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our website; report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to this website. Inspectlet tracks IP addresses, session lengths, and starting pages. Visitors can visit http://www.inspectlet.com/optout for opt-out options.

Some web browsers may let you enable a "Do Not Track" feature that sends signals to the website you visit, indicating you do not want your online activities to be tracked or engage in other types of data collection. These are segments of computer code that communicate with a website similarly to cookies. However, this is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies. This website does not currently honor "Do Not Track" requests. If we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Policy. 

### Owner/Member and Non-Owner/Non-Member Profiles

Owners, Members, Non-Members and Non-Owners can choose to provide DRI with credit-card information. This information is primarily used to assist in making payments quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly.

### Sweepstakes and Contests

DRI frequently sponsors sweepstakes and contests to give owners/members and non-owners/non-members the opportunity to win great travel prizes. Information collected by DRI for such contests can include contact information and survey questions. Contact information is used to notify contest winners, and survey information is used to develop promotions and product improvements to DRI.

### Online Surveys

DRI values opinions and comments from owners, members and guests so we frequently conduct online surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all owners, members and guests. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to DRI products and services and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for owners. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

### IP Addresses

DRI collects IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration. 

### Server Logs

Like many other websites, our servers automatically record information about your IP address, which ads you click on, the page that directed you to our website, and the browser type used while accessing our website. A server log stores the information collected so it can be analyzed. 

### Who will the information be shared with, if anyone? 

Our affiliates include companies that are subsidiaries and affiliates of Diamond Resorts Corporation and Diamond Resorts (Europe) Limited. Your information may be shared with any of our affiliates. Other than to Interval International Inc. and its subsidiaries, data will not be made available to companies outside our group for marketing purposes although it may be necessary, from time to time, to release information about you (including sensitive information such as a medical condition, disability or a dietary requirement) to external suppliers such as airlines/car hire companies to enable a comprehensive service be provided to you and to process the transaction information. Please also be advised that all airlines are now required by laws introduced in the US and other countries to give cross border control agencies access to customer data. Accordingly any information held about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to the customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary. The data of European Members of THE Club may also be supplied to First National Trustee Company Limited, an Isle of Man based company (whose details are set out in the Deed of Trust) in order to enable it to perform its supervisory and regulatory functions. 

We do not sell individual customer names or other private profile information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future. Occasionally, DRI will hire a third party to act on our behalf for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement ensuring that it is used solely for completing the specific project. See "What other information should I know about my privacy?" below.

We may collect information from you that is not Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) such as the date and time you visited the website, the web browser you used, and the page you visited that directed you to our website. This non-PII is collected and analyzed to determine how you found out about us, your interests in our products and services, and how to improve our website. We may also collect information from your activities on the website and other websites for the purpose of generating advertisements according to your interests and preferences. This may result in our ads being displayed on participating websites based on your browsing activity. This is achieved by allowing third party advertising companies to access things like cookies, IP addresses, and server logs.

Some of the non-PII collected may be combined with your PII to further enhance your experience while on the website. Although we do not share your information with anyone other than those described above, external third parties may use their own tracking software which collects information about you through the website. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT INFORMATION SUCH THIRD PARTIES ACCESS, AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

### How to access your information (including how to update or correct inaccuracies)

Please contact us at THEClub@diamondresorts.com or please notify us by writing to our Customer Service department at 10600 West Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135

### What safeguards are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of your information?

The data provided by you will be treated as confidential and security measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized processing. All information you provide to DRI is transmitted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that lets your browser automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you send it to us. While we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of all material submitted that is marked as confidential by the submitter, we cannot accept, and hereby expressly disclaim any liability from losses relating to the unauthorized disclosure or interception via the Internet of any information that you submit. 

### What other information should I know about my privacy? 

In addition to the circumstances described above, DRI may disclose owner, member, non-member and non-owner information if required to do so by law, court order, as requested by other government or law enforcement authority. DRI may also disclose owner, member, non-member and non-owner information, if, in good faith, we believe that disclosure is necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of DRI or in order to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities. Any material changes in the way DRI uses personal information will be described in future versions of this Privacy Policy. Of course, you may always submit concerns regarding our Privacy Policy or our privacy practices to THEClub@diamondresorts.com. Please reference the Privacy Policy in your subject line. DRI will attempt to respond to all reasonable concerns or inquiries within five business days of receipt. By visiting this website, you acknowledge and accept this privacy policy. We may, from time to time, revise this privacy policy by posting the revised privacy policy on our site. By continuing to use this website after such changes, you signify your acceptance of the changes.

### Children

Under age 13: If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

Ages 13-21: You must be at least 21 years old in order to submit any information, participate in any online sweepstakes or contests, or reserve a stay.
