# Privacy Policy | Diamond Resorts International®

## 1\. Introduction

This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Diamond Resorts International, Inc. and its subsidiaries ("Diamond") collects, uses, maintains, and discloses information collected from you though the use of this website ("Site"). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Diamond.

Because protecting your privacy is important to us, Diamond has implemented this Privacy Policy so that you fully understand:

\- What information is held by Diamond.  
\- How the information will be used.  
\- With whom the information will be shared (if anyone).  
\- How to opt out of e-mail updates.  
\- How to access your personally identifiable information (“PII”) (including how to update or correct inaccuracies).  
\- What safeguards are in place to protect your information.  
\- Other information about your privacy.

## 2.1. Registration Information

If you are a Diamond owner or member, own a timeshare interest at a Diamond-managed resort, or reserve accommodations at our resorts as a non-owner or non-member, you will provide your name, address, telephone number and e-mail address as part of our registration process to create a unique login name and password. This information is collected on the registration form for several reasons including: (i) personal identification; (ii) to complete reservations, save points and make payments; (iii) to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; and (iv) to customize the content of our Site to meet your specific needs. In addition, your e-mail address is collected to send you an e-mail message confirming your new registration and each savings request, payment or reservation you transact online.  As an owner, member or guest you may occasionally receive updates from us about discounted availability, special offers, new services and products which may be of interest to you and other noteworthy news items.

This information may be provided by letter, e-mail, telephone or any other reasonable means of communication. If you do not want to receive these updates, in addition to other unsubscribe options, you may also notify us at:

In Europe by writing to our Customer Services Department at Citrus House, Caton Road, Lancaster, LA1 3UA, by telephoning our Customer Services Department at 0345 3590010, or by e-mailing our Customer Services Department at [assistanceeurope@diamondresorts.com](mailto:assistanceeurope@diamondresorts.com)

Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135, by telephoning 877.374.2582, or by e-mailing our Customer Services Department at [THEClub@diamondresorts.com](mailto:THEClub@diamondresorts.com).

## 2.2. Sweepstakes and Contests

Diamond may sponsor sweepstakes and contests to give owners/members and non-owners/non-members the opportunity to win great travel prizes. Information collected by Diamond for such contests may include contact information and survey questions.

## 2.3. Online Surveys

Diamond values opinions and comments from owners, members and guests so we frequently conduct online surveys. These surveys are entirely optional for all owners, members and guests. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to Diamond products and services and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for owners. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

## 2.4. IP Addresses

Diamond collects IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and for system administration.

## 2.5. On-Property Collection

Local laws may require that we collect additional information from you during registration / check-in at our properties. We may also use closed circuit television and other security measures at our properties that may capture or record images of guests, visitors in public areas and information related to your location while on our properties via keycards and other technologies. We may also use other technologies that record sound or video to protect our staff. In addition, we may collect individual information in connection with on-property services, such as concierge services and activities.

## 2.6. Server Logs

Like many other websites, our servers automatically record information about your IP address, which ads you click on, the page that directed you to our Site, and the browser type used while accessing our Site. A server log stores the information collected so it can be analyzed.

## 2.7. Cross-border data transfers

Diamond takes compliance with its privacy and data protection obligations seriously and intends that its corporate Privacy Policy will materially comply with applicable privacy laws and regulations in the different jurisdictions in which we do business.  In the event of cross-border transfer from the EU/UK or Switzerland to the United States, Diamond will follow mechanisms approved by the United States, the European Union, Switzerland and the United Kingdom for such transfers.  These mechanisms may include (i) the EU–U.S. Privacy Shield (or other similar framework), (ii) the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield (or other similar framework), or (iii) standard Model Contract Clauses approved by the European Commission (or other similar framework).  Diamond adheres to the  Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement and Liability.

## 2.8. Individual Information

We may collect information from you that is not PII such as the date and time you visited the Site, the web browser you used, and the page you visited that directed you to our Site. This individual information is collected and analyzed to determine how you found out about us, your interests in our products and services, and how to improve our Site. We may also collect information from your activities on the Site and other websites for the purpose of generating advertisements according to your interests and preferences. This may result in our ads being displayed on participating websites based on your browsing activity. This is achieved by allowing third party advertising companies to access things like cookies, IP addresses, and server logs.

Some of the individual information collected may be combined with your PII to further enhance your experience while on the Site.

## 2.9. Credit Card Information

Owners, Members, Non-Members and Non-Owners can choose to provide Diamond with credit-card information. This information is primarily used to assist in making payments quickly without having to type in the same information repeatedly.

## 2.10. Requesting PII

You always have the right to review the PII we keep about you. You can request an overview of your PII by contacting us. Please write "Request PII" in the subject line of your email and include a copy of your identity card to help us prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing your PII.

## 2.11. Updating PII

If the PII we have for you is incorrect, we'll update it at your request. If you do not want to use Diamond services anymore, you can ask us to block your PII from being used again. You can delete your user account at any time by signing in on the Diamond website, going to the “Settings” page, and choosing to remove your account. You can unsubscribe from the Diamond newsletter at any time by using the “Unsubscribe” link included with each newsletter. Requests to update, block, or remove PII can be made by contacting us at the [THEclub@diamondresorts.com](mailto:THEclub@diamondresorts.com).

By continuing to use this Site after such changes, you signify your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.

## 3.3. Retention of your PII

Diamond will retain your PII for a period that is reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

## 3.4. Devices

We have free apps for a variety of mobile devices and use versions of our regular Site that have been optimized for mobile. These apps and mobile websites process the personal details you give us in much the same way as our Site does – and they also allow you to use location services to find accommodations nearby. With your consent, we may send you push notifications with information about your reservation.

## 4.1. Affiliates

Our affiliates include companies that are subsidiaries and affiliates of Diamond Resorts Corporation and Diamond Resorts (Europe) Limited. Your information may be shared with any of our affiliates.

## 4.2. Other Companies

Other than to Diamond and its subsidiaries, your information will not be made available to companies outside our group for marketing purposes although it may be necessary, from time to time, to release information about you (including sensitive information such as a medical condition, disability or a dietary requirement) to external suppliers such as airlines/car hire companies to enable a comprehensive service be provided to you and to process the transaction information.

## 4.3. Customs and Immigration Authorities

Please also be advised that all airlines are now required by laws introduced in the U.S. and other countries to give cross border control agencies access to customer data. Accordingly any information held about you and your travel arrangements may be disclosed to the customs and immigration authorities of any country in your itinerary.

## 4.4. First National Trustee Company Limited

Information for Diamond European Members may also be supplied to First National Trustee Company Limited, an Isle of Man based company (whose details are set out in the Deed of Trust) in order to enable it to perform its supervisory and regulatory functions.

## 4.5. Other Third Parties

We do not sell individual customer names or other private profile information to third parties and have no intention of doing so in the future. Occasionally, Diamond will hire a third party to act on our behalf to assist Diamond in furtherance of its business, such as processing reservations for our owners, members and guests, and for projects such as market-research surveys and contest-entry processing and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection therewith. The information we provide to such third parties is protected by a confidentiality agreement ensuring that it is used solely for the purposes for which it was provided.

## 4.6 Authorities Permitted By Law

We may disclose your information to law enforcement and other governmental authorities insofar as it is required by law or is strictly necessary for the prevention, detection or prosecution of criminal acts and fraud. Diamond may also disclose owner, member, non-member and non-owner information, if, in good faith, we believe that disclosure is necessary or advisable including, without limitation, to protect the rights or properties of Diamond or in order to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing interference with our rights or properties, whether intentionally or otherwise, or when anyone else could be harmed by such activities.

## 4.7 Third Party Tracking Software

Although we do not share your information with anyone other than those described above, external third parties may use their own tracking software which collects information about you through the website. WE HAVE NO CONTROL OVER WHAT INFORMATION SUCH THIRD PARTIES ACCESS, AND HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR ANY TRACKING, DATA COLLECTION, OR OTHER ACTIVITIES OF SUCH THIRD PARTIES.

## 4.8 Corporate Transactions

We may disclose your information to a third party who acquires any part of Diamond itself or any of its affiliates, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of Diamond’s assets.

Please contact us at [THEClub@diamondresorts.com](mailto:THEClub@diamondresorts.com) or please notify us by writing to our Customer Service department at 10600 West Charleston Blvd, Las Vegas, Nevada 89135.

## 6.1. Cookies

Like many websites, this Site uses automatic data collection tools, such as cookies, to improve your user experience. Cookies are elements of data sent to your browser which can then be stored on your computer. We use cookies to:

\- Help remember and process the items in the shopping cart.  
\- Understand and save your preferences for future visits.  
\- Keep track of advertisements.  
\- Compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may also use trusted third-party services that track this information on our behalf.

Although you may disable cookies in your browser and still access and use this Site, disabling cookies may prevent you from taking advantage of certain features on the Site.

## 6.2. Google Analytics and Inspectlet

This Site uses Google Analytics (“GA”) and Inspectlet to collect data activity. GA may be used for Display Advertising. By using Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of GA for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads at the following link:

<http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/>

This Site also uses Remarketing with GA to advertise online. Third-Party vendors, including Google, may show ads on websites across the internet. This Site and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the GA cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to our Site; report how ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to this Site. Inspectlet tracks IP addresses, session lengths, and starting pages. Visitors can visit <http://www.inspectlet.com/optout> for opt-out options.

## 6.3. Foglight Transaction Recorder

Diamond uses Foglight Transaction Recorder technology and may record mouse clicks, mouse movements, page scrolling and any text keyed into website forms. Data collected by this recording system will be used to improve our Site usability and customer service. Foglight does not track your browsing habits across websites which do not use the Foglight service.

## 6.4. Do Not Track Requests

Some web browsers may let you enable a "Do Not Track" feature that sends signals to the website you visit, indicating you do not want your online activities to be tracked or engage in other types of data collection. These are segments of computer code that communicate with a website similarly to cookies. However, this is different than blocking or deleting cookies, as browsers with a “do not track” feature enabled may still accept cookies. This Site does not currently honor "Do Not Track" requests. If we do so in the future, we will describe how in this Privacy Policy.

## 7.1. Security Measures

Diamond will take reasonable measures to: (i) protect your PII from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, and (ii) keep PII accurate and up-to-date as appropriate. We also seek to require our affiliates and service providers with whom we share PII to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of PII about you. For online transactions, we use reasonable technology to protect PII that you transmit to us via our Site. Unfortunately, however, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure.

## 7.2. Disclaimer

While we endeavor to maintain the confidentiality of all material submitted that is marked as confidential by the submitter, we cannot accept, and hereby expressly disclaim any liability from losses relating to the unauthorized disclosure or interception via the Internet of any information that you submit. Furthermore, our Site may contain links to third parties' websites. Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, use, maintenance, sharing, or disclosure of data and information by such third parties.

For your own privacy protection, we encourage you not to include PII or other sensitive personal information in any emails you send to us. Please do not send PII, credit card numbers, or any sensitive personal information to us via email.

## 8.1. Under age 13

If you are under 13 years of age, please do not send any information about yourself, including your name, address or e-mail address. If we discover that we have collected any personally identifying information from a child under the age of 13, we will remove that information from our database as soon as possible.

## 8.2. 13-18:

You must be at least 18 years old in order to submit any information, participate in any online sweepstakes or contests, or reserve a stay.

Diamond has the discretion to update or revise this Privacy Policy at any time. When we do, the revised, updated date will be displayed at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this Privacy Policy periodically and become aware of modifications.

By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
