# Diabetes Health - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is a top priority at _Diabetes Health_. We've taken precautions to secure your information and our physical premises. Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [the Webmaster](https://web.archive.org/contact.html?address=Webmaster).

_Diabetes Health_ uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information.

##### Site Feedback

Under "[Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact.html)," we maintain e-mail links to various _Diabetes Health_ members to collect feedback on products and services. We collect visitors' contact information (like e-mail address). Customer contact information is used only to respond to inquiries.

##### Editorial Polls

Under "[Editorial Polls](https://web.archive.org/polls/editorial.html)," we collect personal information for citation purposes in the print magazine and/or website. If you do not wish your information to be published, please check the appropriate box to have your information withheld.

##### E-mail List

If you choose to receive our weekly newsletter, we ask for an e-mail address you would like _Diabetes Health_ sent to. We do not sell your e-mail address. On occasion, no more than four times per month, we may send, on behalf of third parties, relevant offers of interest. We will never sell your e-mail address to these parties. Customer contact information is used to contact visitors when necessary. To opt out of receiving future mailings, visit our [Newsletter Preference Center](https://web.archive.org/newsletter.html).

##### Online Surveys

Occasionally we send out an online survey via e-mail to random newsletter subscribers. Our surveys ask visitors for contact information (e-mail address) and general demographic data (such as gender, geographic location or occupation). We use survey results on an aggregate basis to improve _Diabetes Health_. No personal information is shared with third parties. We do not sell your e-mail address to marketers.

##### Ad Serving

We use a third-party software to serve ads. _Diabetes Health_ may use information (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about visits to our site, in combination with non-personally identifiable information about your purchases and interests from other sources, in order to provide ads about goods and services of interest to you.

In addition, we share site usage information with other companies for the sole purpose of managing and targeting ads and for market research. _Diabetes Health_ and third-party ad servers may occasionally track pages you visit through with pixel tags (or "clear gifs"). In the course of serving ads, an advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer.
