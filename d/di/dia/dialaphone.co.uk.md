# Privacy policy - Dial-a-Phone

Dial-a-Phone Limited is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This privacy policy explains how we use the information we collect about you, how you can instruct us if you prefer to limit the use of that information and procedures that we have in place to safeguard your privacy.

* ### The Information We Collect and How We Use It ...Top

When you wish to obtain products and services from us we need to know your name, your address (and for contract mobile phones 3 years of address history), e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number and expiry date and your bank sort code and account number. We also need to know your date of birth and your residential, employment and marital status.

We gather this information to allow us to process any orders you may make which may include undertaking credit checks (both by us and third parties) and in connection with you obtaining an airtime agreement and mobile phone insurance. The relevant information is then used by us, our agents and sub-contractors, airtime providers and insurance companies to provide you with the products and services you have ordered and to communicate with you on any matter relating to the provision of the services and products in general. To help us and airtime providers to make credit decisions about you, to prevent fraud and to check your identity we and third parties may search their respective files and the files of credit reference agencies who will record any credit searches on your file. Details of how you conduct your account may be disclosed to such agencies. The information will be used by other credit grantors for making credit decisions about you and the people with whom you are financially associated, for fraud prevention, money laundering prevention and occasionally for tracing debtors.

We may also use aggregate information and statistics for the purposes of monitoring website usage in order to help us develop the website and our services and may provide such aggregate information to third parties. These statistics will not include information that can be used to identify any individual.

From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone, SMS and other messaging services or fax to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services and products.

We and our group companies may also wish to provide you with information about other services or products we think may be of interest to you. You may be contacted by any of the above methods for this purpose. If you would rather not receive this information, or if you would rather only receive this information by particular methods (such as email) please send an e-mail to [privacy@dialaphone.com](mailto:privacy@dialaphone.com) or write to:

* ### Our Use of Cookies and Other Information Gathering Technologies ...Top

We monitor the use of our website for customer traffic and purchasing patterns by the use of "session cookies".

Cookies are text files that identify your computer to our server. Our server will automatically issue you with a cookie when you enter our site. Many sites use cookies to track traffic flows through their sites.

Our cookies only record those areas of the site that have been visited by your computer, and for how long. You do have the opportunity to set your browser to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these, of course, means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user.

Our website is being monitored by Speed Trap Limited's monitoring software and may capture information regarding your visit that will help us improve the quality of our service and the design of our Site.

* ### How We Protect your Information ...Top

The Internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures as set out in this policy.

We realise how important it is to securely store any information that you provide. Dial-a-Phone on all of its websites maintains the highest levels of security. Our sites use high-level SSL encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You can therefore rest assured that we take the privacy and security of your payment and personal details very seriously.

You can tell whether a page is secure as a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. Only the Checkout stage will be secure to protect your data.

We also keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of Dial-a-Phone Limited cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.

We must advise that despite the measures that we take to ensure that the security facilities that we provide are of the highest standards as possible, it is necessary for us to notify you that there is no guarantee that any e-mail sent by you to us at this site will be received by Dial-a-Phone, or that the message will remain confidential whilst in transit. You therefore accept that by acknowledging this situation that you do so at your own risk.

* ### Sale of Business ...Top

If our business is sold or integrated with another business your details may be disclosed to our advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers and will be passed on to the new owners of the business.

* ### Updating your Details ...Top

If any of the information that you have provided us changes, for example if you change your e-mail address or name, please let us know the correct details by sending an e-mail to [privacy@dialaphone.com](mailto:privacy@dialaphone.com) or by sending a letter to:

Privacy Manager at Dial-a-Phone Ltd,  
53-79 Highgate Road,  
London, NW5 1TL 
* ### Your Consent ...Top

By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it.

Owing to the global nature of the Internet infrastructure, the information you provide may be transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area that do not have similar protections in place regarding your data and its use as set out in this policy. However, we have taken the steps outlined above to try to improve the security of your information. By submitting your information you consent to these transfers.

* ### How to Contact Dial-a-Phone ...Top

We welcome your views about our website and our privacy policy. If you would like to contact us with any queries or comments please send an e-mail to [privacy@dialaphone.com](mailto:privacy@dialaphone.com).

* ### Authorising Third Parties to access your Information ...Top

When you contact us we will require you to answer certain security checks prior to discussing your account with you. Our policy is that if you wish to authorise a third party to discuss your account with us, you must give us specific authority in advance. Should you need a third party to act on your behalf with Dial-a-Phone, then you must advise our Customer Care Authorisation team that you will need to arrange this facility.

To enable this to take effect, you must contact Customer Care on: 0870 3336061 who will confirm your request, having completed their security checks. However they may also ask that you put your request in writing.
