# Privacy Policy | American Diabetes Association

## The Journals of the American Diabetes Association

### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used by the American Diabetes Association (ADA).

#### 1\. Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you request information, order a product or service, register using one of our forms, donate, or contact us offline, we may need your specific information in order to process your registration/request and reply promptly.

We may ask you for contact information (such as your name, email and address) and demographic information (such as your zip code or age). We also collect demographic and profile data at our site and in our databases. We ask for health-related data to help us help you through our information, our programs, and our services. We use data you provide to tailor your experience at ADA and develop and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

In general, we use identifiable information to provide services and complete transactions, as indicated below. Part of our mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, and we do that by providing appropriate health information. We do not provide your name and address or email to outside parties, except as described here. To learn more about our encryption policies, please review the section on "Protecting Personal Information" (below).

ADA's policy regarding disclosure of personal information can be found in the section on "Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and Cookies" (below).

We use your personal information only for providing and improving our websites and mobile applications (apps). By using ADA’s websites and apps, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

#### 2\. Links to Other Sites

This site may provide links to other websites or resources. You acknowledge and agree that the American Diabetes Association has no control over such sites and resources and is not responsible for the availability of such external sites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Materials, advertising, products, or other materials on or available from such sites or resources. You further acknowledge and agree that the American Diabetes Association shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Materials or goods available on or through any such site or resource.

#### 3\. Monitoring of Information

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the American Diabetes Association websites and apps. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to websites or apps, new services or features offered by the American Diabetes Association, and special offers and information we think you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us through one of the channels identified in "How to Correct or Update Information" (below).

Like many website/app operators, we collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit one of our websites or use one of our mobile apps (“log data”). Log data may include information such as your computer’s internet protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser version, the pages of our site that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and other statistics.

Google Analytics is used to analyze traffic to this website. Google Analytics does not maintain individual profiles for visitors, nor does Google Analytics collect data that might identify the individual visitor. Google Analytics only collects aggregate data. Click here for more information about the Google Analytics privacy policy.

#### 4\. Protecting Personal Information

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for the American Diabetes Association are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates.

#### 5\. Collection of Personally Identifiable Information and Cookies

We collect standard information, by way of a “cookie,” to help us evaluate how our sites are being used. A cookie is a small uniquely identifiable text file that is stored on your machine. A cookie collects information that is used for statistical purposes and does not identify you in any way.

We use cookies to help personalize and maximize your online experience. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages or register for services on any of the Association’s journal websites, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password, and preferences). Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience. When you return to the website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized. We also use cookies to track click streams and for load balancing.

Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still use most of the features throughout the websites of the journals of the American Diabetes Association.

ADA, like many other non-profit organizations, occasionally makes available only our contributor names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other non-profit organizations. In addition, member and donor names are provided to a credit card vendor as part of our affinity program. These practices help us reduce costs of reaching more individuals with our diabetes-related information. These companies are carefully screened.

Names/addresses are provided on a one-time basis; therefore, these companies will not have continued access to your name and address unless you respond to them directly, which you are free to do or not to do.

You can request that we do not share your information by emailing us at [privacy@diabetes.org](mailto:privacy@diabetes.org). (If you use more than one email address, postal address or telephone number, please identify each one.)

ADA may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics include no personal identifying information.

ADA's advertising partner eHealthcare Solutions may collect and store certain information automatically when you visit our website or those website partners in the eHealthcare Solutions Network. eHealthcare Solutions may collect certain personally identifiable information you voluntarily submit on our website or on other websites who partner with eHealthcare Solutions. eHealthcare Solutions may also automatically collect and store information when you view advertisements that appear on our website. Your personally identifiable information may be used to verify the accuracy of the information you submit, and all information collected (personally identifiable and non-personally identifiable) may be used for marketing purposes, to deliver more relevant advertising and content, and to improve your overall experience at this website. Please review the eHealthcare Solutions Privacy Policy at [http://eHealthcareSolutions.com/Privacy](http://ehealthcaresolutions.com/Privacy) to obtain more about how this information is utilized. You can opt out of targeting based on your personal information or non-personally identifiable information (i.e., cookies, pixel tags, clear gifs and/or similar devices) gathered on this and other network sites by visiting [http://preferences.truste.com/2.0/?type=ehs&affiliateId=151](http://preferences.truste.com/2.0/?type=ehs&affiliateId=151) and following the instructions.

#### 6\. Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. We adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). (For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's [COPPA site](http://business.ftc.gov/privacy-and-security/children%E2%80%99s-online-privacy).)

The journal websites of the American Diabetes Association are not intended for children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information for children under 13.

Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to contact the American Diabetes Association at any time regarding privacy questions or concern. We will take steps to ensure that any person contacting us for a child's information is that child's parent or guardian.
