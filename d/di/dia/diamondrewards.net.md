# Diamond Rewards - The Rewards Program That Pays In Diamonds And Cash!

This Privacy Policy has been published to provide a clear and concise outline of how and when personal information is collected, disclosed, used, stored and otherwise handled by Diamond Rewards and its related companies ("Diamond Rewards "). The Policy relates to personal information collected by any means and by any technology.

Diamond Rewards treats the handling of your personal information very seriously. To that end, Diamond Rewards has systems and procedures in place to protect your privacy in relation to the handling of your personal information.

Diamond Rewards abides by the National Privacy Principles, which provide a scheme in relation to the collection, disclosure, use and storage of personal information. Diamond Rewards’s objective is to handle information responsibly and provide you with some control over the way information about you is handled.

## The Privacy Act provides for exemptions:

  1. in relation to employee records (being records relating to a current or former employment relationship between Diamond Rewards and the individual); and
  2. from coverage in relation to the journalism activities of Diamond Rewards.



Diamond Rewards is not required to comply with the National Privacy Principles when dealing with employee records or personal information collected in the course of its Internet activities.

## 1\. Collection of Personal Information

Personal information is information or opinion from which an individual's identity may be ascertained. The nature of personal information collected by Diamond Rewards generally comprises an individual's name and contact details (including address, phone, fax and e-mail). Such personal information is collected for the purposes of arranging, conducting and promoting Diamond Rewards's Internet activities.

Diamond Rewards also collects other types of personal information from time to time (eg. credit information and drivers licence details), and will inform you upon collecting such information the purpose for which it is being collected.

Diamond Rewards does not collect personal information unless it is necessary for Diamond Rewards to perform one or more of its functions and activities. On occasion, some of this personal information may be sensitive and Diamond Rewards will only collect it with your consent or when required to by law.

Diamond Rewards will destroy personal information when it is no longer required for such functions and activities.

Diamond Rewards  will generally collect personal information from you directly. For example, Diamond Rewards may collect personal information via telephone or letter, or when you attend a function or event, enter a competition, provide a resume or enter an agreement.

There may be other occasions when Diamond Rewards needs to source personal information from an external third party. For example, Diamond Rewards may collect personal information from credit agencies when establishing a credit account. Diamond Rewards may also collect personal information regarding potential agents or employees from recruitment agencies. Diamond Rewards may also collect personal information from call centers involved in running competitions for Diamond Rewards.

## 2\. Use & Disclosure of Personal Information

Personal information provided to Diamond Rewards may be shared with related companies within the Network, where it will be kept strictly confidential and will only be disclosed on a need to know basis.

Diamond Rewards  will use and disclose your personal information for the purpose for which the personal information was initially collected.

Diamond Rewards may also use that personal information for a purpose related to the initial purpose of collection if that other purpose would be within your reasonable expectations. Related purposes might include internal auditing and administration, adding your name to a contact list, guest list or invitation list or helping us to identify production and Internet broadcast activities which may be of benefit or interest to you.

Diamond Rewards  will not use or disclose your personal information for any other purposes without first obtaining your express or implied consent. Diamond Rewards may however be required to disclose your personal information without your consent if the disclosure is:

  1. required or authorized by law;
  2. required in order to investigate an unlawful activity;
  3. required by an enforcement body for investigative activities; or
  4. necessary to prevent a serious and imminent threat to a person's life, health or safety, or to public health or safety.



Generally, Diamond Rewards will retain your personal information within HK and not use or disclose it overseas. However, on some occasions the information may need to be transferred overseas in order to perform one of the Network's functions or activities. In these circumstances, Diamond Rewards will either obtain your express or implied consent or will use its best endeavors to ensure that your personal information will receive protection similar to that which it would have if the information were in HK.

## 3\. Direct marketing

From time to time Diamond Rewards may use your personal information to identify Internet and Internet broadcasting activities which may be of interest to you to send you information regarding Diamond Rewards’s programs and products, and those available through Diamond Rewards’s business partners.

If you do not wish to receive direct marketing information, please let Diamond Rewards know. Diamond Rewards will take immediate steps to ensure that you do not receive any direct marketing information in future.

## 4\. Personal Information Quality

Diamond Rewards 's objective is to ensure that all personal information collected by Diamond Rewards is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist Diamond Rewards in achieving its objective, please contact the Privacy Officer if any of your details change. Further, if you believe that the information Diamond Rewards holds is not accurate, complete or up-to-date, please contact the Privacy Officer in order to have the information corrected.

## 5\. Personal Information Security

Diamond Rewards is committed to keeping your personal information secure, and we will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, loss, misuse or alteration.

Your personal information may be stored in hard copy documents, or electronically on Diamond Rewards ‘s software or systems.

Diamond Rewards maintains physical security over its paper and electronic data stores, such as locks and security systems. Diamond Rewards also maintains computer and network security using passwords to control and restrict access to authorized staff for approved purposes. Where information is particularly sensitive, the information is overwritten and then manually deleted.

## 6\. Access To Personal Information

You may request access to the personal information that Diamond Rewards holds about you.

The procedure for gaining access is as follows:

  1. All requests for access to your personal information must be made in writing and addressed to the Privacy Officer.
  2. You must provide as much detail as possible regarding the business entity, department or person to whom you believe your personal information has been provided, and when. This will allow Diamond Rewards to process your request faster.

  4. You will be asked to verify your identity.
  5. A fee may apply to such access in the event that a request for access is onerous or time consuming. Such a fee will cover staff costs involved in locating and collating information, and reproduction costs.
  6. Depending on the circumstances, you may be forwarded the information by mail or email, or you may be required to personally inspect your records at the appropriate place.
  7. You will be given the opportunity to correct any personal information which is no longer accurate.



In some circumstances, Diamond Rewards may not be in a position to provide access. Such circumstances include where:

  1. access would create a serious threat to safety;
  2. providing access will have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals;
  3. denying access is required or authorized by law;
  4. the request is frivolous;
  5. legal proceedings are underway;
  6. negotiations may be prejudiced by such access; or
  7. access would reveal a commercially sensitive decision making process.



If Diamond Rewards denies access to your personal information, it will provide you with reasons in writing.
