# Privacy Policy - American Diabetes Association

* * *

###  Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

### Collection and Use of Personal Information

When you request information, order a product or service, register using one of our forms, or contact us offline, we may need your specific information in order to process your registration/request and reply to your needs promptly.

We may ask you for contact information (such as your name, email and address) and demographic information (such as your zip code or age). We also collect demographic and profile data at our site and in our databases. We use this data to tailor your experience at ADA and develop and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

In general, we use identifiable information to complete a transaction, as indicated below. In addition, we use any health-related data you provide to us to help us help you through our information, our programs and our services. Part of our mission is to improve the lives of all people affected by diabetes, and we do that by providing appropriate health information to you based upon information you personally provide. We maintain health-related data and do not provide your name and address to outside parties, except as described here. To learn more about our encryption policies, please review the section on "Protecting Personal Information."

### Links to Other Sites

This site links to other sites. The American Diabetes Association is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We will not pass your information along to the linked site; however, we cannot protect the information you provide to that site.

### Monitoring of Information

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the American Diabetes Association Web site. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web sites, new services or features offered by the American Diabetes Association, and special offers and information we think you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us through one of the channels identified in the choice/opt-out section.

WebTrends Live is used to analyze traffic to this Web site. WebTrends Live does not maintain individual profiles for visitors, nor does WebTrends Live collect data that might identify the individual visitor. WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data.

###  Protecting Personal Information

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for the American Diabetes Association are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates.

### Use of "Cookies"

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that. Even without accepting cookies, you can still use most of the features throughout the American Diabetes Association Web sites.

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement or content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

### ADA Policies Regarding Disclosure of Personal Information

ADA, like many other non-profit organizations, occasionally makes available only our contributor names and postal addresses to companies, predominantly other non-profit organizations. In addition, member names are provided to a credit card vendor as part of our affinity program. Names of Tour de Cure® participants are provided to local bike shops. These practices help us reduce costs of reaching out to more individuals with diabetes-related information. The companies with which your name may be shared are carefully screened. Names/addresses are provided on a one-time basis; therefore, these companies will not have continued access to your name and address unless you respond to them directly, which you are free to do or not to do.

You can request that we do not share your information by emailing us at [privacy@diabetes.org](mailto:privacy@diabetes.org).  (If you use more than one email address , postal address or telephone number, please identify each one.)

The American Diabetes Association may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.

### Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). (For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA site at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/adults.htm>)

### Email Guidelines

ADA does not send unsolicited commercial email to individuals with whom they do not have consent/permission or a pre-existing or current business relationship.

ADA provides all email recipients with a clear, easy and effective method to unsubscribe to any and all online communications.
