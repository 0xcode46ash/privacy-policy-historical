**Our Commitment To Privacy **

Your privacy is important to us.  To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.  To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on the  [ ]()homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

**What information do we collect? How do we use it? **

When you request information about a product or service or register with one of our sites, we may need to know specific information about you in order to process your registration/requests and reply to your needs promptly.

Our site's forms may require you to give us contact information (like your name, e-mail and address) and demographic information (like your zip code or age). We may use the contact information from these registration and survey forms to send you information about other programs or events of the American Diabetes Association. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings. See the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our sites and distribute content that we think you might be interested in.

When you order products or services from the  []() Web site, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status. To learn more about our encryption policies, please review the section on "How does the American Diabetes Association protect customer information?"

This site links to other sites. The American Diabetes Association is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We will not pass your information along to the linked site; however, we cannot protect your information if you provide information to that site.

We monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us develop the design and layout of the American Diabetes Association sites. We may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web sites, new services or features offered by the American Diabetes Association, and special offers and information we think you will find valuable. If you would rather not receive this information, please contact us through one of the channels identified in the choice/opt-out section.

WebTrends Live is used to analyze traffic to this Web site.  WebTrends Live does not maintain individual profiles for visitors, nor does WebTrends Live collect data that might identify the individual visitor.  WebTrends Live only collects aggregate data.  For more information about the WebTrends Live privacy policy, please click here  _http://www.webtrendslive.com/wtl_system/privacy_policy.htm_. 

**How does the American Diabetes Association protect customer information? **

When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. This secure server software, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer transactional data we collect is protected against unauthorized access with the use of digital certificates. Digital certificates for the American Diabetes Association are issued by VeriSign, one of the most established signers of digital certificates. To learn more about our online security, simply click on the "Security" icon (it usually appears as a padlock) in your browser tool bar, at the bottom of your browser window.

**What about "cookies?" **

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive.  Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information.  Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.  Even without accepting cookies, you can still use most of the features throughout the American Diabetes Association Web sites.

Our site may use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same advertisement or content repeatedly. We use cookies to deliver information specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site.

**Will the American Diabetes Association disclose the information it collects to outside parties? **

The American Diabetes Association may sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.  We may do so with selected third parties (e.g., information collected in conjunction with online donations); you can request that we do not by emailing us at  [privacy@diabetes.org](mailto:privacy@diabetes.org).  (If you use more than one email address, send this message from each email account you use.)  When you opt-in by giving us your email address, we may share this with other ADA offices in order to inform you about our events and programs.  Therefore, it may take more than one cycle to remove your name. The American Diabetes Association may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personal identifying information.

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy **

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important.  For that reason, we adhere to the 1998 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). (For more information, visit the Federal Trade Commission's COPPA site at  [http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/adults.htm](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/adults.htm))  Whenever we collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are under 13, we obtain parental consent before any personally identifiable information is collected, used or disclosed.  We obtain parental consent before children are allowed to post or communicate directly with others.  We avoid collecting more information than necessary when offering children's games and activities. We also follow strict rules when sending email; and we provide parents reasonable access to information collected from their children, and the ability to correct or remove that information.

**Choice/Opt-Out**

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from the American Diabetes Association and third parties, if any, at the point where we request information about the visitor.
