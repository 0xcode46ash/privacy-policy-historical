# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy

Dialog is committed to protecting your privacy. We pledge to use information about our visitors and customers responsibly. We will not sell, share, or rent this information, for commercial purposes, to any person or organization outside the Thomson Legal & Regulatory Group and its support affiliates. 

This notice applies to all information collected from or submitted to Dialog.com, its associated subdomains, and Dialog product sites. Our Web site contains links to other Web sites operated by third parties. Dialog is not responsible for the privacy practices or policies of these sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of each site you visit.

If you have any questions about Dialog.com's privacy policy, you may e-mail [dialog.privacy@thomson.com](mailto:dialog.privacy@thomson.com) or call 888-809-6193.

Information Collection and Use

Our Web site does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor. We do recognize and collect IP address, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, domain name and country/state. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitors' movement, and analyze broad demographic trends.

In order to offer and provide a customized, personal experience, Dialog uses cookies to store and help track your information. For example, we use cookies to help remind us who you are and to deliver content and services based on your account information. Cookies are simply pieces of information that are sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. The use of cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You will not be able to use Dialog products and services if you set your browser to not accept cookies.

In some areas of our site, we ask you to provide personally identifiable information. The personal information you provide will be kept confidential and used only to support your interactions with Dialog.

Registration

For downloads of Thomson company logos, software and documentation, Dialog may require visitors to register. During registration, a visitor is required to give their name, company name, address, e-mail address and phone number. This information is used to notify the visitor about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the visitor to provide demographic information such as practice area or type of firm, but is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

Newsletters and Special Promotions

If a visitor wishes to subscribe to our newsletters and special promotions, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. Dialog will not sell, share, or rent this information, for commercial purposes, to any person or organization outside the Thomson Legal & Regulatory Group and its support affiliates.

Purchases

Dialog will request name, address, and financial information to facilitate your online purchase. This information is strictly confidential. Financial information is only used for billing purposes and to complete customers' orders. We do not store credit card numbers on Dialog.com.

Information Requests

Questions and requests for information about Dialog products and services will be retained for follow up with individuals in addressing their specific inquiries. Dialog may also contact you by mail or telephone regarding information on new products and services related to that request.

Circumstances may arise where Dialog is legally required to disclose personal information to third parties such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution, or governmental investigations.

Choice/Opt-out

Dialog will send you information about our various products and services. Visitors and customers who no longer wish to receive our special e-mail promotions or newsletters may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the e-mail or by completing the form at [http://www.dialog.com/contacts/mailinglists/](https://web.archive.org/contacts/mailinglists/).

Notification of Changes

From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post and highlight the policy changes in our privacy policy on Dialog.com. 

Security

Personal information is handled with the same quality of care as all other Dialog information to ensure the integrity and security of your data. Dialog develops a variety of products and services for use by commercial customers. When you sign on to selected services, your password and user ID are automatically encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software so that they cannot be understood by a third party. When we ask users to provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of your Web browser becomes locked. You can also identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:). 

If you have any questions about Dialog.com's privacy policy, you may e-mail [dialog.privacy@thomson.com](mailto:dialog.privacy@thomson.com) or call 888-809-6193.
