# Diabetes Daily - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

We despise people that send spam or trade/sell/rent personal information:

  * **We will never send unsolicited email messages.** We use [Bloglet](http://www.bloglet.com/) to send our newsletters. Thousands of bloggers use Bloglet and have reported no abuses of their privacy policy which forbids spam.
  * **We collect general but not specific information.** We regularly look at our logs to see referring sites, browser types, screen resolutions and region of the world. We do not try to link this information to a specific name or face.
  * **We do not rent, sell or share personal information.** We will never share personal information such as your name or email address (which are necessary to post comments). However, we may offer generic information like total daily visitors to our advertising partners.
  * **We may reveal personal information if compelled by a court order.**



If you have any questions or suggestions on how to improve, please email us at [team@diabetesdaily.com](mailto:team@diabetesdaily.com). We're very friendly people.
