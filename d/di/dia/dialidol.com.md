Your privacy is important to you, I know this because my privacy is important to me. As a result your privacy is important to DialIdol. DialIdol respects that you are trusting the application to run on your computer and doesn't collect any personal information. Here is what DialIdol collects and submits back to DialIdol.com

None of the above information can be traced back to you (by DialIdol & DialIdol.com or anyone else) without subpoenaing your ISP and translating your IP address to a name. DialIdol has no choice but to allow this to happen & if I did I'd prevent it.

DialIdol & DialIdol.com does NOT know, search for, collect, track, trace or otherwise mine data other than what was disclosed in the above bullets. We especially do not collect any personal information.

In 2009 DialIdol introduced a new feature called YourPredictions. Any predictions that you make will be available for public consumption however that consumption will only trace back to your DialIdol ID, not your actual name. If you choose to divulge your actual name in DialIdol's YourPredictions/forum registration process you may also be choosing to disclose your name to the public and people may be able to search for you and any content you have submitted to DialIdol based on that information.
