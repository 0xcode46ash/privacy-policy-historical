# Privacy Policy | Dimensions Guide

**Privacy Policy**

The privacy of all visitors to Dimensions Guide is very important to us and we don’t take it lightly. 

Here at Dimensions Guide, we appreciate that your personal information is private and it is imperative to protect it. This page will help you understand what data is passed when you use and visit Dimensions Guide, and how in turn we safeguard that information.  You can rest assured that we will never sell any of your personal information a third party for any reason.

This data is used to facilitate and allow you to have greater ease when visiting our site such as being able to comment on a blog or post to one of our forums. Primarily the data collected is as follows:

**Log Files**

As is the case with many other online sites, we gather and make use of data located in log files.  Some of the information in these log files include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your Internet Service Provider (ISP), the type of browser you use to the site (for example Firefox or Internet Explorer), the exact time you visited the site and also which web pages you landed on all throughout our site. 

**Web Beacons & Cookies**

Dimensions Guide does use cookies to store information; an example of this is your personal preferences when you go to our site.  Usually this includes such things as only allowing a popup once a visit to the site or the ability to avail of some of the features of the site such as message board and forums.

You may have noticed the use of third party advertisements on Dimensions Guide which helps defray the costs of running our site. And just like Dimensions Guide, many of these advertisers in turn use the same technology mentioned above for the same purposes as we do. This may include cookies and web beacons when the advertisements are displayed on our site. 

This means that the same information and data (your IP address, your ISP, the browser you are using, and in some cases, whether you have certain plug-ins installed like Flash) will also be sent to these advertisers. A perfect example of this is Google through their Google AdSense program. 

This is not malicious; it is simply to target ads it what is called ‘geotargeting’ or in other words, showing California properties available for rent to someone in California and not visitors from Florida. Another example would be to display targeted ads based on specific web sites previously visited. An example of that would be to display automotive ads to someone who frequents automotive web sites.

You can choose to disable cookies completely or selectively turn off the use of cookies in your browser settings, or by using a third party program such as Norton Internet Security to manage your browsing preferences. 

Be warned however, this may affect how one is able to interact with not only our site but most of your Internet sites you commonly visit.  An example would be the inability to access services or login to forums and/or accounts.

As owners and operators of Dimensions Guide, we of course reserve all rights to make changes to this privacy policy. Therefore it would be beneficial for you to review this policy if concerned each time you visit Dimensions Guide to ensure you understand how any personal data you provide is used.

If you have any questions in regard to this Privacy Policy please use the contact form located [**HERE**](http://www.dimensionsguide.com/contact-us/) and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
