# Dimension Data :: Privacy Policy

**DIMENSION DATA PRIVACY POLICY**

For purposes of these terms and conditions, "Dimension Data" shall mean Dimension Data Holdings plc, and all of its direct and indirect subsidiaries.

1          Dimension Data is sensitive to the private nature of information you provide to it over the Internet and is committed to protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy explains the data collection and use practices of the Dimension Data website ("the website").  By accessing the website, you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.

2          **Information Collected**  

When you use the website, and at other times, Dimension Data may require you to provide it with personally identifiable information.  The personally identifiable information you provide may include your name, company, job title, address and e-mail address and facts about your business, profession and product preferences.  In addition, Dimension Data's web servers may automatically collect website usage information from you when you visit the website.  Website usage information informs Dimension Data about how visitors and subscribers use and navigate the websites, including the number and frequency of users to each web page, their IP address, and the length of their stays. 

3          **Use of Information Collected**  

3.1        The personal information collected on the website will be used to operate the website and to provide the services or carry out the transactions you have requested.  In support of these uses, Dimension Data may combine the personally identifiable information you have provided to it on the website with other information about you that is available to it, including website usage information and information from other sources.  Dimension Data may use this information to enable it to process, validate and verify requests for products and services and for the purposes for which you specifically provided the information; to improve your experience on the website; to improve and develop new products, features and services; to alert you to new products and services and special offers; to provide marketing with aggregate information about the user base and usage patterns; to allow Dimension Data to personalise the advertising users see based on their personal characteristics or preferences, and for other purposes.

3.2        Personal information collected from you may be stored and processed in England, or any other country in which Dimension Data operates or maintains facilities, in order to help Dimension Data to improve the content of the website, provide you with the products or services requested, and to help service providers to perform services on its behalf. By using the website, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

3.3        Dimension Data may disclose any information about you to law enforcement agencies, government officials or other authorities, as Dimension Data, in its sole discretion, believes necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

4          **Cookies   **

Like most websites, Dimension Data automatically collects information and data through the use of "cookies".  A "Cookie" is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server which enables a website to recognise repeat users, facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the website and allows a website to track usage behaviour and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.  A cookie will not provide Dimension Data with personal information, therefore, if you have not supplied Dimension Data with any personal information, you can still browse the website anonymously.  You have the ability to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, however you can modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other websites which you visit.

5          **Security   **

The personally identifiable information we collect about you is stored in limited access servers. Dimension Data maintains safeguards to protect the security, integrity, and privacy of these servers and your personally identifiable information.

6          **IP Address   **

If you are connected to the internet you will have an IP Address. This may take the form of a figure, such as 333.333.22.1. The address will be automatically collected and logged as part of the connection of your computer to Dimension Data's web server and may be used to determine the total number of visits to each part of the website. If there is a security breach the relevant IP Address will be identified by the Internet Service Provider and the user may be contacted. 

7          **Links to Other Web Sites   **

Should you make use of the external links which may be provided for your convenience, you should be aware that those websites are not subject to this Privacy Policy. Dimension Data recommends that you review the privacy policy at each such website to determine how that website protects your privacy. 

8          **Policy Modifications**

 Dimension Data may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes here, so that you are familiar with the Privacy Policy adopted by Dimension Data.  Notwithstanding the right to amend the Privacy Policy as aforesaid, Dimension Data will not use your personal information in a manner materially different from this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.
