### Privacy Policy

This privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") describes the treatment of information gathered by NeuStar, Inc. when you (“You”) use the DNS NeuStar DNS Advantage™ open recursive service (the “Service”)

INFORMATION COLLECTED  
In order to provide the Services and to maintain the quality thereof, NeuStar collects certain information regarding its customers.  NeuStar collects both non-user identifiable information, such as the date and time of each query and the domain name requested, and potentially user-identifiable information such as the IP addresses from which queries originate (non-user identifiable information and potentially user-identifiable information collectively “Information”).  NeuStar automatically gathers Information for use in the aggregate to monitor and to provide the Service and to improve Service offerings and for targeted advertising.  Aggregated Information may be compiled into statistical, demographic or other information that NeuStar may use and may share with others, to show preferences of its customer base as a whole, but not the preferences of any individual customer.  Shared, aggregated Information does not include a level of detail that will permit anyone to identify an individual customer's usage or preferences.    

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION  
Information is used for the purpose of offering and rendering the Service.  Information may be used to improve or enhance the Service and may be provided to employees, agents, partners and contractors of NeuStar for such purpose.  NeuStar discloses potentially personally-identifying information only to its employees, agents, partners and contractors that (i) need to know that such information in order to process it on NeuStar's behalf or to provide the Service and to perform related business activities expressed in this privacy statement; and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 

NeuStar is partnered with other businesses and works with them in order to provide the Service to users.  NeuStar will only share Information with such partners to the extent that is necessary for such partners to provide the Service or parts thereof.  For example, when a user uses the Service, the IP address of the user and query of the user are shared with NeuStar's advertising partners.  NeuStar requires its partners to provide the same level of privacy protection that NeuStar does.  These partners do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for a transaction which is part of the Service. 

NeuStar may disclose potentially personally-identifying where disclosure is required pursuant a request for specific customer information to comply with a Subpoena, Court Order, and/or other legal instrument, legal proceeding or relevant law and in instances when NeuStar believes in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the rights of NeuStar or third parties or there is an immediate, imminent threat to the safety of any person, NeuStar or the NeuStar Network.  You shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless NeuStar, its agents, employees partners and subsidiaries, from and against any and all claims, loss, damage, cost or expense (including attorney's fees) to the extent such claims directly arise as a result of actions taken by NeuStar pursuant to the provisions described within this Privacy Policy.

THIRD PARTIES  
The Service may permit You to link to other sites on the Internet which are not under NeuStar control.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that NeuStar does not own or control and NeuStar is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such sites.

PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES  
NeuStar may, in its sole discretion, modify, amend or change the terms and conditions of the Privacy Policy at any time.  Amendments to this Privacy Policy will be effective when posted. Your continued use of the Service following any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes acceptance of those changes
