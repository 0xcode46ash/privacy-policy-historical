# Dun & Bradstreet - Privacy

## D&B Global Web Site Privacy Policy and Data Protection Practices

### Dun & Bradstreet - An Industry Leader in Data Protection Practices

For more than 159 years, Dun & Bradstreet has collected information about businesses to create products and services that assist its customers in critical buying and selling decisions. Today, D&B is one of the world's leading providers of business-to-business credit, marketing, purchasing and receivable management services. 

Because information is our business, privacy and data protection have always been a fundamental part of how we do business. As a leader in the information industry, D&B developed and published data protection practices more than 25 years ago. 

### Data Protection Practices for the Internet

Today, with the power of the Internet, we have the exciting opportunity to deliver products and services faster and more efficiently than ever before. We also have the ability to better serve our customers by providing dnb.com users a customized experience based on their preferences. Many of the measurable benefits derived from D&B products and services and from our Web site are a result of the ability to gather information and use it. Dun & Bradstreet recognizes that the collection and free flow of information on the Internet can be troubling for some users. Therefore, we advocate that the information flows be balanced against an individual's privacy interests. The company also believes the adoption of balanced data protection practices for the Internet makes good business sense. Therefore, D&B subscribes to the practices described below. 

### Browsing the Web Site

A visitor to [www.dnb.com](http://www.dnb.com/) who is not purchasing products or services, is not required to reveal any individually identifiable information such as name, address or telephone number. 

### Use of Internet Technology and "Cookies"

Using Internet technology, dnb.com may collect information that is non-individually-identifiable such as what browser is being used (e.g., Netscape) or the domain name from which a visitor entered the site (e.g., www.your company.com or www.your university.edu). This information is used in the aggregate to administer our system and make improvements to our site. 

Though cookies have a mixed reputation, the truth is that they are used by thousands of Web sites to make your life as a Web user much easier and much more engaging. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. D&B will use cookies to make improvements and updates to the site and to better tailor services to our users' needs. We may also use cookies to provide users a personalized experience on our site. 

### Ordering Products or Services & Customer Registrations

Some pages within D&B sites require provision of individually identifiable information to order a product or to register with D&B. When this information is requested, you will know because you will be asked to complete a form and return it to us. The data requested may include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, telephone and fax numbers, as well as choices you identify for your personalized experience on the site. 

D&B collects this individually identifiable information to complete business transactions, deliver products and services, administer individual accounts, provide customer support and meet government regulatory requirements such as tax collection. 

D&B does not sell or voluntarily share the information externally. D&B does, however, from time to time compile online transaction and registration information for internal analyses such as researching and identifying market segments and needs. The company will also use this information to provide customers updates about D&B's products and services via e-mail. At the time of collection, customers will be given a choice to opt-out of receiving these e-mail updates. 

When you purchase a product or service, D&B will collect credit card information for billing purposes. This information is processed for D&B by a third party partner. That third party and D&B use security techniques, including encryption and secure servers, to protect against unauthorized access to transmitted information used for billing purposes. Neither D&B nor our third party contractor stores, uses or shares credit card information for any other purpose. 

### Business Relationships

The Dun & Bradstreet site contains links to other Web sites. Dun & Bradstreet is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

### Confidentiality and Security Safeguards

D&B takes technical, contractual, administrative and physical steps to protect against unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information. If, during their employment, D&B associates acquire confidential or proprietary information belonging to D&B or its customers, such information will be handled in confidence and may not be disclosed to unauthorized third parties. D&B associates are also responsible for the internal security of such information. On some D&B sites, technology is used to further secure the information. 

### Access and Correction Process

A customer wishing to review or update registration information or discuss billing questions can contact their local [D&B Customer Service Center](https://web.archive.org/web/20010603154106id_/http://www.dnb.com/english/contactus/default.asp). 

### Applicability of Privacy Policy and Updates

The practices outlined above represent current (as of September 2000) data protection practices. To keep up with the rapidly evolving Internet environment, D&B will from time to time review and revise these practices and communicate any updates. 

### Questions and Concerns
