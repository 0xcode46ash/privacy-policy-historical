# Learn about the Dun & Bradstreet United States Privacy Policy at dnb.com.

  
Version 1.6 June 2003  


Driven by requests from its customers, D&B delivers products and services through the Internet faster and more efficiently than ever before. The free flow of information must be balanced against data protection interests, and D&B believes that a fair balance makes good business sense. 

This Internet Privacy Policy describes the privacy policies applicable to D&B's U.S. Internet websites, [www.dnb.com](http://www.dnb.com/),  [www.dnbsearch.com](http://www.dnbsearch.com/), [sbs.dnb.com](http://sbs.dnb.com/), and [www.zapdata.com](http://www.zapdata.com/). These sites provide links to non-U.S. D&B sites that may carry different privacy notices.

**Web Site Data Collection Practices**

A visitor to the D&B's web site is not asked to reveal any individually identifiable information. We collect some information about visitors indirectly through standard web logs, including IP address, what browser is being used (e.g., Netscape), and the domain name from which a visitor entered the site (e.g., www.yourcompany.com or www.youruniversity.edu). We normally use this information in the aggregate to administer and improve our web site. Some data may be traceable to an individual, but we do not normally seek to identify individuals unless we believe that someone is using our site improperly. 

Some existing customers come to our web site with IDs and passwords already assigned. Others who register at our web site are asked to provide standard contact information, such as name, mailing and email addresses, and telephone numbers. We may also collect a credit card number from those who register through the web site to buy products and services. 

Through our web site, we provide opportunities for users to receive sales or promotional information about D&B products and services of interest to them. A user who agrees may be asked to provide contact information (e.g., name, mailing address, email address, telephone and fax number) that we will use to provide information about these products and services. 

Web site visitors may choose to submit business profile information in order to apply for a D&B D-U-N-S® Number online. The information submitted to obtain the D&B D-U-N-S® Number becomes a part of the D&B database of business information, which is the core of D&B's high quality business information products and services. Being listed in the D&B database offers benefits to businesses, including identification and recognition in the marketplace. 

**Cookies**

We sometimes use an Internet device called a cookie to store login or other information on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to simplify your access and to tailor our services to your needs and interests. For some services, we offer users the choice of having an ID or password stored in a cookie so that you do not need to re-enter it when you return to the site. 

We use a third-party contractor to monitor how our guests use our web site and to determine which of our online features they prefer. To provide this service, our contractor uses cookies on our behalf to report information about our customers and the products and services they order, as well as aggregated, non-identifiable information about our guests' use of our site, solely for our internal use. For further information, including how to opt out, visit <http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html>. We do not store credit card numbers in cookies. No other site can read a cookie set by D&B, and we cannot read a cookie that another web site wrote to your computer. Most Internet browsers are set to accept cookies. Users can reset browsers to refuse cookies and still use our web site, although access may be slower and less convenient. 

**Use, Disclosure, and Choice**

Personally-identifiable information is used and disclosed as described below.

D&B collects individually identifiable information from registered users to complete business transactions, fill and confirm orders for products and services, administer individual accounts, updating D&B's databases, provide customer support and meet government regulatory requirements. Users may be contacted as necessary for these purposes. We ask each registered user to choose whether to receive promotional email updates about products and services offered by D&B, and we will honor the choices made. 

D&B relies on various service providers and other contractors to support its Internet sites and D&B's business operations. D&B shares information with contractors who directly support the Internet services and who only use the information on our behalf in accordance with this policy. We also share information with credit card processors, auditors, lawyers or other contractors, but we require that recipients use the information only on our behalf for the purpose of the disclosure and that they destroy or return the information when it is no longer needed. These third parties? own privacy notices govern any information that they may collect on their own. When necessary or appropriate, we may disclose information in response to a court order or subpoena or when otherwise legally required. We may also disclose information as appropriate to protect our web site or legal rights, or in connection with a sale or merger involving the D&B assets or businesses for which the information is maintained. 

D&B's business information products are licensed to authorized resellers and third party users for various business decisionmaking purposes. A company representative who registers at the web site may be offered an opportunity to obtain a D&B D-U-N-S® Number for the company and may also be added to our database. Any person included in the D&B database may ask to be excluded from business lists licensed for marketing purposes. For more information, contact [D&B Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/us/customer_service/index.html). 

From time to time, D&B compiles online transaction and registration information for internal analyses such as researching and identifying market segments and needs. 

**Confidentiality and Security Safeguards**

D&B takes technical, administrative and physical steps to protect against anticipated hazards such as unauthorized access to and disclosure of individually identifiable information. D&B does not store users? personally-identifiable information on its web servers. D&B employees who handle confidential or proprietary information must treat it confidentially and may not disclose it to unauthorized third parties. D&B employees are also responsible for the internal security of the information. Employees who violate D&B's privacy policies are subject to a range of disciplinary actions. 

**Data Quality**

Data quality is at the heart and soul of any successful information company. Working to ensure that data are up-to-date and accurate benefits the data subject and D&B. To help ensure quality data, D&B employs extensive measures, including direct contacts with businesses and quality review at both the point of collection and at the end of the data collection process. 

**Access and Correction**

D&B is developing a system to allow a registered user to access and correct an Internet registration record online. In the meantime, users may contact [D&B Customer Service](https://web.archive.org/us/customer_service/index.html) to see or change an Internet registration record, opt out of receiving email updates about D&B products and services, or to be removed from the D&B database. 

**Updates to D &B's Data Protection Practices for the Internet**

To keep up with the rapidly evolving Internet environment, D&B will from time to time review and revise these practices and communicate any updates. Minor changes may be made at anytime without notice. We will update the version number and date of the notice when such changes are made. If we make a major change in the way that we use, disclose or protect Internet registration information, we will highlight the change in this notice and will provide advance notice of the change on the web site.
