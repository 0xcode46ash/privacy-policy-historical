Development Dimensions International (DDI) designed and manages the site you are viewing. DDI provides a range of Internet-based tools to support the corporate Human Resources function.

DDI is a Participant in the TRUSTe Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to advance privacy and trust in the networked world.  As this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices monitored for compliance by TRUSTe. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact us at [privacyofficer@ddiworld.com](mailto:privacyofficer@ddiworld.com).  If your inquiry is not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>.  TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

DDI International complies with the EU Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union.  This Privacy Statement covers all the DDI Web Sites listed in Appendix A.  Because DDI wants to demonstrate its commitment to our users' privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices periodically reviewed for compliance.

This Privacy Statement covers only information that is collected through the Web Sites ("Sites") covered by this Statement and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the Sites.

## Information Collection

DDI or our clients are the owners of the information collected on the Sites covered by this Privacy Statement. DDI collects information from our users at several different points on the Sites.

Clients use the Sites to collect candidate/applicant information regarding a specific job posting or opening.  There is no direct relationship between the client’s site and the Sites, although at a client’s request client sites may link to content on the Sites.

In order to use full functionality offered by the Sites, a user may be required to provide certain Personal Information (PII) such as name and email address.  We do not automatically collect any personal data that can identify you without your having prepared and submitted it.  PII information may be shared and used by DDI and the client for which the site is hosted as well as any other 3rd party vendors secured by the client to facilitate candidate or employee assessment or selection processes.

Information collected is never sold to third parties nor shared without prior consent.

For sites where you have a user account, you are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user name and password. If you believe that confidentiality has been compromised, contact privacyofficer@ddiworld.com.

## Information Use

DDI will not use individual records or other data in a manner that identifies individuals or client organizations as the source of the data, except for the purposes for which they are collected.

Data summaries aggregated across many participants and client organizations may be prepared for broader system evaluation and improvement, and for the development of assessment norms.  Innovations and improvements derived from these analyses are used to improve DDI's current and future assessment systems and tools.

Summaries of these aggregated analyses may be presented to public audiences (e.g., at scientific conferences).  Review of our general approaches and accumulated results with professional audiences ensures that DDI's assessment methods remain up-to-date with best practices and professional, technical, and legal standards.  In these summaries, individual client organizations and participant identities remain completely confidential, and results (due to aggregation) cannot be linked to individuals or client organizations.

Summaries of aggregated data may also be used to create normative profiles for assessments.  Normative profiles will not identify individuals but may identify some or all of the client organizations that are contained within the profile for the purpose of defining the characteristics of the norm sample.  Organization names will not be cited unless 5 or more organizations contribute to the aggregated profile.  At no time will normative profiles be used that allow an individual's or contributing organization's data to be identified as such.

## Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user.  Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site except when personal information is stored on a voluntary basis through the process of logging into the Site with a user name and password, in which case the information can be used to pre-populate user information into form fields presented by the Site.

The Sites use both session cookies and persistent cookies.

For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the users' experience on the Sites. Persistent cookies can be removed by following the instruction outlined in the user's Internet browser Help. More information on cookies and the use of cookies by Web Sites can be found at [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/).

## Log Files

Like most standard Web Site servers we use log files to collect statistical information about how our Sites are used.  This information includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring / exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.

The information we collect is used to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. The data is not linked to personally identifiable information.  We may choose to track the above log file information against individual user profiles only when the user has voluntarily set a uniquely identifiable cookie by logging on with a user name and password to the Sites.

## Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement.  For instance, if one or more of our Sites is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email.  Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

## Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account we reply via email or phone, in accordance with the user's wishes.

## Sharing

Though we make industry standard and reasonable effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Sites.  We do not share personal information with Third Parties except as otherwise noted in this Statement.

## Third Party Intermediaries and Service Providers

In order to provide certain services to you, we may on occasion supplement the personal information you submitted to us with information from third party sources such as for background checks.  We also partner with other third parties to provide specific services or functionality to our Sites (ex: live chat).  We only share the essential information necessary for the third party to provide these services.  These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.  We do not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.

## Business Transitions

In the event another company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquiring DDI, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred.  Data collected via some Sites, however, belong to our client organizations and would not be considered an asset to be transferred without prior consent.

## Choice/Opt-out

Users who provide information requested by the Sites, or who continue to use the Sites after having an opportunity to review this Privacy Statement, thereby consent to the terms of this Privacy Statement and to DDI's use of the information it collects as described in this Privacy Statement. Those who do not agree to this Privacy Statement may not use the Site.

## Links

Sites can contain links to other sites. Please be aware that DDI is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Sites and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every Web Site that collects personally identifiable information.

This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by the Sites.

## Security

The Sites take industry standard and reasonable precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Sites, their information is protected both online and offline.  When you enter sensitive information on our Sites, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

The servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment in a locked facility.  Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.  Those employees are required to respect the confidentiality of our visitor's personal data.

## Acceptable Use

This section applies to the software systems and all related electronic or printed Help and documentation accessed via the Sites ("Software").

Users are granted nonexclusive, nontransferable permission to access and display the Software on their computer screens and to generate outputs from the Software as designed and intended per descriptions in the Software's relevant documentation.  Users acknowledge that DDI will not be liable or held at fault for any performance or operational problems resulting from non-conformance to the published technical specifications necessary for access to the Software.   DDI shall not be liable or held to be in default of performance or operational obligations due to any technical or design problem within the electronic network which compromises users' access to the public Internet.

Neither the Software nor the hard-copy outputs generated from the Software may be used by or disclosed to third parties except as may be required in connection with inquiries by government or regulatory authorities.

Except as expressly authorized herein, users shall not: (i) copy the Software in whole or in part; (ii) reverse compile, reverse assemble, or access with intent to "hack" all or any portion of the Software; (iii) distribute, market, rent, lease, provide access to, or transfer the Software to third parties; or (iv) modify the Software except as otherwise provided. No license, right, or interest in any DDI trademark, trade name, or service mark is granted hereunder.

## Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating PII

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information as noted below.

Contact the technical support staff via eMail or phone as designated on the site. We will respond to your request within 30 days of receiving the request.

## Changes to the Privacy Statement

We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement.  When we do, we will post those changes on the Sites, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on the Sites for 30 days.

## Protection of Children's Information

The Sites do not publish content or collect data that is directed at children.

## Complaints Resolution

If you are concerned about how your personal information is being used, you have a right to complain and to expect your complaint to be handled in a sensitive and effective manner.  At any time, you can contact us to inquire about the handling, use or disclosure of your personal information by sending an email to the persons listed under Contact Information.  We will investigate your complaint and advise you of the outcome of the investigation in a timely manner.

## Use Guidelines and Rules

You agree not to use the Internet Sites to send or post in the forums or any place on the Internet Sites any message or material that (a) is unlawful, harassing, defamatory, abusive, threatening, harmful, vulgar, obscene, profane, sexually oriented, threatening, racially offensive, inaccurate, or otherwise objectionable material, or (b) encourages conduct that could constitute a criminal offense, give rise to civil liability or otherwise violate any applicable local, state, national or international law or regulation or these Terms of Service.  DDI reserves the right to delete any such material from the Internet Sites.

You agree not to post or use the Internet Sites to distribute or send any illegal material of any kind, including but not limited to, illegal material in the form of text, graphics, video, programs or audio.  Posting content or participating in any forum with the intention to commit any illegal activity is strictly prohibited.

You acknowledge that (a) DDI permits access to content that is protected by copyrights, trade-marks and other intellectual and proprietary rights ("Rights"), (b) these Rights are valid and protected in all media and technologies existing now or later developed, and (c) except as explicitly provided otherwise, the Terms of Service and applicable copyright, trademark and other laws govern your use of such content. You may not post to the Sites, copy, reproduce, retransmit, distribute, publish, commercially exploit or otherwise transfer any material subject to any Rights.  The burden of determining that any information, software, images or any other content on the Web Site that is not protected by Rights rests with you.  You acknowledge that DDI may acquire Rights to use any posted materials as described below, and that you will not acquire any of those Rights by downloading such materials.

By submitting content, which shall include your member name, to any public area of the Internet Sites, including message boards and forums, you grant DDI and its affiliates a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, communicate to the public, perform and display the con-tent (in whole or in part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such content.  You also warrant that the holder of any Rights has completely and effectively waived all such rights and validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant the license stated above.  You also permit any subscriber to access, display, view, store and reproduce for personal use (but not to republish) such content.  Subject to the foregoing, the owner of such content placed on the Web Site retains any and all Rights that may exist in such content.

If you find changes in these terms in some way that unacceptable, you should discontinue your use of DDI Discussion Forums.

## Email A Colleague

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a colleague about our Sites, we will ask you for your colleague’s name and email address.  We will automatically send your colleague a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site.  DDI stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your colleague can contact us at webmaster@ddiworld.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

## Submit Your Resume for Careers Opportunities

If you choose to use our online resume submission service to apply for a career opportunity with DDI and in order to be considered for a Career Opportunity with DDI, we require you to supply your cover letter, an attached resume document (including latest address, phone, and email information), and the DDI regional office(s) to which you wish to submit your resume.

We will automatically send you a one-time email confirming that resume submission. DDI stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email and tracking your resume submission. 

You can contact us at resumes@ddiworld.com to request that we remove this information from our database.

## Profiles

Information provided by users of the Sites is stored in a user profile.  Subsequently collected information related to that user profile that we collect through cookies, log files, and/or third parties is tied to the profile to improve the content of the site for the user.  This profile is used to tailor a user’s visit to the Sites and to direct pertinent content to them.

We purchase third party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent information we think our users would be interested in.  We use this information to enhance or overlay the `profile' of individual users.  This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable information.

We do not share your profile with other third parties.

## Widgets

Widgets support functions that require that you disclose certain personally identifiable information given the user's choice of participation. This information is collected in many different ways such as: forms, surveys, contests, forums, subscribing or unsubscribing to mailings and correcting or updating personally identifiable information and are only used for the purpose in which they were collected.

## Blogs, Chat Rooms, Message Boards, and Public Forums

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on blogs, message boards, through email, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, by posting personal information online that is publicly accessible, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.

## Information Use

Site visitors provide all personal information on a voluntary basis through visible means of data entry or collection.  Any personal information, such as your email and/or postal addresses, telephone numbers and other data, becomes available to DDI only when voluntarily submitted by you.  Once DDI receives such information, it is sent to the particular office at DDI that is equipped to respond to your request or comment. We do not rent, sell, or exchange information about you to third parties, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement.

DDI may also use such information to provide advance notice of events and new products and services.  DDI does not share any personally identifiable information with any other individual or organization for any purpose, except as otherwise noted in this privacy statement.  DDI uses the collected information to improve the content of our Web Site, to enhance existing products and services, and to communicate with you more effectively. However, despite all best efforts, Internet and email communications are never 100% confidential, and it is possible that information transmitted to us may be read or obtained by other parties. We do not release any of your information for any purpose other than its intended use.

## Online Customer Service Chat Cookies

Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider uses cookies to link profile information (submitted by individuals wishing to contact DDI) with the ongoing chat sessions managed by DDI's client representatives (operators).  By setting a cookie, users do not have to enter their profile information more than once, thereby saving time while on the chat session. Other statistical information about how our Web sites are used is collected to assist the user with their customer service experience.

## Search Engine Cookies

Our third party business service provider uses cookies to link visits to our site with click-through from pay-per-click sponsored ads, placed by DDI on external search engine sites.  They work by placing a cookie on a user's computer when he/she clicks on one of our pay-per-click sponsored ads.  Then, if the user reaches one of DDI's designated conversion pages, the cookie is connected to our web page.  When a match is made, the third party business service provider records a successful conversion for DDI. 

Some of our third party business service providers (e.g., aggregate traffic analytic services such as Google Analytics, search engines and live help chat) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies.

Our third party business service provider does not associate a user's search activity with his/her ad click history. The information collected is only in aggregate form and is not tied to any personal information.  Users who don't want to participate in tracking activities can not accept this cookie by setting their Internet browser user preferences.  These users will simply not be included in our conversion tracking statistics.

This Privacy Statement covers the use of cookies by the Sites and does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties.

## Newsletter Subscriptions

DDI’s third party newsletter publishing service provider for managing email newsletter subscriptions collects and stores visitor information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI.  This information includes, but is not limited to, email address lists, articles, survey answers, letters, and usage statistics.

This information is owned by DDI and is not accessible to any other third parties.

## Online Customer Service Chat

DDI’s third party online customer service chat service provider collects and stores user information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI to manage online chat sessions.

If using this function, users will be asked to enter their names in whatever format or detail they prefer.  During the chat, users enter into a live question and answer session with a DDI operator.  Our third party online customer service chat asp service provider maintains dialogue transcripts of these chats.  After the chat, users may be asked to fill out an exit survey in order to obtain valuable feedback about DDI service.  Filling out the exit survey is completely voluntary. The surveys may ask for contact information and for demographic information.  Data is also collected through aggregated tracking information from cookies.  Our third party online customer service chat service provider uses the information they collect to improve the service they provide to DDI.  No information is shared with other third parties.

## Online Surveys

DDI’s third party online survey provider collects and stores user information in a secure and private manner on behalf of DDI to manage online surveys.  This provider allows DDI to create surveys and questionnaires for distribution to potential survey respondents.

Our third party online survey service provider maintains respondent information that may include information about DDI survey recipients, and other demographics and data useful to DDI.  Our third party online survey provider uses the information they collect to improve the service they provide to DDI.  No information is shared with other third parties.
