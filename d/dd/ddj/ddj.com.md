## When does Dr. Dobb's Journal disclose customer information to third parties?

Dr. Dobb's Journal may disclose certain identifying information about you to third parties under the circumstances described below.

Private information: We treat your e-mail address and fax number as private information that might not ordinarily be known to others and we do not share this information with third parties unless you have consented to such disclosure or such disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Dr. Dobb's Journal web site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public. When you as a customer have given us permission we may make your e-mail address available to other companies and organizations whose products or services we think might be of interest to you. If, subsequently, you do not want us to use your e-mail address for communications concerning _Dr. Dobb's Journal_ products and services, and/or be shared with other companies or organizations, please let us know. (Information on how to contact us is provided below.)

Personal information: We consider other personal identifying information you provide (such as your name, mailing address and telephone number), any optional information you provide (such as your job title and/or other demographics), and your computer's IP address to be personal information but also a type of information that would generally be available to others. Unless you tell us otherwise, we may provide this information to our business partners and to certain select third parties. From time to time, we make our customer addresses and telephone number lists available to other companies and organizations whose products or services we think you might find interesting. If you do not wish to receive information from other companies or organizations, please let us know. (Information on how to contact us is provided below.) As with private information, personal information also may be disclosed if disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process; (2) protect and defend our rights and property; (3) protect our members, subscribers, or registrants from misuse or unauthorized use of the Dr. Dobb's Journal web site; or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our members, subscribers, registrants, or the public. (Among other things, this means that if you provide false membership, subscription or registration information, or if you attempt to pose as someone else, both private and personal information about you-including your computer's IP address-may be disclosed as part of any investigation into your actions.) 

Aggregate information: _Dr. Dobb's Journal_ sometimes provides aggregate usage or tracking information to third parties. This aggregate information does not contain user-specific information that reveals the identity of a member, subscriber or registrant. We may share this information with anyone since it does not personally identify you and is not correlated to your personal identifying information.

Information you choose to disclose to third parties: From time to time, _Dr. Dobb's Journal_ may allow third parties to advertise on our web sites, or may provide links to sites we think may be of interest to you. If you choose to disclose personal identifying information directly to one of our advertisers or to a web site to which we have linked, the information you disclose will be subject to that advertiser's or that web site's privacy policy, if any. We also may allow third parties to sponsor or co-sponsor contests, promotions or surveys on our web sites. In order to enter a contest, promotion or survey, you may be asked to provide personal identifying information, and by doing so you agree that such information may be disclosed to the sponsor of the contest, promotion or survey. Any information you choose to submit will be subject to the sponsor's privacy policy, if one exists. Although _Dr. Dobb's Journal_ encourages third parties to adhere to appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions or policies of such parties. 

Information you choose to disclose publicly: Finally, if you knowingly provide personal identifying information such as your user name or e-mail address in a chat or bulletin board area, you should be aware that the information provided can be collected and used by others visiting that area.
