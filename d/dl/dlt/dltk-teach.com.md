# Privacy

We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, or e-mail address. However, we do obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider people use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (Macintosh or Windows, for example).  This helps us to determine what our pages will look like on your browser (in an attempt to make sure the templates and other images are viewable and printable for everyone).  Er, just to be clear... this information is not specific -- we know that 30% of the people who visit use such and such a browser and 25% of the people who visit use Windows 95, etc... not that Jane uses Windows Explorer and Jimmy uses a MacIntosh.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here [ http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information (example, your name as a signature on an email asking for help understanding a project).  This is completely your choice and is not a requirement in corresponding with us.  Again, if you do choose to share this info,  we do not sell or give this information to anyone. 

There are a few features on our site that we have offered in conjunction with a third party because we do not have the expertise to create these ourselves.  Because they are provided by third parties we do not control the technical backbone so you may wish to refer to the privacy policy of these third parties to be sure you are comfortable with the way they may handle the information you are providing.  Here are some links: 

In some cases, you may be able to use these third party features without providing any personal information.
