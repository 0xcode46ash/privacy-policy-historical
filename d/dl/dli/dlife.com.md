# Privacy Policy - dLife.com - For Your Diabetes Life

  
www.dlife.com  
  
Welcome www.dlife.com (collectively the "Website") operated by or on behalf of LifeMed Media, Inc., a Delaware corporation located at 101 Franklin Street, Westport, CT 06880 ("dLife", "we", "our", or "us"). This privacy policy is intended to inform you about how your personally identifiable information ("PII") and other information is collected and used by us in operating the Website. 

How does the Website work?   
  
The Website offers visitors ("you" or "your") the opportunity to browse the Website and use certain features on the Website. By using the Website, you consent to the collection and use of your PII by dLife as described herein. dLife reserves the right to change how we handle the information we collect through the Website at any time. We will update this privacy policy to reflect any changes in our privacy collection and handling practices, and will indicate that changes to this privacy policy have been made by listing a new date under “Last Modified” at the end of this privacy policy. Such changes will take effect immediately once they are posted to the Website. 

What type of PII does dLife collect from you and how do we use it?   
  
dLife does not require you to provide us with any PII in order to use the Website. Unless you provide PII to dLife through the Website, we will not collect any PII from you. However, in order to sign-up for newsletters, participate in sweepstakes and participate in certain features like message boards and other chat features, you will need to provide certain PII to us. We will share your PII with our service providers who assist us in fulfilling requests made by you. 

We also may share your PII with third parties for direct marketing and other purposes, and you acknowledge that the handling of your PII by such third parties will not be governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you would rather us not share your PII with any third party for direct marketing purposes, please either (1) do not submit PII to us or (2) indicate your desire for us not to share your PII with third parties for direct marketing purposes (an “Opt-Out Request”)as follows: (i) click on the “My Profile” tab, (ii) select the “Edit MY Profile” link, and (iii) uncheck the checkbox that says “Yes! I would like to opt in for information from dLife partners” under the heading “dLife Offers and Promotions”. Please note that it may take several weeks for us to comply with your Opt-Out Request, and until we are able to comply with such request we may continue to use your PII as described in this Privacy Policy. Please note that after receiving your Opt-Out Request, we may continue to maintain your name and other PII to help us ensure that we can honor such request, to communicate to you about your account, and for other purposes not related to direct marketing. 

Please note that if we receive your Opt-Out Request after having shared your PII with a third party for direct marketing purposes or having otherwise transferred or disposed of your PII, we may not have the ability to control the use of such PII by any third party, and in such an event you agree that we shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with the use of such PII by any such third party or resulting from any such transfer or disposition. If you are concerned about us sharing your PII with third parties or otherwise transferring or disposing your PII, you should not provide your PII to us.

We take no responsibility for PII that you post to publicly viewable portions of the Website (like message boards). Please think carefully before posting any PII to such parts of the Website.

We will also release your PII to third parties if we believe the release of such information is necessary (i) to comply with the law (e.g. a legal process or a statutory authorization), (ii) to protect or enforce our rights, or (iii) as part of a reorganization, consolidation, merger, or transfer of substantially all of the assets of dLife. 

What other information does dLife collect?   
  
We also may collect anonymous and aggregate information from you about your preferences in navigating the Website by using cookies, action tags and other methods. Cookies are small text files that identify your computer. We may use cookies to, among other things, monitor Website usage, customize Website features, identify your computer's operating system and browser, and complete transactions. An action tag is a small, graphic image on a webpage that is designed to allow a website owner or a third party to monitor who is visiting a website by collecting the IP address of the computer to which the tag is sent, the URL of the webpage that the tag comes from and the time that such webpage was viewed. Tags may be associated with cookie information. We may also use such non-PII for promotional purposes. 

If you do not want us to track such non-PII about you, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse cookies when your browser alerts you to their presence. You can also adjust the settings in your browser to refuse all cookies. Please keep in mind that if you make such adjustments, you may not be able to use certain features of the Website.

How is PII protected?

We care about the safety and security of your PII. While we take commercially reasonable precautions to safeguard PII provided to us, we cannot guarantee that such information will not be lost, disclosed or accessed by accidental circumstances or by the unauthorized acts of others. 

Does dLife provide links to other websites?

dLife may provide links to other websites or resources of possible interest to you. Because we do not control unaffiliated websites to which we provide links, the collection and use of your PII and other information by such websites shall be subject to the policies and procedures of such websites and not this privacy policy. 

What are our policies regarding children?

dLife does not knowingly collect PII from anyone under thirteen (13) years of age. 

Do we have a mechanism to address questions and complaints about the handling of information that we collect?  
  
If you have questions or concerns about any of our information collection or handling practices, or if you wish to change or remove any PII provided to us, please contact us by e-mail at  or by postal mail at dLife, a LifeMed Media, Inc., 101 Franklin Street, Westport, CT 06880 ATTN: David Lee.
