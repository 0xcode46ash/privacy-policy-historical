Below we've provided answers to questions that might be on your mind regarding privacy. You may be wondering...

**What kind of customer information do we have, and where did we get it?** **  
** Much of the customer information that we have about you comes directly from you. You gave some of this information to us on your application or request for insurance or other products we offer. We keep information about the types of products and services you purchase from us, as well as account balances and payment history.

Depending on the nature of the transaction you are completing with us, you may be asked to provide information to DurAmerica, our affiliates, agencies, or other entities working on DurAmerica’s behalf. The kinds of customer information you may be asked to provide could include: information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, and Social Security number; and information about your transactions with our affiliates, others, or us-for example, your policy coverage, premiums, and payment history.

We also may collect information from outside sources, including consumer reporting agencies. This information includes loss information reports, motor vehicle reports & credit reports.

**What do we do with customer information?** **  
** Encompass does not sell customer information to anyone. Nor do we share it with companies or organizations outside of DurAmerica that would use that information to contact you about their own products and services. If that practice were ever to change, we would, of course, offer you the ability to opt out of this type of information sharing, and we would offer you the opt-out with plenty of time for you to respond before the change in our practice took place.

To help you with your overall insurance program, your agent or broker may use customer information for marketing purposes. We may also use customer information to communicate with you about products, features, and options you have expressed an interest in or that we believe may be of interest to you. To transact business on your behalf, we may find it necessary to provide customer information, without authorization but only as permitted or required by law, to persons or organizations both inside and outside of DurAmerica. These include, for example: our affiliated companies, companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or other financial institutions with which we have a joint marketing agreement for the sale of our own products, and your agent or broker.

**How do we protect your customer information?** **  
** When we share customer information with companies working on DurAmerica’s behalf, we expect those companies to use that information only to provide the service we have asked them to perform. Within DurAmerica, customer information is available to those individuals who may need to see it to fulfill and service the needs of DurAmerica’s customers. We communicate regarding the need to protect customer information to all employees and agents, especially those individuals who have access to it. Plus, we've established physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect customer information.

Finally, should your relationship with DurAmerica end, your customer information will remain protected in accordance with our privacy practices as outlined in this Important Notice.

**How can you find out what information we have about you?** **  
** You may request to either see, or obtain from us by mail, the customer information about you in our records. If you believe that information is incomplete or inaccurate, you may request that we make any necessary corrections, additions or deletions to the disputed customer information. To fulfill your request, we may make arrangements with an insurance support organization or a consumer reporting agency to copy and disclose customer information to you on our behalf. Please send any of the requests listed above in writing to: DurAmerica Brokerage Inc, 34-11 Broadway, Astoria, NY 11106.
