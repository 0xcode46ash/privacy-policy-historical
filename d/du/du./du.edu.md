# University of Denver -- Privacy Policy

  |  |   |   | 

### I. GENERAL STATEMENT.

PRIVACY is a word that conjures up strong convictions and an emotional reaction from many of us. In the modern world, however, wondrous forms of electronic communication render the protection of privacy interests much more difficult. We in the university community are not immune from the lure of convenience and speed when we utilize our information technology and electronic communication tools. It is, of course, part of our mission to share knowledge and to collaborate within our academic community. In doing so, however, we must recognize that these modern devices are never completely secure. It is a fact of life that all computer systems and communication systems are the subject of constant probing by outsiders ranging from the curious to the criminal. 

The University of Denver will always endeavor to take reasonable precautions to maintain privacy and security within the sphere of operations. The University cannot guarantee that these efforts will always be successful and, therefore, users must assume the risk of a breach of University privacy and security systems. Individuals are advised to be discreet and cautious in their use of our systems. The University of Denver Privacy Guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified in the discretion of the University. These changes will be posted on this site. 

### II. PERSONAL INFORMATION.

The University of Denver recognizes and respects the importance of confidentiality and security of personal information in this increasingly open electronic age. The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, outside the scope of ordinary University functions, your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, or other information you provide. While the University makes reasonable efforts to protect information provided to us, we cannot guarantee that this information will remain secure and are not responsible for any loss or theft. 

### III. USE OF UNIVERSITY EQUIPMENT AND SOFTWARE

When an individual is connected to the University of Denver network or uses a University-owned computer, or other University-owned equipment, he/she agrees to abide by the rules and regulations of the University (see the University Acceptable Use Policy incorporated herein by this reference). While the University of Denver respects the desire and need for privacy in this setting, the University reserves the right, at all times, to search any and all hardware or software owned by the University, or connected to the University network, for the purposes of preventing or investigating improper or illegal use of University systems, or preventing or investigating system problems or efficiencies. In the course of an individual's involvement with the University community, software or third party systems that are used may require the individual to divulge private or personal information. The University is not responsible for the content, use or privacy of this information. 

### IV. UNIVERSITY WEBSITE(S). 

When users visit the University of Denver website(s), the webmaster collects information concerning their Internet connection, which pages they visit on the site, the Internet Protocol Number (IP) from which they accessed du.edu, and other general information about their visit to the website. (Information associated with an individual IP Number may be used for internal diagnostics and investigation of misconduct or security issues.) The collection of this information is intended to help the University deliver efficient and useful service and it may be used to analyze trends, create summary statistics for determining technical design specifications, and to otherwise aid in monitoring system performance. Such information is stored on a temporary basis and the University will exercise reasonable care to release it only if legally mandated by law enforcement investigators, required by court proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal investigations of violations of University rules and regulations. The University does not intend to sell, swap, rent, or otherwise disclose for commercial purposes, information regarding the behavior, habits, or demographics of those who visit University controlled websites. Certain parts of the University website(s) may require cookies or other tracking techniques to follow the users progress through courses, materials or programs or to verify information acquired from other sources. The University provides links to websites outside the du.edu network and is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of any website to which it may link. 

### V. E-MAIL. 

The University does not intend to monitor the contents of e-mail sent to or from University servers, except to identify and correct problems with E-mail delivery or receipt, to work with email system problems, or to deal with misconduct or security issues. Electronic logs of who sends and receives e-mail through University servers are maintained for a short period of time. This information may be used to analyze trends, create summary statistics for internal planning purposes, and to otherwise aid in maintaining system performance and security. E-mail related information is stored on a temporary basis and may only be released if legally mandated by law enforcement investigators, required by court proceedings, or it is deemed necessary to internal investigations of violations of University rules and regulations. The names and e-mail addresses of University of Denver students, faculty, and staff are available in a searchable index. An individual may opt out of this index and have his/her name removed by contacting the Webmaster at [webmaster@du.edu.](mailto:webmaster@du.edu)

## APPENDIX A   
UNIVERSITY OF DENVER  
STUDENT HEALTH SERVICE  


### POLICY REGARDING CONFIDENTIALITY OF MEDICAL INFORMATION/RECORDS 

  1. Unless otherwise required by law, confidentiality of any and all medical and mental health information about Student Health and Counseling Center patients, active and inactive, must be maintained at all times, except when a request is made for release of that information by appropriately executed written consent of the patient. In urgent situations, witnessed and properly documented verbal consent may be appropriate. 
  2. In the case of patients less than 18 years of age, medical information may be released without consent to parents or legal guardians. However, medical information of a sensitive nature, i.e., information regarding sexually transmitted diseases, contraception, pregnancy, abortion, etc., **may not** be released without patient consent. Mental health information may not be released without specific consent. When a question exists as to whether or not medical or mental health information may be released to the parent or legal guardian, the Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s representative, should be consulted before release of information occurs. 
  3. "Medical and mental health information" includes all information present in the medical or mental health record, information given or received over the telephone, by facsimile, e-mail, or other forms of communication, and medical or mental health information acquired formally or informally by any means within and outside the Student Health and Counseling Center on a Student Health and Counseling Center patient. 
  4. “Medical/mental health information” includes, but is not limited to, information about a patient’s physical or mental health condition, drug and alcohol use, and HIV status. 
  5. Medical and mental health information may be released without documented patient consent to a provider treating a patient on an emergency basis.
  6. Information about whether or not a patient has been seen (“yes” or “no”) at the Student Health and Counseling Center for medical reasons cannot usually be released without patient consent, and request for that information should be evaluated and answered only on a case-by-case basis. For example, it might be appropriate to tell a coach or athletic trainer who has referred an athlete to the Student Health and Counseling Center for treatment whether or not the student has been seen. However, no other information can be given about the visit(s) without patient consent (if consent is present in the Department of Athletics and Recreation, it should be faxed over before the information is released). Other requests for information about whether or not a student has been seen should be referred to the Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s representative, if patient consent is not available. **No** information about whether or not a student has been seen for **mental health** reasons should ever be given without specific patient consent, except to referring counselors/providers. 
  7. Subpoenas for medical or mental health records, no matter how official in appearance, do not automatically trigger release of records. The Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s representative, must be consulted before any release of medical or mental health records consequent to a subpoena. 
  8. Requests for medical or mental health information about a patient from law enforcement officers, campus security officers, governmental agencies, etc., do not automatically allow release of that information. The Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s representative, must be consulted before such information is released when written patient consent is not available. 
  9. The release of information regarding MMR immunization status to the Registrar or other University officials is allowed without patient consent.
  10. Exceptions to the above policy/procedures may apply if a true medical or psychiatric emergency exists. These rare exceptions must be handled on a case-by-case basis and, whenever possible, be approved by the Student Health and Counseling Center Director or the Director’s designated representative. 
  11. Whenever a request for release of medical or mental health information, written or verbal, generates questions about the appropriateness of that release and/or the situation is not addressed by the above policy/procedures, the Student Health and Counseling Center Director, or the Director’s representative, should be consulted before release of information occurs. 
  12. Any release of medical or mental health information about a Student Health and Counseling Center patient or discussion of that information in any forum outside the Student Health and Counseling Center without proper authorization as described above constitutes a breach of confidentiality. 
  13. Such breach of confidentiality by an employee is subject to serious disciplinary action by the University, up to and including immediate termination of employment. The University may also be subject to monetary fines under the law. 
  14. The Student Health and Counseling Center follows all State of Colorado laws and federal HIPAA regulations governing the handling and release of medical and mental health information.
