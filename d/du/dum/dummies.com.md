John Wiley & Sons, Inc., and its related companies (collectively, "Wiley") recognize the importance of protecting the information collected from Users in the operation of this Web site, and take reasonable steps to maintain the security, integrity, and privacy of any information in accordance with this Privacy and Data Protection Policy. By submitting your information to Wiley, you consent to the practices described herein.

Wiley will ensure that any identifiable personal information it collects during the registration and purchasing processes will be adequate, relevant, and not excessive for purposes of operating this Web site or any of the services operated hereunder; it will be kept accurate and up-to-date based on information provided, and it will be deleted when no longer needed. Except where necessary in connection with services provided by appropriate intermediaries, who will be required to comply with the confidentiality provisions of this policy, Wiley will not disclose any personal information identifying Users to any third party, unless required by law or otherwise needed in connection with legal proceedings or unless we have received your consent.

If use of an electronic product, feature, or service offered by Wiley on this Web site requires a User to provide a name and password or other personally identifiable information, the User will have the option to opt in or out of providing such information and using the product, feature or service. Any private communications or information supplied to Wiley by a User may be used by Wiley for internal business and research purposes and to help enhance and develop our Web sites, but will not be shared with third parties unless we receive your consent.

Wiley may disclose to carefully chosen third parties navigational and transactional information in the form of anonymous, aggregate usage statistics (including "page views" on this Web site and the products herein) and demographics but only in forms that do not reveal a User's identity or confidential information, except as required by law, as needed in connection with legal proceedings, or unless we have received your consent.

In using such links, Users should be aware that each third party Web site will vary in terms of its privacy and data protection policies, and Wiley does not take responsibility for the privacy policies of, and usage of, personal information collected by others including, without limitation, those of any partner or affiliate.

You should be aware that identifiable personal information — such as your name or e-mail address — that you voluntarily disclose that are accessible to other Users (e.g., on bulletin boards or in chat areas) could be collected and disclosed by others. Wiley cannot take any responsibility for such collection and disclosure.
