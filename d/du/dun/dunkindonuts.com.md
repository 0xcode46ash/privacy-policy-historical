We want you to enjoy every visit to DunkinDonuts.com, whether you're here to order coffee, or to tell us about your last trip to one of our shops. So rest assured, any information you share with us, from your email address to your favorite donut, will be carefully guarded through our use of industry-standard security software to encrypt your credit card number and other ordering and shipping information. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

Dunkin' Donuts reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates.

What kind of information we ask for and why.  
If you request information from Dunkin' Donuts, or wish to share an experience you had at one of our stores, we'll ask for personal information such as your name, address, and email address, as well as store address and any other information you may wish to share, so that we can best respond to your comments.

If you place an order online, we'll ask for your name, email address, mailing address, credit card number, and expiration date. That's all the information we need to process, confirm, and ship your order.

If you choose to take part in a promotional event, we'll ask for any information necessary to the administration of the event such as your name, email address, and shipping address. We may, on occasion, co-sponsor promotions with third parties. We will notify you at the time of collection if third parties will obtain your personal information.

Information we gather from you is used to process your order and to make your visit productive and enjoyable. Unless we hear from you otherwise, we'll email you occasional updates about new additions to this site as well as special offers you can take advantage of here or at your local Dunkin' Donuts shop. If, at any time, you decide you'd rather not receive this type of information, just visit Your Account when that section of the site is available and let us know you've changed your mind.

We won't give any of your personal information to anyone outside of Dunkin' Donuts and our sister brands, Baskin-Robbins and Togo's, other than our agents who need to fulfill your order or respond to your requests or inquiries. We require our agents to respect our privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.

How we protect your credit card and other personal information  
When you input your credit card number and other personal information, we use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) to encrypt or scramble that information before it's sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it.
