We want you to enjoy every visit to DunkinDonuts.com, whether you’re there to look around, order coffee, join our loyalty program, or tell us about your last trip to one of our shops, as well as every experience with DD Online Services.  We do collect information about you and we may share that information with third parties in certain circumstances, so please read on for more details about how we use personal information we collect about you when you use the DD Online Services.

  
Dunkin’ Donuts controls and operates its business and the DD Online Services from within the United States of America.  Our online privacy practices are governed by the laws of the United States and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which may differ from privacy laws in your state or home country.  By submitting your personal information to us or our agents, through the use of the DD Online Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to any country and its use and disclosure in accordance with applicable U.S. Federal and State laws and with this Privacy Policy.  


  
We may change our Privacy Policy, so please check this page from time to time, as your continued use of the DD Online Services, after we publish our changes, indicates your acceptance of any changed terms.

In addition, when users request pages on the DD Online Services, our servers automatically log the IP address of the particular user.  The IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer in order to identify it whenever you are surfing the Web.

We may send you “transactional or relationship” communications to you, such as notices to facilitate a transaction you have conducted or messages that provide information about your existing account, using various electronic communication, including email and mobile communications.  You must opt-in to receive email and mobile communications (other than “transactional or relationship” communications referenced above), including SMS text messages from Dunkin' Donuts.  Any opt-in will be subject to this Privacy Policy and we'll only email you, send you mobile alerts or SMS text messages if you opt-in to receive them from us.  If, at any time, you decide you would rather not receive these types of communications from Dunkin' Donuts, you can opt-out by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any Dunkin' Donuts email or update the Contact Preferences for your Dunkin' Donuts account.

**3.      _How We May Disclose Personal Information We Collect_**  


Your privacy is very important to us.  We generally won’t disclose your Personal Information to anyone outside of Dunkin’ Donuts or our sister brand Baskin-Robbins, except in the following circumstances.  


  
**Service Providers**  


  
We may disclose your Personal Information to third-party service providers to provide us with services such as website hosting, professional services, including information technology services and related infrastructure, customer service, e-mail delivery, auditing and other similar services.

We may disclose personal Information to our affiliates (“Affiliates”) for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy, including for marketing purposes, and to be consistent with our goal of providing our consumers with the superior product and consumer experience that our customers have come to expect from us around the globe.  Affiliates are those companies that are under common control of our parent company Dunkin’ Brands, Inc.   


  
**To Perform Services You Request**  


  
We may disclose your Personal Information to third parties in order to perform services you request or functions you initiate, such as when you post information and materials on message boards and forums, including on our Facebook Page.   When you post information in a public forum it becomes public information.  In addition, we may disclose your Personal Information in order to identify you to anyone to whom you send communications through the DD Online Services, including through our gifting program.   


  
**Corporate Transactions or Events**  


  
We may disclose your information to a third party in connection with a corporate reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock, including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings.

**4.      _How We May Use And Disclose Other Information We Collect_**  


  
Similarly, we generally use Other Information for any purpose not prohibited by law.  In particular, we may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Other Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you.  The Other Information that we collect generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes.    


  
Where we combine Other Information with Personal Information in a way that can identify you or be used to identify you personally, we will treat that information as Personal Information, subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy.    


**5.      _How To Manage Your Account Information_**  


  
You can visit the account section of the DD Online Services website to manage and correct any factual inaccuracies in the information we have on file about you.   


**6.     _How We Protect Your Personal Information_**  


  
Dunkin’ Donuts has implemented reasonable safeguards designed to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of Personal Information provided or collected through our DD Online Services.    
With respect to payment card information and other Personal Information collected through our DD Online Services, we use Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL to encrypt or scramble that information during transmission.  


  
Unfortunately, no system or online transmission of data can be guaranteed to be 100% secure and you should always take appropriate security measures to protect your Personal Information, including ensuring that you have up-to-date antivirus software.  If you believe that your Dunkin’ Donuts account or any information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately through the Contact Us information provided below.    


**7.   _Our Policy on Cookies, Interest-Based Advertising and “Do Not Track”  _**  
** **  
What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files placed in your computer browser directories to store your information about your use of the DD Online Services and your activities online (collectively, “Cookies”).  A Cookie will typically contain the name of the domain (internet location) from which the Cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the Cookie (i.e. when does it expire), and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.  To find out more about Cookies, including how to see what Cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit **_[www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)_**.

How We Use Cookies

We use Cookies so that we can improve your online experience – for example, by remembering you when you come back to visit us, and making the content you see more relevant to you. Cookies also enable us to track online purchases made through the DD Online Services.

               
Your Control of Cookies

If you do not wish to receive Cookies or wish to manage when you accept Cookies in general, you may set your browser to reject Cookies or to alert you when a Cookie is placed on your computer.  Although you are not required to accept our Cookies, if you set your browser to reject Cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features and functionality of the DD Online Services.  The Help feature on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new Cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new Cookie, or how to disable Cookies altogether.  If you block or otherwise reject our Cookies, you may lose some of the functionality of our site.  For example, you may not be able to add items to your Shopping Cart, proceed to Checkout, or use any products and services that require you to sign in.

Online Advertising

The DD Online Services also use Cookies and other technologies such as pixel tags, web beacons and clear GIF files (collectively, “Data Collection Technologies”) to help manage our online advertising program. These Data Collection Technologies are provided by our ad management partners and other third parties.

                
In addition, we and our ad management partners may use these Data Collection Technologies to track the actions of users of the DD Online Services, to measure statistics of our marketing efforts, and to deliver advertisements on the DD Online Services that may be more relevant to individual consumers and that will improve the consumer experience on the DD Online Services.  For example, if you give us your zip code and we thus know you live in an area where a particular in-store promotion is going on (such as a new snack offering), we may deliver to you an advertisement that is specific to that promotion.

We support the Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising of the Digital Advertising Alliance (“Principles”).  This means that we allow you to exercise choice regarding the collection of information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites for online interest based advertising purposes.  More information about these Principles can be found at www.aboutads.info/. 

Opting Out of Interest-Based Advertisements

If you want to “opt out” of receiving online interest-based advertisements, please follow the instructions at [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices), or  <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/>.  An “opt-out” Cookie will be placed on your device indicating that you do not want to receive interest-based advertisements.  If you delete Cookies on your device generally, you will need to opt-out again. 

 Please note that when you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements, this does not mean you will no longer see advertisements from us or on the DD Online Services.  It means that the online ads that you do see will not be based on your particular interests. 

In addition, please note that certain third parties that we do not control may use Data Collection Technologies on the DD Online Services.  When you “opt-out” of receiving interest-based advertisements through one of the links above, these Data Collection Technologies may still collect information about your use of the DD Online Services, including for analytics and fraud prevention as well as any other purpose permitted under the Principles.  When we use the term “Data Collection Technologies” we are referring to any technology that collects information about your use of the DD Online Services and potentially about your activities when you leave the Services and visit other sites on the Internet.   


**8.      _Social Networking And Third Party Sites_**

  
When you link to the DD Online Services through any social networking or third party sites, applications or services, please remember that you are bound by the privacy policy of the social network or third-party site, application or service, and we do not control and are not responsible for the privacy practices of such sites. You should consult the privacy policy of such sites to determine the information practices of those sites.  


**9.      _Children’s Online Privacy_**  


  
Dunkin’ Donuts recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of children.  We will not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen (13).  When a user discloses personal information on the DD Online Services, the user is representing to us that he or she is at least thirteen (13) years of age.    


  
If a child under the age of thirteen (13) has provided us with personally identifiable information through the DD Online Services, we ask that a parent or guardian e-mail us at customerservice@dunkinbrands.com, and we will delete the child’s information from our records.

**10.    _  International_**  


  
This English-language Privacy Policy is Dunkin’ Donuts’ official statement of its  DD Online Services privacy practices.  In case of any inconsistency between this English-language Privacy Policy and its translation into another language, this English-language document prevails.

**11.      _Contact Us_**

If you have any questions regarding our privacy practices, you can email us at [customerservice@dunkinbrands.com](mailto:customerservice@dunkinbrands.com).
