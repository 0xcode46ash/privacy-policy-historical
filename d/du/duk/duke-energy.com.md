#### Security 

Given the nature of the internet and the fact that no security system is perfect, Duke Energy does not absolutely promise that the information you provide will never be obtained by unauthorized persons. Duke Energy does, however, utilize industry-standard practices to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration and destruction. Such measures include using firewalls and Secure Sockets Layers (SSL) to protect certain sensitive transmissions of information. In some areas of our web site, we require a user ID and password for you to access certain information. Duke Energy will not disclose such password to third parties; however, you are responsible for maintaining the privacy and security of your password.

#### Links To Non-Duke Energy Sites 

For the convenience of our users, some pages of our web site offer you the ability to link to and view pages of web site not operated or controlled by Duke Energy (such as weather and financial information). Often, but not always, you can tell that you have linked to a non-Duke Energy web site because the web site will open a separate browser window. Links by Duke Energy to such external web sites do not imply endorsement by Duke Energy of that company, its site or its privacy policy. Duke Energy and its affiliates do not monitor or control the content or the privacy policies of the external sites and are therefore not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of linked external web sites. When using a link to a non-Duke Energy web site, we recommend that you investigate the privacy practices and policies of such external site. 

#### Changes To Our Privacy Policy 

Duke Energy reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. If we decide to change our policy regarding privacy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy on our web site. You may want to visit this web site periodically to review the current Privacy Policy. Use of our web site after the posting of a revised privacy policy constitutes your agreement with the revised policy. This Privacy Policy is not intended to and does not create any contractual or legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
