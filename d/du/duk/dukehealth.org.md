Duke is committed to protecting your online privacy. In general, you can visit Duke Web sites without revealing any personal information. However, you may be asked to provide personal information to gain access to some of our content and services. This information helps us to better ascertain and address the health care needs and concerns of site visitors.

All personally identifiable data that you enter on this site is not sold or given to any third parties.
