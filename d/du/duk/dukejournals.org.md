    * ## Data Collection

We collect information that you voluntarily provide to us and information when you use the dukeupress.edu Web site. We collect this information in an effort to respond to your comment or question or to provide future communications to you that we think will interest you. We also collect information for market research purposes, including your customer type and notation of your primary relationship to the press. We store your purchase history in order to recommend future titles that may be of interest to you. With the exception of other university presses with whom we may share our mailing lists as described below, we do not share, trade, or sell your personally identifiable information collected through the Web site to anyone outside Duke University unless required by law or authorized by you.

    * ## Data Security

The Duke University Press Web site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption in the checkout process and where your personal data are required.

    * ## Opt-In/Opt-Out

You may opt-in to receive communications about subject areas in which Duke University Press publishes. You will have the opportunity to opt-in to receive these communications [via the sign-up form available on our website](https://app.e2ma.net/app2/audience/signup/1754029/21407/?v=a). If you opt to sign up to receive e-mail communications from us, you will receive e-mail. You may use the links at the bottom of any e-mail that you receive from us, or the sign-up form, to opt-out at any time, or to change your preferences. Submitting a query via any Contact form, Request Exam Copies form, Request Desk Copies form, Mailing List Rental inquiry or EDI/Pubnet inquiry form within content areas on our Web site will not automatically opt you in to receive e-mail communications from Duke University Press. Opting-in to receive communications from Duke University Press does not automatically opt you in to receive e-mail communications from Duke University proper or from other Duke University divisions.

Unless you instruct us otherwise when you submit an order, we will add your name, mailing address, and e-mail address (but not your telephone number) to our mailing lists. From time to time, you may receive e-mails and print catalogs from us that describe books in areas related to books you have purchased from us. From time to time, you may be mailed promotional materials from other university presses with whom we have shared our print mailing lists. If you do not want to receive mailings from us or from other publishers who use our print mailing lists, please let us know by writing to [orders@dukeupress.edu](mailto:orders@dukeupress.edu). 

    * ## Use of Cookies and IP Addresses

We do use cookies and do store cookies on your computer (a cookie is a small data file that Web sites often store on your computer''''s hard drive to help Web sites recognize you when you visit that site again). You will have to log in to the dukeupress.edu Web site each time you visit. We do record your IP (Internet Protocol) address and information regarding your brower type, ISP (Internet Service Provider), referring sites, entry and exit pages, and operating system flag on our server to help us analyze the traffic coming into our site.

    * ## Use of Reading Lists

The Duke University Press Web site features Reading Lists, which are groups of Duke University Press titles compiled by any dukeupress.edu registered member or invited Duke University Press special guest. Duke University Press may exclude any Reading List from posting to the dukeupress.edu Web site at its discretion. Reading List titles or tags containing profanity, violent or degrading themes, threats, or plagiarized material may be removed. A reading list may be marked "public" or "private" by the user who creates it. A Reading List marked "public" is viewable and searchable by all dukeupress.edu visitors. Duke University Press is not responsible for a Reading List intended for private viewing that is accidentally marked "public" by the user or if its status is changed to "public" due to technical error.

    * ## Use of External Sites

The Duke University Press Web site contains links to third-party Web sites. Duke University Press is not responsible for the content on third-party Web sites or for content originating outside Duke University Press.
