We respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request.

### Use of information

Personal information is used for three general purposes only: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfil your requests for products and services, and to contact you with news, for example, about specials and new products.

### Third party use

We do not sell, rent or loan our lists to third parties for e-mail marketing (exception: if the business which uses the information is sold by ICI, the data would be sold along with the business).
