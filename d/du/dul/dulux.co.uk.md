**Choice and consent.** To respect the purpose for which our site visitors gave us information. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request.

**Use of information.** To use personal information for three general purposes only: to customise the advertising and content you see, to fulfil your requests for products and services, and to contact you with news, for example, about specials and new products.

**Third party use.** To not sell, rent, or loan our lists to third parties for e-mail marketing (exception: if the business which uses the information is sold by ICI, the data would be sold along with the business). While we may sell advertising in our e-mail publications to other companies, we do not allow third parties any other use of our lists.

**Unsubscriptions.** To send our periodicals only to those who request them, and immediately unsubscribe those who request it. Sometimes people subscribe for their friends, and while we cannot prevent that, we do explain clearly how to unsubscribe. We keep our subscription lists as clean as possible to prevent obsolete e-mails from taking unnecessary bandwidth.

**Cookies*.** To use cookies in a responsible manner to help our visitors. We use cookies to identify you with your shopping list or other information you wish to save; and to remember your details so you do not have to give them twice.

**Security.** To store subscriber and password files with personal information in a secure manner. We store such files in areas not accessible to Web browsers, or behind password protection, or off-line.

If you have submitted personal information to ICI electronically and would like it removed, please contact us at intellectual_property@ici.com
