**MERCHANDISE AVAILABILITY**  
  
At the time of publication, merchandise in our catalog is scheduled to be in stock. However, sometimes we have exceptional demand for some items and must reorder. The high quality and exclusivity of some of our items sometimes demands additional manufacturing time and may lead to a slight delay. In this case, you will be advised of the expected delivery date. For best chance, we urge you to order early.
