  * Third party websites which may advertise on the Site and other third parties that you interact with through your use of the Service may also place or read cookies on your computer's browser, which enables them to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements and content.

  * Your Submissions. Any information you choose to provide in a comment or a submission on the Site or the Service will be publicly available and should reflect how much you want other users to know about you. **We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage you to think carefully about what information about yourself you disclose in your comments or submissions.** If you disclose your Personal Information to others, whether or not they are users of the Site, on our Site or through the Service or otherwise, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them
  * Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information.

Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.
  * Combined Information. We may combine certain Personal Information with non Personal Information in order to allow us to create information packages and services that are better tailored to your interests and preferences. Among other things, linking this information may allow us generally to improve and personalize the Site and the Service.
