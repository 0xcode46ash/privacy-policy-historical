Cookies cannot be used for running programs or delivering or transferring virus to your computer. A cookie is assigned unambiguously to you and can only be read by a web server on the domain that sent the cookie to you.  
One of the primary purposes of the cookies is to give you a convenient and time-saving function. If for example you are adapting a webpage or you are navigating on a website, a cookie will help the website recalling your specific data in connection with a subsequent visit. This facilitates the process by delivering the relevant contents and navigation is made easier.

This technology constitutes a tool that we use for compiling collected statistics on the use of DubLi Network.com's websites, for example how many visitors have clicked key elements (such as hyperlinks or graphical elements) on one of DubLi Network.com's webpages or blog pages or a newsletter. We can share the collected statistics from our website with partner companies.

Some of these web beacons may be placed by third-party service providers for purposes of measuring the efficiency of our advertisement campaigns or e-mail messages. These service providers can use web beacons for placing a continuing cookie on your computer. By doing this it is possible for the service provider to recognize your computer each time you visit certain pages or read specific e-mail messages, and to collect anonymous information in connection with showing these pages. DubLi Network does not permit web beacons to be used for collecting or obtaining access to your personal data.
