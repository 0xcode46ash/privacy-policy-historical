# Dubai eGovernment Security and Privacy Policies

Dubai eGovernment is committed to protecting the rights of all our visitors. We recognize our obligation to keep sensitive information secure and have created this security and privacy statement to share our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Website.

**Collection and Use of Online Information**

Our web server automatically collects your IP address when you visit our site. (Your IP address is your computer's unique address that lets other computers attached to the Internet know where to send data, but does not identify you individually.) We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to compile statistics on site usage. We do not make your IP address available to anyone outside Dubai eGovernment technology staff. To provide better service and a more effective Website, sections of this site may use "cookies" as part of our interaction with your browser. A cookie is a small text file (typically only a few bytes) that we place on your hard drive to allow our server to identify your computer. Our cookies will not attempt to read any information on your hard drive, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine your identity or your email address.

When you visit certain areas of this site, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information (such as name, address, gender and, potentially, credit card number) that we need to process your request. However, under any circumstance your credit card number will never be stored. In the event that you decline to provide such information, you limit our ability to serve you. Still, we invite you to continue to visit the site and take advantage of the wealth of information it offers.

**Secure Transmissions**

Please be assured that this site has security measures in place to protect the information you provide us. We encrypt information that is deemed sensitive (such as credit card numbers) or data that must remain secure to meet legal requirements.

**Protection of Personal Information**

Your personal information is available only to government employees who have a need to know it. It will not be available for public inspection without your consent. Also, no site user information will be shared, sold, or transferred to any third party without your prior consent. Access is given only to those qualified professionals who provide Dubai eGovernment services consistent with your interactions with our site.

**Right to Inspect, Amend, or Correct Personal Records**

Every site user who provides us with personal information has the right to inspect, amend, or correct his or her own personal information. You may ask to inspect your personal information by sending an email to help@dubai.ae.

**Other Sites** This privacy policy extends to Dubai eGovernment Portal only. If you link to another Website through the www.dubai.ae Website, you should read their privacy policy to determine their Website practices.
