We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our services. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them. You can find out how to do this, and find more information about cookies, at [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/) . 

We may also collect anonymous data (which is not personal information) relating to your activity on our websites (including IP Addresses) via cookies, or we may collect information from you in response to a survey. We generally use this information to report statistics, analyze trends, administer our services, diagnose problems and target and improve the quality of our services. To the extent this information does not constitute personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else, we may use this information for any purpose and by any means whatsoever. 

In addition to the express notice provided on our websites when you first visit, your continued use of our websites is your acceptance of our continued use of cookies on our websites.

If you suspect any misuse or loss of, or unauthorized access to, your personal information, please let us know immediately. 

**Compliance and cooperation with regulatory authorities**

We regularly review our compliance with our Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints, we will contact the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal information that we cannot resolve with our users directly. 

**Privacy Policy Changes**

In the future, we may revise or amend this Privacy Policy at any time by amending this page. All changes will be made here so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Some of the provisions contained in this Privacy Policy may also be superseded by provisions or notices published elsewhere on our websites.
