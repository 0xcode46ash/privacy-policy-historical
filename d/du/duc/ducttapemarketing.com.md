# Duct Tape Marketing Privacy Policy

Duct Tape Marketing is committed to protecting the privacy of visitors of our Web site. As such, your privacy is extremely important to us, and we will openly communicate and disclose our privacy practices to visitors of our site. We operate the site by the principles set forth below. The following Duct Tape Marketing privacy statement will outline:  
1\. What kind of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) we collect through our Web site;  
2\. How that information is collected and used;  
3\. With whom that information is shared, and who has access to that information;  
4\. Choices available to you regarding the collection, use and distribution of that information; and,  
5\. Security procedures in place to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of that information under our control.

**Information Collection and Use  
**  
Duct Tape Marketing is the sole owner of the information collected on this Web site. Our site collects non-personally identifiable information about you, such as the server your computer is logged onto and your browser type (for example, Firefox or Internet Explorer). This information will not be sold, shared with, or rented to other parties outside of Duct Tape Marketing, and is purged or automatically deleted when you close your Internet browser. Duct Tape Marketing does, however, collect "personally identifiable information", or PII (information that can be linked to you personally) about you through the optional enrollment in the Duct Tape Marketing newsletter.

**Cookies**  
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on a particular Web site. Cookies themselves do not personally identify a user, but they can identify a user's computer. Our site uses cookies to track a visitor's path through the Web site. The data collected from visitors to our site is analyzed in aggregate form to show trends and improve the Web site for future visits. The cookies we use do not record PII. Once you close your Internet browser, the cookie simply terminates. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. However, if you'd prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies, although our site may not perform at optimum levels without cookies.

**Text or Log Files**  
A Text or Log file is a file that describes which files or Web pages a site visitor has requested from our server(s). Like most public Web sites, our site collects non-PII data about you when you arrive at our site through text files and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you connect to the Internet; this number is not linked to any PII. The number is used by network computers to identify your computer so that data can be sent to you. Duct Tape Marketing collects IP addresses for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information about our visitors' browsing actions and patterns for aggregate use only.

**Sharing**  
Duct Tape Marketing will only disclose PII if required to do so by law. With that exception, under no circumstances will we share single user or aggregated demographic data with our partners without explicit consent of our users.

**Security**  
We have taken every precaution to ensure the protection of your information on our site. When you submit sensitive information to Duct Tape Marketing via our Web site, that information is protected both online and offline.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to any PII

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, please e-mail us at [ john@ducttapemarketing.com](mailto:john@ducttapemarketing.com)

**Notification of Changes:** If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page at [www.ducttapemarketing.com](http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/) so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will disclose it. If at any point we decide to use PII in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
