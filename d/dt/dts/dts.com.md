# Privacy Policy | DTS

Last Revised March 19, 2010 

DTS values the relationships we have built with our customers and is committed to protecting your privacy and the handling of any personal information we obtain from you. This DTS Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) details the type of personally identifiable information collected from users of DTS websites, including but not limited to www.dts.com, as well as the means by which we collect it, and our use and/or transfer of said information. This Privacy Policy applies to other websites which we run and which display a direct link to this Privacy Policy, but does not apply to websites that do not link to our Privacy Policy, to websites which have their own privacy policy or information collected by DTS by any other means. 

As used in this Privacy Policy, “DTS” refers to DTS, Inc., and its subsidiary and affiliated entities, individually or together and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as “DTS”, “we”, “us”, and “our”. We refer to individuals who access our website as “users” and when we use the term “personally identifiable information”, we are referring to information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual’s name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. Any other information that is directly associated with personally identifiable information, for example consumer product preferences, is also treated as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy. 

DTS is committed to handling all personal information subject to the EU data protection laws received from Member States of the European Union in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles published by the US Department of Commerce. Regardless where it originated, all user data subject to this Privacy Policy receives the same level of privacy protection as described herein. 

The terms of this Privacy Policy are subject to all applicable laws.

### Collection of Your Personal Information

Through our website, we collect different types of personally identifiable information from our users.

_Information You Provide to Us_

A majority of the personally identifiable information we receive comes directly from our users who are interested in obtaining information on technologies or services provided by DTS. Typically this data includes your name, email address(es), mailing address(es), telephone number(s), and in certain instances, business details. We may also collect information such as age, gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. 

_Information Collected Through Technology_

We also collect information through technology in order to enhance a users experience while on our website. We use technology that many other websites employ, including, “cookies” which are pieces of information that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the website, which can collect, and actually do collect anonymous traffic data, together with specific information such as your IP address, Internet service provider, and the date and time you access our websites. The information collected by the use of cookies and other technical methods does not, in general, allow us to personally identify a user of the DTS website. Although in theory the information collected by such methods could be utilized to identify individual users, DTS does not possess the expertise necessary nor the desire to use such information for this purpose. Cookies and other technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. Our website does not require the use of cookies and a user may disable this browser setting at anytime.

We do enlist the services of external companies to assist with the processing and delivery of mailings, the hosting of websites, the monitoring of social networks, and the processing of transactions. These service providers are only permitted access to the personally identifiable information required to perform a specific task and must maintain such data in strict confidence. We may retrieve and/or disclose personally identifiable information about a user; (1) if compelled by law, or (2) in response to a request from a law enforcement official in connection with a court proceeding, or (3) with a third party involved in an actual or prospective sale, merger, transfer or other reorganization of all or parts of our business.
