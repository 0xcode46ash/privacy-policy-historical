# Privacy Policy | DTS

Last Revised: January 3, 2014

DTS, Inc. ("DTS") respects your privacy. This DTS Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") informs you of our privacy practices and of the choices you can make regarding the information about you. This Privacy Statement applies to all DTS-owned websites, services, mobile applications and products, and those of our wholly owned subsidiaries ("Sites or Services"), except that a privacy policy or statement specific to a particular DTS program, product, or service may supersede or supplement this Privacy Statement.

DTS complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor framework and the US-Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. DTS has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.  To view DTS' certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>. If you wish to contact DTS about the Safe Harbor program, please send an e-mail to [safeharbor@dts.com](mailto:safeharbor@dts.com). If you wish to view our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, please visit <http://www.dts.com/safeharborpolicy.aspx>.

DTS has committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if DTS does not satisfactorily address your complaint, you may contact BBB EU Safe Harbor at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.dts.com/www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints).

Your use of our Sites or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use (<http://www.dts.com/terms-of-use.aspx>), except that residents of the European Union and Switzerland will be subject to dispute resolution in accordance with our Safe Harbor Privacy Policy.

**Collection of Your Personal Information**

_Information You Provide to Us_

We receive information from  users who are interested in obtaining information about our technologies or services, or users who purchase products from our Sites or Services. Typically, the information includes user name, user ID, user password, email address, mailing address, and telephone number. We may collect information such as age, gender, user preferences, and user activities on our Sites or Services. You do not have to provide your information to us, but if you do not provide your information, we may not be able to provide the Services to you (for example, we may not be able to process your online requests or transactions).

_Information Collected Automatically_

Through cookies, web beacons and other technologies, we may automatically collect information such as  your domain name, browser type and operating system, web pages and links you view, IP address, the length of time you visit our Sites, and the referring URL or the webpage that led you to our Sites.  We may collect information about your use of our mobile application, mobile device ID, location and language information, device name and model, operating system, your activities within the application, and the length of time that you are logged into our application.  Please see the section "What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?"  below for more information about our use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms. 

_Our Use of Browser Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms_

We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites or Services.  We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites or Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites or Services.  We use two types of browser cookies - session cookies and persistent cookies.

Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into our Sites.  This allows us to process your online transactions and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites. 

Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

We may also engage third parties to track and analyze information about your use of our Sites or Services.  We use the information collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of our Sites or Services.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.  This Privacy Statement does not cover third parties' use of the information. 

Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Users to our Sites or Services who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites or Services, but some features may not function.

Our Sites or Services, marketing partners, and third party websites linked to our Sites or Services, may use local shared  objects, also known as flash cookies ("Flash LSOs") to store your site preferences and to personalize your visit (such as setting the volume level last used to play a video).  Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.  Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser, but you may do so by visiting the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager at [http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/sett...](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html.%C2%A0) For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, please visit the [Adobe Flash Player Help Page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html), select "[Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)" and follow the instructions.  To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, select "[Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)" and follow the instructions to review and, if you wish, to delete any specific Flash LSO.

Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies and Flash LSOs, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of site users, manage content, and compile statistics about Sites usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

We use third party web analytics to evaluate usage of our Sites or Services.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Sites or Services.  We use these tools to help us improve our Sites or Services, or improve performance and user experiences.  The information collected through web analytics may be shared with third party analytics service providers. Our Sites or Services may contain links to third party websites.  If you provide any information to third party websites, other privacy policies may apply to the collection or use of your information on those sites. 

Third party websites linked to our Sites or Services, and marketing or advertising partners, may collect information about you and your computer network over time and across different websites to provide targeted or personalized advertising (also referred to as online behavioral advertising or interest-based advertising).  Some third party marketing partners comply with the protocols of the Networking Advertising Initiative (NAI) or Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA), which give users choices about how their personal information is tracked and used.  You can opt-out of receiving ads from third party advertisers and ad networks who subscribe to the NAI or DAA by visiting the opt-out pages at [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) (NAI homepage) and [www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/) (DAA homepage).  For more information about the privacy practices of third party advertisers, please visit their websites and review their policies or contact them directly.

_Information Provided Through Your Use of Social Media_

Our Sites or Services enhance user experience by providing ways to communicate with us and other users through various third party social media services, such as Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and YouTube.  By logging in to a third party social media service used to communicate on the Sites or Services, you give us permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable third party social media service to share with us in accordance with the privacy settings that apply to your account with the third-party social media services you use to communicate on the Sites or Services, and to combine that information with other information we have from or about you.
