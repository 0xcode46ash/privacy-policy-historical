# Privacy Policy | DTS

**DTS, INC.**   


Last Revised: January 3, 2013   


DTS values the relationships we have built with our customers and is committed to protecting your privacy and the handling of any personal information we obtain from you. This DTS Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") describes how we collect, use, and disclose personal and non-personally identifying information that we obtain about visitors to our websites, [www.dts.com](http://www.dts.com/), [www.phorus.com](http://www.phorus.com/), [http://store.phorus.com](http://store.phorus.com/) (the "Sites"), users of our mobile application ("Application") and other services (collectively, the "Services"), and our offline customers as well as the means by which we collect it, and our use and/or transfer of said information.   


As used in this Privacy Policy, "DTS" refers to DTS, Inc., and its subsidiary and affiliated entities, individually or together and is referred to in this Privacy Policy as "DTS", "we", "us", and "our". We refer to individuals who access our website as "users" and when we use the term "personally identifiable information", we are referring to information that identifies a particular individual, such as the individual's name, postal address, e-mail address and telephone number. Any other information that is directly associated with personally identifiable information, for example consumer product preferences, is also treated as personally identifiable information under this Privacy Policy.   


DTS complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. DTS has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.  For more information about the Safe Harbor and to view DTS' certification, please visit http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/. If you would like to contact DTS about the Safe Harbor program, please send an e-mail to [safeharbor@dts.com](mailto:safeharbor@dts.com).  


DTS has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by DTS, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints for more information and to file a complaint.  


By visiting the Sites, using or downloading the Application, or using any of our Services, you agree  that your personal information will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy.  Your use of our Sites or Services, and any dispute over privacy, is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, available at <http://www.dts.com/terms-of-use.aspx>, including its applicable limitations on damages and the resolution of disputes.  The DTS Terms of Use are incorporated by reference into this Privacy Policy.  


**Collection of Your Personal Information**  


Through our Sites, we collect different types of personally identifiable information from our users.  


_Information You Provide to Us_   


A majority of the personal information we receive comes directly from our users who are interested in obtaining information on technologies or services provided by DTS. Typically this data includes your name, email address(es), mailing address(es), telephone number(s), and in certain instances, business details. We may also collect information such as age, gender and personal interests, which we may associate with personally identifiable information. You do not have to provide your information to us, but if you do not provide certain information, we may not be able to provide the Services to you (for example, we may not be able to process your online requests or transactions).  


_Information Collected Automatically_   


We may automatically collect the following non-personally identifying information about your use of our Sites and Services through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies:  your domain name; your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your IP address; the length of time you visit our Site; and the referring URL, or the webpage that led you to our Sites.  We also may collect the following information about your use of the Application: mobile device ID; location and language information; device name and model; operating system type, name, and version; your activities within the Application; and the length of time that you are logged into our Application.  Please see the section "What About Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?"  below for more information about our use of cookies and other tracking mechanisms.    


We may use this information in aggregated form or we may associate it with your username and other personal information that we collect about you.    


Our Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms  


We use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our Sites.  We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.  Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Sites, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Sites.  There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies. 

  * _Session Cookies_.  Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you are logged into the Sites.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Sites. 

  * _Persistent cookies_. **  **Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.




_Third Party Cookies._ We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Sites data.  We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Sites and to analyze Site usage.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.  This Privacy Policy does not cover such third parties' use of the data.    


_Disabling Cookies_. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Sites, but some features may not function.   


**Local Storage Objects**.  We may use Flash Local Storage Objects ("Flash LSOs") to store your site preferences and to personalize your visit.  Flash LSOs are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored.  Typically, you cannot control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash LSOs through your web browser.  For more information on Flash LSOs, or to learn how to manage your settings for Flash LSOs, go to the [Adobe Flash Player Help Page](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html), choose "[Global Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html)" and follow the instructions.  To see the Flash LSOs currently on your computer, choose "[Website Storage Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)" and follow the instructions to review and, if you choose, to delete any specific Flash LSO.  


Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Sites to, among other things, track the activities of site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Sites usage.  We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.   


Third Party Analytics.  We use automated devices and applications,  third party analytics, to evaluate usage of our Sites and, to the extent permitted, our Application.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our Services.  We use these tools to help us improve our Services, performance and user experiences.    


**Use of Your Personal Information**  


We use the information that we gather about you for the following purposes: 

  * To provide our Services to you, to communicate with you about your use of our Services, and for other customer service purposes. 

  * To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to you, to offer location customization, and personalized help and instructions, and to otherwise personalize your experiences while using the Sites for our Services.

  * To better understand how users access and use our Sites and Services, both on an aggregated and individualized basis, in order to improve our Sites and Services and respond to user desires and preferences.

  * For marketing and promotional purposes.  For example, we may use your information, such as your email address, to send you news and newsletters, special offers, and promotions. We also may use the information that we learn about you to assist us in advertising our Services on third party websites. 




**Onward Transfer/Where We Store and Process Data**  


Personal information collected on the Sites may be stored and processed in the United States or other countries in which DTS or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities.   


**Sharing of Your Personal Information**  


Except as detailed in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose your personal information outside of DTS and its subsidiaries and affiliated entities without your prior consent.  We may share the information that we collect about you, including personal information as follows: 

  * Affiliates.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to our affiliates or subsidiaries; however, if we do so, their use and disclosure of your personal information will be subject to this Privacy Policy.  

  * Service Providers.  We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.

  * Business Transfers.  If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company. 

  * In Response to Legal Process.  We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.    

  * To Protect DTS and Others.  We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Privacy Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which DTS is involved. 

  * Aggregate and De-Identified Information.  We may share aggregate or de-identified  information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.

We review these security measures from time to time and evaluate new technologies or approaches that would further enhance the security measures currently in place. Please be informed that despite our best efforts, no security measures are impenetrable. We ask that you safeguard any password or User ID obtained for use on our website as these are personal to each user and link to personally identifiable information. Each user takes full responsibility for any misuse or unauthorized use of our website via your password and User ID.   


You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private.  We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity.
