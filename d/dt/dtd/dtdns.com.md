# DtDNS :: Privacy Statement

Privacy Statement

The following privacy statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site.

**Effective Date: April 12, 2002**

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. IP addresses associated with hostnames and domains are also used in the DNS protocol, and will be publicly available to the Internet community. Since this is an IP redirection service, IP addresses may also be used in statistical tracking.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, or income level). The customer's contact information is used primarily to contact the visitor when necessary. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. A member's name and e-mail address may be available in the system's WHOIS records, as it would be as if they had registered a full domain name. A member may opt to conseal their e-mail address from being displayed in WHOIS lookups.

DtDNS does not sell mailing lists or otherwise share membership data with anyone (except as noted above) unless required by law.

This site contains links to other sites. DtDNS is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

We also offer an option in the Account Profile to toggle the option to receive notices.
