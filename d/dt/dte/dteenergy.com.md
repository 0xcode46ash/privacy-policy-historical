Last Modified: November 5, 2002

DTE Energy and its [affiliates](http://www.dteenergy.com/company/dteFamily.html) understand your concerns about the use of your personal information online and are committed to protecting your privacy. We have adopted the following online Privacy Policy to give you a better understanding of how we handle your information.

**What type of information do we gather about you?**  
Unless you supply us with contact information, we collect only the domain name, not the e-mail address of visitors to our Web site. If you supply us with any contact information such as your e-mail address, postal address, or telephone number, we will only contact you regarding the matter for which you provided contact information to us. Be assured that your contact information will not be shared with any other organization for commercial purposes.

**What is our policy regarding cookies?**  
DTE Energy only sets cookies in order to provide automated services on [ https://my.dteenergy.com](https://my.dteenergy.com/). We do collect the browser type and version and IP (Internet provider) address of visitors. We also gather aggregate information on what pages you access in our Web site. The information we collect is used only for internal review to improve the content of our Web site.   
**  
How do we ensure the secure transfer of your information?**  
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring consumer data. When we transfer certain types of sensitive information such as financial, personal, account, or service information, we redirect visitors to a secure server where all communication between your computer and ours is scrambled into hard to decipher code and then translated back to meaningful communication. But regardless of the precautions, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of the information you transmit to us. The information you transmit to us is done at your own risk.

**Do we provide links to other sites?**  
To enrich the content of our Web site we provide links to other sites operated independently from DTE Energy. Please be advised that other sites may collect personal information from their visitors. We recommend you check their privacy policies.

**What happens if we make changes to our Privacy Policy?**  
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy. If our information practices do change, we will notify you by posting the changes to our Web site. We will provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses, if applicable. If you are concerned about how your information will be used, please check our Web site periodically. In the event we do change our policy, you may prevent your information from being used for purposes other than for which you provided it by sending us e-mail at [webmaster@dteenergy.com.](mailto:webmaster@dteenergy.com)

**How do I correct an inaccuracy in the information I provide?**  
Upon request we offer visitors the ability to correct any information provided to us. You can correct information provided to us by sending us e-mail at [ correspondence@dteenergy.com](mailto:correspondence@dteenergy.com)
