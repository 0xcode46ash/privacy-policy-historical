We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring personally identifiable information.

But regardless of the precautions, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personally identifiable or other information you transmit to us. The information you transmit to us is done at your own risk.
