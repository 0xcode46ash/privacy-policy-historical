**What type of information does DTE Energy gather?**  
For research purposes, we routinely collect the domain name, but not the e-mail address, of visitors to our Web sites (see our policy regarding cookies). The only personally identifiable information we gather is that information which you provide to us. If you supply us with any personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, postal address, telephone number or if you provide information via our job application process, we will only contact you regarding the matter for which you provided personally identifiable information to us. Be assured that your contact information will not knowingly be shared with any other organization for commercial purposes.

**What is the Company's policy regarding cookies?**  
DTE Energy may set cookies in order to provide automated services or surveys on its Web sites. We do collect the browser type and version and IP (Internet provider) address of visitors. We also gather aggregate information on what pages you access in our Web sites. The information we collect is used only for internal review to improve the content of our Web sites.

**How does the Company ensure the secure transfer of my information?**  
We use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring personally identifiable information. When we transfer certain types of sensitive information such as financial, personal, account, or service information, we redirect visitors to a secure server where all communication between your computer and ours is scrambled into hard to decipher code and then translated back to meaningful communication. But regardless of the precautions, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personally identifiable or other information you transmit to us. The information you transmit to us is done at your own risk.

**What is DTE Energy's policy regarding e-mail?**  
We do not send unsolicited e-mail. Registered users of my.dteenergy.com, or of other DTE Energy affiliates' Web sites, may 'opt-in' to receive e-mail from us. We do not ask for your personal or account information in an e-mail unless you have contacted us first and we need to clarify your request. If you have any doubt an e-mail is really from us, go to our Web site directly by typing dteenergy.com into your browser window and navigating to the desired page. For more tips on Web security, please see our [Help file](http://my.dteenergy.com/myAccount/manageAccountHelp.do#security) on Security and Privacy. We encourage you to report suspicious e-mail by forwarding the message to spoof@dteenergy.com.
