# Privacy Policy - My Healthy Love

**_Private_**

We value your trust, and we respect your privacy. We want your experience with MyHealthyLove.com and the internet to be enjoyable, safe, and secured. 

**_Safe_**

Shop and order with confidence.  Your private financial and personal information is secured using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology with 128 bit encryption. All information processed for an order is transmitted via an encrypted secure server.  This feature 'scrambles' your credit card and personal information during the brief seconds that it takes to transmit it from your web browser to our servers.  When it arrives at our server it is 'unscrambled' and processed. This method of transferring customer and financial information is one of the safest method of transmission on the Internet. 

**_Secured_**

For your security and ours, your credit card information is never stored on our server.  Credit card information is deleted immediately after completing a transaction. 

**_Personal Touch_**

All books can be autographed by Dr. Grace at your request.  Please write your request in the "special instruction" box when ordering.  CDs and personally-autographed books are non-returnable and non-refundable.  Please contact us within 48 hours of receipt.  Un-autographed books, in purchased condition, are returnable within seven days after you've received them. 

**_Protected_**

We do not rent, reuse, sell, or share your email or contact information with outside parties.  We only use your email address to communicate with you, in order to confirm your order, or to notify you of special offers or programs you might find of interest.  We believe in protecting a child's privacy; therefore, MyHealthyLove.com does not knowingly sell products, or collect personal information from children under the age of 18. 

Please allow the standard five to seven days for your delivery.  Special rush delivery service is available upon request for an additional cost.
