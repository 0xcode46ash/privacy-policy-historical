**Personally Identifiable Information**

You may visit **Dr. Leonard's** web site anonymously. However, we offer special features that require you to submit personal information to participate. For example, if you make a purchase using a credit card, we will need to collect information such as your credit card number and billing address to complete that transaction.

We may use your personal information to send you information about goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you. At our discretion, we may share your personal information with third parties who may also contact you. Please note that we advise our partners to use your information in accordance with this policy.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

_Cookies_

To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature found in browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of anonymous user ID that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read data off your hard drive. 

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. We may share this data with third parties to achieve those goals. In. addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of some of **DrLeonards.com** 's features (e.g. personalization and storage of shopping bag items), and we recommend that you leave then turned on. 

**Children's Information**

We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. The **Dr. Leonard's** web site is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 18. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is under the age of 18. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting revisions to this web site. Your continued use of this web site after any changes have been posted indicates your agreement to the revised terms. Accordingly, we urge you to review this privacy policy at the start of each use of this web site. We will also list the date of the last revision at the top of the privacy policy. 

**Confidentiality and Security**

We use modern technology to protect the information you submit. All personally identifiable user information is stored on secured servers and behind a firewall. However, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee the absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. 

**Contact Information**

You may review or delete any personal information we retain about you by sending an email to our Privacy Officer at the address listed below. However, if you are contacted by one of our partners, you will need to alert them that you wish your information to be deleted.

If you have any questions about our privacy policy, you can contact **Dr. Leonard's** customer service. [Click Here](mailto:%50%72%69%76%61%63%79%4F%66%66%69%63%65%72%2E%44%52%4C%2E%43%57%47%40%64%72%6C%65%6F%6E%61%72%64%73%2E%63%6F%6D) to send any questions you may have.
