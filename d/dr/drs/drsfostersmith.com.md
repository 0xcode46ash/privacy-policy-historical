Secure Shopping  


[](https://www.scanalert.com/RatingVerify?ref=www.drsfostersmith.com)

All orders on our site are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology - one of the most prevalent and secure systems available online. SSL is an extremely complex form of cryptography that makes it virtually impossible for a third party to decrypt any personal information you provide. You can rest assured that your personal and credit card information is protected when transmitted online. You can find detailed information about SSL technology and how it works online using any of the search engines. A good place to start is by visiting [Webopedia's discussion on SSL](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/S/SSL.html).
