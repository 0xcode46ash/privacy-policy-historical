# Privacy Policy - DrugWatch.com

## Information Collection and Use

Drugwatch.com receives, but does not track, a variety of “personally identifiable information,” including your email address, IP address and and message content. When we need to collect personally identifiable information from you to execute a requested transaction or provide you with a particular service, we will ask you to voluntarily supply us with the information we need. We may ask you for information such as, but not limited to: your name, address, telephone number, and email address to process your submission. You also have the option of also providing information regarding your name, demographics (such as your state and country of residency), operating system, browser, Internet service provider (“ISP”), connection type and email program that you are using. Drugwatch.com also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP Address and the page you requested. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or Drugwatch.com.

Drugwatch.com does not collect your email address unless you actively provide it to the company so that we communicate with you.

When your Web browser or email application requests a Web page from another computer on the Internet it automatically gives that computer the address where the requested information should be sent. This is called your computer’s “IP address.” (IP stands for “Internet protocol.”) For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up ISP, the IP address may be different every time you log on. Drugwatch.com receives your IP address each time you view a Web page from the Site. Your IP address is not linked to your email address or any other personally identifiable information.

#### Your IP address may be used for various purposes, including:

  * To diagnose service or technology problems reported by you that are associated with your IP address

The server collects information about which pages on the site are accessed and the duration of a visitor’s time on the page. Drugwatch.com is able to see how a visitor accessed the site, whether it is through a search engine or a specific advertising banner.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, in accordance with applicable state and federal standards, to protect your personal financial information against risks such as loss, destruction or misuse.
