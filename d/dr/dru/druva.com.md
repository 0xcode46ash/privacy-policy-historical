### Changes to This Policy

We may change this Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any changes to this Policy, we will change the “last updated” date above. If we make any material changes we will notify you by email, sent to the e-mail address specified in your account, or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you use our Site and services to understand how your personal information is used.

### Information Collected

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Site and services. We may also supplement this information with information such as “title” or “industry” from other companies to ensure a complete user profile is created. We collect two general types of information, namely, personal information and aggregate data. As used in this Policy, the term “personal information” means information that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name and email address), and demographic and other information when directly linked to information that can identify an individual. Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate” data. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no personal information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our customer needs, improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes. We collect information you give us on our Site and when you register for and use our services. Examples include the following:

  * Registration and profile information — when you register to use our services or update your profile, we may collect various kinds of information about you, including your name and email address; your title, company and other profile information you provide; demographic information; and information you upload like photos, files, and documents.
  * Contact information — we collect the email addresses you provide for contacts you enter or upload into your private contacts page. When you choose to collaborate or share files with others, we also collect email addresses you provide to email invitations to those individuals on your behalf.
  * Payment information — if you choose to use a paid Druva account or service, our payment processing vendor collects your credit card information and billing address.
  * Submissions and customer service — from time to time we may use surveys, contests, or sweepstakes requesting personal or demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information.
  * Automatically collected information — we automatically receive certain types of information when you interact with our Web pages, services, and communications. For example, it is standard for your Web browser to automatically send information to every Site you visit, including ours. That information includes your computer’s IP address, access times, your browser type and language, and referring Site addresses. We may also collect information about the type of operating system you use, your account activity, and files and pages accessed or used by you. We do not link this automatically-collected information to personal information.
  * When you download and use our services — we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or “UDID”). We also access the device file storage for photos and contacts. You can opt out of this at the device level. 
  * We do not ask for, access or track any location-based information from your mobile device at any time, unless the Data Loss Prevention (DLP) add-on is activated when using our Mobile Apps or Services. A user must explicitly turn on the location information feature but may or may not be able to disable this feature depending on their organization policy.
  * Mobile Analytics – We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone. This software may record information such as how often you use the application, the events that occur within the application, aggregated usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. We do not link the information we store within the analytics software to any personally identifiable information you submit within the mobile application.
  * Tracking technologies — we and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, may also use certain kinds of technology such as cookies, Web beacons, scripts, and tags to collect information, analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies from these companies on an individual or aggregated basis.
  * Among other things, the use of cookies and Web beacons enables us to improve our Site and emails by seeing which areas and features are most popular, to count the number of computers accessing our Site, to personalize and improve your experience, to record your preferences, and to allow you to visit our Site without re-entering your member ID and/or password. A cookie is a small amount of data, which is sent to your browser from a Site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive. Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You can modify your browser setting by editing your browser options to reject our cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie. However, if a browser is set not to accept cookies or if a user rejects a cookie, some portions of the Site and services may not function properly. For example, you may not be able to sign in and access certain Web page features or services. A Web beacon is an electronic image, also called a “gif,” that may be used on our Web pages to deliver cookies, count visits, compile statistics on usage, and campaign effectiveness in our emails to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. None of these cookies and web beacons is tied up to your personal information.
  * Local Storage (HTML5) – We and our third party partners use Local Storage (HTML5) to provide certain features on our Site, to display advertising based on your Web browsing activities, and/or to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.
  * We partner with a third party to display advertising on our Site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this Site and other sites to provide you advertising based on your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt out by clicking here. If you are located in the European Union, click here. Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads; you will continue to receive generic ads.

### Network and Information Security

Druva takes reasonable steps to protect information we collect from you and our platform to prevent loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction.

The servers on which information is stored are kept in a controlled environment with limited access.
