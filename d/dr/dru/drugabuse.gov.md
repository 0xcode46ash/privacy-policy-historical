#### Information Collected and Stored Automatically:

When you browse through any web site, certain personal information about you can be collected. We automatically collect and temporarily store the following information about your visit: 

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain), and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site, 
  * The date and time you access our site, 
  * The pages you visit, and 
  * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website. 



We use this information for statistical purposes and to help us make our site more useful to visitors. Unless it is specifically stated otherwise, no additional information will be collected about you. 

#### Personally Provided Information:

You do not have to give us personal information to visit our web sites.

If you choose to provide us with additional information about yourself through an e-mail message, form, survey, etc., we will only maintain the information as long as needed to respond to your question or to fulfill the stated purpose of the communication.

However, all communications addressed to information@nida.nih.gov or the Webmaster are maintained, as required by law, for historical purposes. These communications are archived on a monthly basis, but are also protected by the Privacy Act which restricts our use of them, yet permits certain disclosures. 

#### Disclosure:

NIDA does not disclose, give, sell or transfer any personal information about our visitors, unless required for law enforcement or statute. 

#### Intrusion Detection:

This site is maintained by the U.S. Government. It is protected by various provisions of Title 18, U.S. Code. Violations of Title 18 are subject to criminal prosecution in federal court.

For site security purposes and to ensure that this service remains available to all users, we employ software programs to monitor traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. In the event of authorized law enforcement investigations, and pursuant to any required legal process, information from these sources may be used to help identify an individual. 

#### Systems of Records:

Information originally collected in traditional paper systems can be submitted electronically, i.e., electronic commerce transactions and information updates about eligibility benefits. Electronically submitted information is maintained and destroyed pursuant to the Federal Records Act, and in some cases may be subject to the Privacy Act. If information that you submit is to be used in a Privacy Act system of records, there will be a Privacy Act Notice provided. 

#### Security:

Information collected online in the form of server logs, form submissions or e-mail to information@nida.nih.gov are stored securely and have limited access by NIDA staff. Archival data is stored offline in a secured storage facility.

#### Cookies:

A "cookie" is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk allowing our server to "remember" specific information about your session while you are connected. 

The NIDA site is running a customer satisfaction survey that employs persistent cookies. Participation in this data collection effort is completely voluntary, and failure to respond will in no way affect the visitor's ability to access information. This information will be used by NIH solely for the purpose of improving our public Web sites.
