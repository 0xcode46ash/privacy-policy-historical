# About us- Legal- Partnership for a Drug-Free America<br>Privacy Policy

The Partnership For A Drug-Free America (PDFA) is committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Below is our privacy assurance and some additional information about how we gather information about our registered users, why we gather it, and what we do with it. Please see Terms and Conditions of Use for more information about the use of the PDFA site. 

**_Privacy Assurance_**  
**We will not willfully disclose any individually identifiable information about you to any outside source without your express consent.**

**_Why do we ask for personal information about you?_**  
We require simple registration so that we can learn more about our audience. This helps us provide you with a comprehensive set of actionable news, information, and tools to assist you in learning, understanding and dealing with the issues surrounding substance abuse. In addition, we require registration for several interactive features. In order to use these features, we ask you to complete a simple registration form. These features provide you with the opportunity to connect with other visitors through message boards and enable you to share personal stories and experiences that offer helpful insights about substance abuse issues. 

**_Registration_**  
Our Message Boards, In Your Own Words, Expert Advice, and Memorial sections require you to register in order to submit stories, experiences and postings. Registration is not required, however, to browse through these sections. Our site's registration system requires you to provide us with basic contact information such as name and e-mail address, and demographic information such as a ZIP code, sex, age, and if appropriate, children's age(s). 

**_How does PDFA use cookies?_**  
PDFA uses cookies to facilitate the login process for you in the Message Boards, In Your Own Words, Expert Advice, and Memorial sections. When you register with PDFA, we assign a unique user id to you, and we place a cookie on your computer, which will remind our system of that user id in other areas of the site, or next time you visit the site. This cookie allows you to access all of the areas of the site that require registration without having to log on multiple times. If you choose to log out, this cookie we set in registration will be deleted and we will then set another cookie like it on your computer next time you log in. 

_Please note:_ Nothing in a cookie allows anyone to identify you individually. Your computer is assigned a number and that number is tracked using the cookie. This number is only meaningful in the context of our secure database system and your personalized version of PDFA. 

We also use cookies to log your activity on the site. Everything we learn from these logs will be used to enrich your experience on our site. It will help us understand what you like and don't like, so we can focus our energies more effectively and provide you with improved information, tools, and features. 

**_What information do we gather?_**  
The only individually identifiable information that we collect about you is that which you provide to us in registration or through polls and surveys that you choose to fill out. As stated earlier, this information will be closely protected and used for internal purposes only. We will never willfully release your personal information to any third party. 

We also collect information about aggregate site usage. Statistics that we gather about unique visits, repeat visits and page views are all based on IP address, not on your individual activities. 

**_eNewsletter Sign-up_**  
Our eNewsletter Sign-up section requires you to enter your email address to sign up for email newsletters. When you choose to sign up for one of our email newsletters, your email address is used solely to provide the newsletter to which you subscribe. Your email address won't be shared with any outside organizations or individuals without your express permission. Whenever you do receive a mailing from us you will always find an easy method to unsubscribe within the contents of the email. 

**_Expert Advice_**  
For the Expert Advice section, we require you to Register so that we can contact you, if necessary, with regard to the question submitted. Not all questions will be answered on the site. We may also choose to answer your question on a one-to-one basis, depending on the nature of the question. 

**_In-Your-Own-Words_**   
Many visitors to our site have stories to share about their experiences, or experiences of their friends and siblings, with substance abuse, recovery, treatment, prevention, etc. We created the In-Your-Own-Words section to enable you to submit a personal story for possible posting to our site. Only select stories will be posted to the site. Any stories selected for publication will be published anonymously, and any names mentioned in the postings will be changed. When you submit a story to this section, an email address is required in case we need to contact you. By submitting a story, you automatically give us permission to post the story on our web site. PDFA reserves the right to edit the story for publication. Your email address will not be published, and your email address and story will not be shared with any outside organizations or individuals. Please review our Terms and Conditions of Use for more information. 

**_Memorials_**  
We created a Memorials section for individuals to submit memorials to loved ones. We review all submittals and secure written permission before we post any memorials. Memorials published on the site will contain the real names of the deceased and possibly images submitted by the contributor. 

**_Changes to Privacy Policy._**  
PDFA may at any time revise this Privacy Policy by updating this posting. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the then current Privacy Policy to which you are bound.
