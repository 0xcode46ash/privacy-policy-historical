 **Information We Collect**  
We recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our site to provide you with a superior shopping experience. **Your Personal Information**  
When you place an order, we will ask you to set up "your account," which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, as well as certain other information when you order prescriptions. If you would like to review or revise the information we have in your account, you may access such information by clicking on the "your account" tab on any screen. **Your Prescription Information**  
To fill your prescription drug order, we collect the following additional information: your date of birth, gender, drug allergies, medical conditions, illnesses, and current medications. If you plan to use insurance and you can't find the member or group number, we ask that you provide your Social Security Number. Your Social Security Number is only used for purposes of seeking reimbursement from insurance companies. 

We protect all of your information against unauthorized access or release. We share your personal and prescription information with third parties if legally necessary to do so and as follows:

  *  **Amazon.com** \- When you have an account with Amazon.com and have entered our site from the Amazon.com site, we send to Amazon.com the server log information about your visit to our store, including non-pharmacy pages viewed and non-pharmacy products purchased. Neither your account information nor your prescription information will be shared. Any information shared under this relationship will be treated in accordance with each company's privacy policy. 

If you do not wish for your server log information to be shared with Amazon, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/thanks.asp?action=amznoptout&atrx=dps-6&atrxp1=15729&atrxp2=3&atrxp3=%2Fthanks%2Easp%3Faction%3Damznoptout&atrxp4=15729).

  *  **GNC** \- Because we sell and accept GNC Gold Cards on behalf of GNC , when you purchase a GNC Gold Card from drugstore.com, we share your name, address, phone number, gender, and birth month and year with GNC. At your direction, we also share your e-mail address. When you use your GNC Gold Card to purchase GNC products at drugstore.com, we share with GNC a list of the products you purchased in the GNC Live Well store. We do not share with GNC information about products that you purchase outside of the GNC Live Well Store. 
  * **Rite Aid** **-** drugstore.com serves as the on-line pharmacy for Rite Aid Corporation, a chain pharmacy with approximately 3,800 store locations throughout the United States. We entered into the relationship to serve as the online pharmacy for Rite Aid because we believe that the relationship allows us to provide better services to our customers. If you are filling an original prescription through drugstore.com for the first time, the prescription will be mailed to you. Because of our relationship with Rite Aid, when you place your Rite Aid or drugstore.com refill prescription order at drugstore.com, you may choose to have the prescription mailed to you or available for pickup at the Rite Aid store convenient to you. From time to time it may be more efficient for drugstore.com to fill a prescription ordered on its Web site through Rite Aid's central pharmacy (e.g., to meet short-term shortages of drug product availability, or to allow insurance coverage). If you have chosen to pick up your prescription at a Rite Aid store or your prescription is being filled through Rite Aid's central pharmacy, drugstore.com and Rite Aid will share patient information necessary to allow each to meet its obligations in dispensing medications and related information. This exchange is solely for purposes of professional pharmacy practice and administration. Rite Aid is bound by the same confidentiality standards as drugstore.com, and will not release patient information to others. 
  * **Brand Manufacturers** \- We may develop programs with some of our brand manufacturers whereby you may be offered special discounts or coupons on products in exchange for providing your e-mail address or completing a survey about the manufacturer's products. When you are offered such discounts or coupons in exchange for your e-mail address or completing a survey, you will be notified that if you complete the survey, your name, e-mail address and responses will be shared with the brand manufacturer. No other information will be shared. 
  * **Agents** \- We may enter into an agreement with other companies or individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions may include sending promotional e-mails on our behalf to such companies' customers; analyzing data; providing marketing assistance; processing credit card payments; and fulfilling and delivering orders. These companies and individuals will have access to information necessary to perform their functions. They will not be allowed to use the information for any other purpose and will be bound to the terms of our privacy policy. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties.
  *  **Business Transfers** \- We may buy or sell stores or assets. In such transactions, customer information is usually treated as one of the transferred business assets. Should drugstore.com, inc., or Beauty.com, inc., or substantially all of either of their assets be sold, customer information will be one of the transferred business assets.
  *  **As You Direct** : - If the patient has directed, we will release prescription information to the patient's authorized representative, or the prescribing or other authorized practitioner caring for the patient. At the direction of the patient and to the extent specifically authorized by law, we will release such information to other persons, including Rite Aid (see above for details) and insurance plans. For example, at your request drugstore.com will automatically forward your prescription information to your insurance plan so that drugstore.com can directly handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase on your behalf.

From time to time, we may partner with certain companies who, in conjunction with their membership programs or rewards programs, require that we disclose purchasing information about their members who visit the drugstore.com and beauty.com Web stores (for example, to earn points for purchases made on our site through links from the partner site). We will disclose only the information required to make these programs work for you and support your membership in them. In addition, we only disclose this information to such companies if you have consented first, including consent implied by your agreement to the membership or participation rules. If you do not want us to disclose that information to the strategic partner, then you must contact them directly.


Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information. **Security**  
When you place an order online or use the pharmacy, your personal information and credit card information are encrypted using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet, making it virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred to drugstore.com or Beauty.com. Your credit card information is always stored in encrypted form in a database that is away from our Web site database so it isn't connected to the Internet, and is therefore safe from hackers. **Cookies**  
To personalize your experience at both drugstore.com and Beauty.com, we use a feature on your Internet browser called a cookie. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to let us know that you are a prior customer and to retrieve certain information previously provided by you to us, so that you do not need to re-enter this information every time you shop at the site. Cookies also let us know how you found us (e.g., through a particular web site or advertisement). Cookies are not used to access information entered on the secure server. This information can only be accessed when you enter your name and password. If you choose to configure your browser to remove or reject drugstore.com or Beauty.com cookies, you will not be able to make purchases from the drugstore.com or Beauty.com sites. **Web Beacons**  
In addition, from time to time we contract with third party companies to help us better provide relevant products and services to you. Some of these companies use Web beacons. A Web beacon is a transparent image that has been placed on a Web page and sends a signal when a user has visited that page. A Web beacon does not contain any personal information. No Web beacons are currently being used at drugstore.com or Beauty.com. We will revise our privacy policy to identify the third party companies that are using Web beacons on our behalf during the time when such a relationship is active. **Your Consent**  
By using our Web site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of information by drugstore.com and Beauty.com and to the terms of this privacy policy. If we ever change our privacy policy, we will post any changes on this page so that you are always aware of the information that we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If we were to make a material change to our privacy policy, we will either post a notice on our Web site or send you an e-mail. **Your Comments**  
We welcome your feedback. If you have questions or comments about our privacy policies, feel free to drop us an e-mail at [customercare@drugstore.com](mailto:customercare@drugstore.com).
