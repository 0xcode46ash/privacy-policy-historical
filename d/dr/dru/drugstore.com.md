**Your Personal Information**

We at drugstore.com recognize your right to confidentiality and are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information that we collect on our site to provide you with a superior shopping experience. When you order, we will ask you to set up "your account," which includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date, as well as certain other information when you order prescriptions. In addition, we ask that you indicate whether you would like to receive e-mail from drugstore.com keeping you informed of new products or features. If you would like to review or revise the information we have in your account, you may access such information by clicking on the "your account" tab on any screen. We protect your account information against unauthorized access or release. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party, unless legally required to do so. We may share non-personal, summary, or aggregate customer data with partners and other third parties. 

**Your Prescription**

To fill your prescription drug order, we collect the following additional information: your date of birth, gender, drug allergies, medical conditions, illnesses, and current medications. If you plan to use insurance and you can't find the member or group number, we ask that you provide your Social Security Number. Your Social Security Number is only used for purposes of seeking reimbursement from insurance companies. We have contracted with RxAmerica, our prescription fulfillment partner, who dispenses your prescription in Ft. Worth, Texas and works with our pharmacists to ensure accurate and confidential fulfillment of your prescriptions. We will not release any prescription information in connection with any patient identification other than to the patient, our fulfillment partners, the patient's authorized representative, or the prescribing or authorized practitioner caring for the patient. At the direction of the patient, to the extent specifically authorized by law, we will release such information to other persons. For example, you may request that drugstore.com automatically forward your prescription information to your insurance plan so that drugstore.com can directly handle reimbursement of your prescription purchase on your behalf.
