# PATHFINDER PRIVACY POLICY

**Pathfinder Privacy Policy**

The Pathfinder web sites are maintained by Time Inc. New Media, 1271 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY, 10020. 

These sites collect no personally identifying information about individuals except when specifically and knowingly provided by such individuals. An adult user's personally identifying information will not be transferred to any other party unless otherwise stated at the time of collection. A user's personally identifying information may be used by Time Inc. New Media for editorial purposes. TINM may also use such information provided by adult users for promotional and marketing purposes. Individuals have the ability to stop their information being used for marketing and promotional purposes by sending an e-mail request to Time Inc. New Media at the address given at the end of this Policy. Any personally identifying information collected by Pathfinder from children is used for editorial participation and feedback purposes, together with any other purposes that will be described where the information is collected, and will not be transferred to any third party. Many of the Pathfinder web sites, including this one, place a "cookie" in the browser files of a Pathfinder user's computer. The cookie itself does not contain any personally identifying information. Although the cookie could enable Pathfinder to relate a user's use of Pathfinder to information that the user has specifically and knowingly provided, Pathfinder does not do so for any kids sites. Users should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personal information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas, that information can be collected and used by others and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or parties. **KIDS** : Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself to us or anyone else over the Internet. Users can send e-mail to us at [privacy@pathfinder.com](mailto:privacy@pathfinder.com) with any further questions.
