At the Dreamhomesource.com, user privacy is of utmost concern.  We are committed to your privacy and security, and to providing you the best possible user experience.  This policy may be updated by us from time to time, so please check here frequently. 

What do we mean by privacy?   We will never disclose your personally identifiable information  without your consent.

Here's how we collect and use information from you in our efforts to provide the highest quality user experience:

**IP Address -** Your IP or "Internet Protocol" address and other site usage data is used to gather broad demographic information.  This data helps us serve you by allowing us to understand how visitors use our web sites. 

**Cookies -** Our site use a technology called "cookies," small files stored by your browser to help keep track of your user profile.  Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, nor do we share them with anyone.  We use cookies to remember your personal profile for your convenience, and to deliver content specific to your needs and interests.  We also use cookies to track user trends and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.

**Your Security -** Dreamhomesource.com, and its affiliates have taken the following important measures to protect against loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.  First, we store no financial information or social security information on our sites.  Although you may have to enter your credit card number twice, we think the benefits of security are worth it.  When we do transmit your data, we use only Secure Servers using current encryption technology to encode your data safely. 

**Outside Links -** While on the Dreamhomesource.com site, you may be led to other web sites.  Be aware that other sites may collect data and personal information and operate according to their own privacy practices.  Please remember that, once outside of our family of sites, any information you submit is outside of our control.
