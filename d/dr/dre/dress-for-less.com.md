### Security Policy 

In order to process your order, we need your name, e-mail address, delivery address, credit/debit card number, expiry date, security number for credit cards (last 3 digits on the back of the card, where signature is) and online PIN for debit cards (as supplied to you by your bank). This information remains strictly confidential. Credit card numbers are not stored by us. Debit card PIN numbers are not seen by us and are processed by Saferpay.

We search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search and share information about you and the conduct of your account with them, other lenders and relevant third parties. We check all details with fraud prevention agencies and if anyone gives us false or inaccurate information, which causes us to suspect fraud, we record it. We, and other organisations, use such records to make credit decisions and various kinds of insurance proposals and claims for you, members of your household and those with whom you are financially linked. This is done to prove identity for money laundering and fraud prevention. We may also use your information, including shopping habits, to open and run your credit account, including payment recovery, debtor tracing and for our marketing purposes. We may contact you for marketing purposes by mail, telephone, e-mail.

dress-for-less uses the latest encryption standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to make sure orders and personal data can only be read by our computers and staff.

### Internet Technologies 

### Google 

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service of Google Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses so-called "cookies", text files stored on your computer which facilitate an analysis of your use of the website. The information that the cookie generates about your use of this website is usually sent to and saved on a Google server in the USA. In case of an activation of the IP anonymisation on this website, however, your IP address will be shortened by Google within the member states of the European Union or in other contracting states of the agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional cases the full IP address will be disclosed to and shortened on a Google server in the USA. On behalf of the website operator, Google will use this information in order to evaluate your use of the website, to gather reports about website activities and to provide further services associated with the use of the website and the Internet towards the website operator.

The IP address transmitted from your browser through Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. You can prevent the cookies from being saved using a corresponding setting in your browser software; but we would like to make you aware that in this case it may not be possible to fully use all functions of this website. You can also prevent data recorded by the cookie related to your use of the website (including your IP address) from being sent to and processed by Google by downloading and installing the browser plug-in available under the following link: [Link](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de).

### What is a cookie and how does dress-for-less use them? 

We are using cookies on several websites, to make the visit on our website more attractive and to allow the use of certain functions. Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer. Most of our used cookies is deleted from your hard drive after the browser session(so-called session cookies). Other cookies remain on your computer and allow us to recognize your computer during your next visit (so-called long-term - cookies). These cookies are used to greet you with your username and spare you to re-enter your password or to fill out forms with your data in following orders.

You can prevent cookies from being saved in your browser by clicking the menu bar in your browser "Tools> Internet Options> Privacy" (Internet Explorer) or "Settings> Privacy" (Firefox). Please note that without cookies certain features on our website cannot be used.

### Re-Targeting 

Information on the website visitor''s surfing behaviour is collected on our pages in anonymised form for marketing purposes and is saved in cookies by means of so-called re-targeting technologies. This technique facilitates an analysis of the Internet users'' surfing behaviour by means of an algorithm so they can subsequently be notified about selective product recommendations as a suitable advertising banner when other websites are visited. We are convinced that the display of personalised, interest-based advertising is generally more interesting to the Internet user than advertising without such personal reference.

This form of advertising is carried out anonymously altogether. The data can by no means be used to personally identify the website visitor. The collected data are merely used to improve the promotional offers. There is no other use or transmission to third parties.

On each displayed banner there is usually an "i" (for information) which opens on mouseover and leads to a page on which the system is explained and an opt-out is offered on click. An opt-out cookie is set if you click on "opt-out" which disables the display of these banners in future.

There is no direct option to opt out on the Google banners. You can object to the completely anonymous analysis of your surfing behaviour through Google by clicking on the two following links for removal: [Google Austragung](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). More information on the Google technology can be gathered from the [Google data protection regulations](http://www.google.de/intl/de/privacy/privacy-policy.html).
