Most of the Online Community Services are offered for free but you need a Universal mandatory registration to surf Dream11's online games. The information about the user is collected by Dream11 as (i) information supplied by users and (ii) information automatically tracked while User's navigation on the Dream11 website.

All required information is specific and based on the kind of Game/ Service needed. The Information as supplied by the users enables us to improve our sites and provide you the most user-friendly Game experience. In some sites as in Casual Game Contests, we require your contact addresses.

To improve the effectiveness & usability of our Game sites for our users, we use "cookies", or such similar electronic tools to collect information to assign each visitor a unique random number as a User Identification (User ID) to understand the user's individual interests using the Identified Computer. Unless the User voluntarily identifies himself/herself (e.g. through registration), Dream11 has no way of knowing who the User is, even if we assign a cookie to the User's computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information supplied by the User. A cookie cannot read data off the User's hard drive. Our advertisers may also assign their own cookies to the User's browser (if the User clicks on their ad banners), a process that Dream11 does not control.

Dream11's web servers automatically collect limited information about User's computer's connection to the Internet, including User's IP address, when the User visits our site. (User's IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send data to the User -- such as the web pages viewed by the User). The User's IP address does not identify the User personally. Dream11 uses this information to deliver its web pages to Users upon request, to tailor it's site to the interests of it's users, to measure traffic within it's site and let advertisers know the geographic locations from where Dream11's visitors come.

Dream11 also includes links to other websites. Such websites are governed by their respective privacy policies, which are beyond Dream11's control. Once the User leaves Dream11's servers (the User can tell where he/she is by checking the URL in the location bar on the User's browser), use of any information provided by the User is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site which the User is visiting. That policy may differ from Dream11's own. If the User can't find the privacy policy of any of these sites via a link from the site's homepage, the User may contact the site directly for more information.

When Dream11 presents information to it's online advertisers -- to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our website -- it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our site.

Thus, we cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Further, any information you include in a posting to the discussion areas will be available to anyone with Internet access.

Dream11 also believes that the internet is an ever-evolving medium.
