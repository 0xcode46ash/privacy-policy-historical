# Microsoft DreamSpark - privacy & cookies

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy statement applies to the data collected by Microsoft through the Microsoft DreamSpark site (the “Site”); it does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services. 

Collection of Your Information 

We collect many kinds of information in order to operate effectively and provide you the best products, services and experiences we can. Some of this is information you provide directly to us. Some of it is information about how you interact with our products and services, including the browser you're using, your IP address, location, cookies or other unique IDs, the pages you visit and features you use. Some of it is available from other sources, including demographic data we purchase from other companies, that we may combine with the data we collect directly. Regardless of the source, we believe it's important to treat that information with care and to help you maintain your privacy. The personal information we collect may include name, phone, email address, country of residence, and educational institution. 

How we collect:  
We use a number of methods and technologies to gather information about how you use our Site, such as:  
• Web forms, such as when you type information into a registration form or type a search query into a search box.  
• Technologies like cookies and web beacons (Please visit [this web page](http://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement) to learn more about these technologies).   
• Web logging, which enables us to collect the standard information your browser sends to every web site you visit - such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the site you came from - as well as the pages you visit and the links you click while using our sites and services. 

Use of Your Information 

Microsoft uses the information we collect to operate, improve and personalize the products and services we offer and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. Information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services to give you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with us. We may also supplement this with information from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies to help us derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area. 

We also may use the information to communicate with you, for example, informing you when a subscription is ending, letting you know when security updates are available or letting you know when you need to take action to keep your account active. 

Sharing Personal Information 

In addition to any sharing described in this privacy statement, Microsoft may share or disclose personal information:   
• With other Microsoft controlled subsidiaries and affiliates.   
• As part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets.  
• With vendors or agents. Specifically, we may share it with companies we've hired to provide services on our behalf. When we share information with these other companies to provide services for us, they are not allowed to use it for any other purpose and must keep it confidential. 

We also may share or disclose personal information, including the content of your communications:  
• To comply with the law or respond to legal process or lawful requests, including from law enforcement and government agencies.  
• To protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including enforcing the terms governing your use of the services.   
• To act on a good faith belief that access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers or the public.   
Except as described in this statement, we won’t disclose personal information you provide on the Site to a third party without your consent.  
Please note that our sites may include links to third-party sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Microsoft. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by the privacy statements on those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy statement of any site you visit. 

Access to Your Personal Information 

Some Microsoft services give you the ability to view or edit your personal information online. To help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you first will be required to sign in. The method(s) for accessing your personal information will depend on which sites or services you have used. You can review and edit the personal information you provided at this Site by contacting the [DreamSpark Program Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20131205180709id_/https%3A//www.dreamspark.com/Student/Support.aspx). 

Security of Your Information 

Microsoft is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.   
If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share it. If you are sharing a computer, you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. 

Where Information is Stored and Processed 

Personal information collected on Microsoft sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country where Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.   
Microsoft may retain your personal information for a variety of reasons, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and as long as necessary to provide services. To learn how to access your personal information, [contact the DreamSpark Program Team](https://web.archive.org/web/20131205180709id_/https%3A//www.dreamspark.com/Student/Support.aspx). 

Our Use of Cookies 

Most Microsoft web sites use "cookies," which are small text files placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies contain text that can be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. That text often consists of a string of numbers and letters that uniquely identifies your computer, but may contain other information as well. Here is an example of the text stored in a cookie that Microsoft might place on your hard disk when you visit one of our web sites: E3732CA7E319442F97EA48A170C99801  
We may use cookies for:  
• **Storing your Preferences and Settings**. If you enter your city or postal code to get local news or weather information on a Microsoft site, we may store that city or postal code in a cookie so that you will see the relevant local information when you return to the site. This can save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information every time you visit the site.   
• **Sign-in and Authentication**. When you sign in to a site using your Windows Live ID, we store your unique ID number, and the time you signed in, in an encrypted cookie on your hard disk. This cookie allows you to move from page to page at the site without having to sign in again on each page. When you sign out, these cookies are deleted from your computer. We also use cookies to improve the sign-in experience. For example, your e-mail address may be stored in a cookie that will remain on your computer after you sign out. This cookie allows your e-mail address to be pre-populated, so that you will only need to type your password the next time you sign in. If you are using a public computer or do not want this information to be stored, you can select the appropriate radio button on the sign-in page, and this cookie will not be used.  
• **Site Analytics**. We may use cookies to count the number of unique visitors to a web page or to develop other aggregate statistics about the operations of our sites and services. These analytics help us operate and improve the performance of these sites and services. 

Some of the cookies we commonly use are listed in the following chart. This list is not exhaustive, but it is intended to illustrate some of the reasons we set cookies. If you visit one of our web sites, the site may set some or all of the following cookies:

 **Cookie name**|  **Description**  
---|---  
userSessionID| Stores userid of user signed in with MAP account  
CultureInfo| Stores locale of site  
GuestUserSelectedLocale| Stores locale of site for anonymous user  
UserLocaleFromUserProfile| Stores locale of user signed in with Microsoft Account  
WelcomeUserString| Stores welcome name of user signed in with Microsoft Account  
userLiveEmailID| Stores email address of user signed in with Microsoft Account  
userSessionId_ds| Stores usersessionid of user signed in with Microsoft Account  
  
In addition to the cookies Microsoft may set when you visit our web sites, third parties may set certain cookies on your hard drive when you visit Microsoft sites. In some cases, that is because we have hired the third party to provide certain services on our behalf, such as site analytics. In other cases, it is because our web pages contain content from third parties, such as videos, news content or ads delivered by other ad networks. Because your browser connects to those third parties’ web servers to retrieve that content, those third parties are able to set or read their own cookies on your hard drive. 

How to Control Cookies 

• **Browser Controls to Block Cookies**. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to block cookies.   
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may block cookies by taking the following steps:

1\. Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options”  
2\. Click the “Privacy” tab at the top of the window  
3\. Move the slider up or down to select the types of cookies you wish to block

Instructions for blocking cookies in other browsers are available at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/>.  
Please be aware that if you choose to block cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Microsoft sites and services that depend on cookies.   
• **Browser Controls to Delete Cookies**. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later.   
For example, in Internet Explorer 9, you may delete cookies by taking the following steps:

1\. Click “Tools” and then select “Internet Options”  
2\. On the “General” tab, under “Browsing History,” click the “Delete” button  
3\. On the pop-up, select the box next to “Cookies”   
4\. Click the “Delete” button

Instructions for deleting cookies in other browsers are available at <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/>.  
Please be aware that if you choose to delete cookies, any settings and preferences controlled by those cookies, will be deleted and may need to be recreated.   
• **Browser Controls for “Do Not Track” and Tracking Protection**. Some newer browsers have incorporated “Do Not Track” features. Most of these features, when turned on, send a signal or preference to the web sites you visit indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Those sites may continue to engage in activities you might view as tracking even though you have expressed this preference, depending on the sites’ privacy practices.   
Internet Explorer 9 has a feature called Tracking Protection that helps prevent the web sites you go to from automatically sending details about your visit to third-party content providers. When you add a Tracking Protection List, Internet Explorer will block third-party content, including cookies, from any site that is listed as a site to be blocked. By limiting calls to these sites, Internet Explorer will limit the information these third-party sites can collect about you. And when you have a Tracking Protection List enabled, Internet Explorer will send a Do Not Track signal or preference to the web sites you visit. For more information about Tracking Protection Lists and how to find them, please see the Internet Explorer [privacy statement](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/products/ie-9/windows-internet-explorer-9-privacy-statement) or Internet Explorer Help. 

Our Use of Web Beacons 

Microsoft web pages may contain electronic images known as web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to help deliver cookies on our sites, let us count users who have visited those pages and deliver co-branded services. We may include web beacons in our promotional e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon.  
Microsoft sites may contain web beacons from third parties to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other web site operations. These web beacons may allow the third parties to set or read a cookie on your computer. We prohibit third parties from using web beacons on our sites to collect or access your personal information. Nevertheless, you may be able to opt out from data collection or use by these third-party analytics companies by clicking the links for each of the following analytics providers:   
• Omniture (Adobe): <http://www.d1.sc.omtrdc.net/optout.html>   
• Nielsen: [http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices](http://www.nielsen-online.com/corp.jsp?section=leg_prs&nav=1#Optoutchoices)   
• Coremetrics: <http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.php#optout>   
• Visible Measures: <http://corp.visiblemeasures.com/viewer-settings>   
• Google Analytics: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> (requires you to install a browser add-on) 

Other Similar Technologies 

In addition to standard cookies and web beacons, web sites can use other technologies to store and read data files on your computer. This may be done to maintain your preferences or to improve speed and performance by storing certain files locally. But, like standard cookies, it can also be used to store a unique identifier for your computer, which can then be used to track behavior. These technologies include Local Shared Objects (or “Flash cookies”) and Silverlight Application Storage.   
• **Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies.”** Web sites that use Adobe Flash technologies may use Local Shared Objects or “Flash cookies” to store data on your computer. Note that the ability to clear Flash cookies may or may not be controlled by your browser setting for standard cookies as that may vary by browser. To manage or block Flash cookies, go to <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>  
• **Silverlight Application Storage**. Web sites or applications that use Microsoft Silverlight technology also have the ability to store data by using Silverlight Application Storage. To learn how to manage or block such storage, go to <http://www.microsoft.com/getsilverlight/get-started/install/privacy.aspx>. 

Children 

When a Microsoft site or service collects age information, it will either block users under 13 or will ask them to provide consent from a parent or guardian before they can use it. We will not knowingly ask children under 13 to provide more information than is necessary to provide the service.   
When consent is granted, the child's account is treated much like any other account. The child may have access to communication services like e-mail, instant messaging and online message boards and may be able to communicate freely with other users of all ages.   
Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children's personal information. For example, on Windows Live, parents can visit their Account, and click on "[Parental Permissions](https://account.live.com/summarypage.aspx)". 

Communications 

If you receive promotional e-mails from us and would like to stop getting them in the future, you can do so by following the directions in that message.  
Depending on the respective service, you may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional e-mail, telephone calls, and postal mail from particular Microsoft sites or services by visiting and signing into the following pages:
