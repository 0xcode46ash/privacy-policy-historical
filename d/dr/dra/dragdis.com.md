# Dragdis

Dragdis's products and services are provided by UAB Dragdis and Dragdis, LLC (hereinafter, “we,” “us,” and “our”). This Privacy Policy governs your use of Dragdis's website and products. By accessing or using our products, you agree to be bound by this Privacy Policy and by our Terms of Service. 

### How do we collect information?

We collect information in two ways:

**1\. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.**  
When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This may include your name, email address that you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. 

You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Dragdis, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts. The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies. 

**2\. When you use our products.**  
In most cases, every time you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products. Here are some of the types of information we collect in this way:

Log Data. When you use Dragdis, our servers may automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This log data may include without limitation your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Dragdis, your browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Dragdis.

Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Dragdis account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Dragdis settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Dragdis.

Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device that you're using to access Dragdis, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPad or a Surface. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider. 

### How do we use the information we collect?

We use the information we collect to provide our products to you and make them better, develop new products, and protect Dragdis and our users. For example, we may log how often people use two different versions of a product, which can help us understand which version is better.

We also use the information we collect to offer you customized content -- including helping you discover things that you might like or provide you with tailored advertising. For example, if you've saved content related to baseball, we may suggest other baseball-related content.

We also use the information we collect to send you updates, newsletters, marketing materials and other information that may be of interest to you. For example, depending on your email notification settings, we may send you weekly updates that include items that you may like or find interesting. You can decide to stop getting these updates by updating your account settings (or through other settings we may provide). However, you may not disable essential system messages, because we may need to inform you of very important things related to Dragdis or to your account.

The information we collect may be "personally identifiable" (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or "non-personally identifiable" (meaning it can't be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. We may use or store information wherever Dragdis does business, including countries outside your own.

We may employ third party companies or individuals to process personal information on our behalf based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy. For example, we may share data with a security consultant to help us get better at identifying spam or with our accountants to make sure we’re keeping the books correctly. In addition, some of the information we request may be collected by third party providers on our behalf.

If we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights, or property of the public, any person, or Dragdis; or to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.

We may engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy.

We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with our partners or others. 

### What choices do I have about my information?

Our goal is to give you simple and meaningful choices over your information. If you have a Dragdis account, many of the choices you have on Dragdis are built directly in to the product or your account settings. For example, you can:  
Link or unlink your Dragdis account from an account on another service (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). For some services (like Facebook), you can also choose whether or not to publish your activity on Dragdis to that service.  
Close your account at any time. When you close your account, we'll deactivate it and remove your content from Dragdis. We may retain archived copies of your information as required by law or for legitimate business purposes (including to help address fraud and spam).  
You may have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Dragdis. For example, the browser you use may provide you with the ability to control cookies or other types of local data storage. 

### How do we make changes to this policy?

We may change this policy from time to time, and if we do we’ll post any changes on this page. If you continue to use Dragdis after those changes are in effect, you agree to the revised policy. If the changes are significant, we may provide more prominent notice or obtain your consent as required by law.
