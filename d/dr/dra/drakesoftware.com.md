Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy is designed to answer your questions about the information Drake Software
collects on its websites and mobile applications. It applies to the drakesoftware.com website,
and other related websites and mobile applications where this policy appears in the footer of the
page (collectively referred to as the "Sites").
Types of Information We Collect
The information we collect about you falls into the following two categories:
     Personal Information—information that tells us who you are or that provides
     information about you (such as your order history and preferences), and
     Technical Information—information about your visit that is not linked to your identity
The Personal Information we collect when you use our Sites may include your name, mailing
address, phone number, and email address. We request Personal Information when you order a
product or service, use our mobile applications, register for newsletters, participate in certain
promotional activities, fill out surveys, participate in online demonstrations, register for online
training, contact Drake support, engage in bank transactions and correspond with us.
When you visit our Sites, we also collect technical information such as the website you visited
before our Site, the pages you visit on our Sites, the website you visit next, the browser you use,
your computer's IP address, and any search terms entered on our Sites. We use cookies (see
section "Use of Cookies") and other technology to collect this data. In general, we do not
connect this Technical Information with the Personal Information we collect from you.
How We Use Information
We use all the information we collect to provide our customers with superior service and a
smooth, efficient, and personalized experience when using our Sites. In particular, we use
information for the following types of activities:
We use Personal Information to fill product orders and service and information requests, send
you order confirmations, administer your account, and send you marketing communications.
For example, we use the information for delivery, payment, and customer service.
We use Technical Information, on an aggregated basis, to understand customer behavior and
demographics, to help run our Sites more efficiently and monitor the level of activity on our
Sites, and to evaluate the effectiveness of our advertising.
If you contact us, we may also save your correspondence or comments. We use this
information to help us provide better service in the event you contact us again.


We may also use the information we collect from you to provide you with advertisements
about our products and services on the Sites and on other websites, to protect the security
and integrity of the Sites and our business, and as otherwise indicated in our Terms of Use.
If you do not wish to receive future advertisements from us via email, you can unsubscribe
or opt‐out of receiving future email advertisements, and we will process your request
within ten (10) business days.
Security
When you make a purchase on the Sites, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption
technology to safeguard your credit card information while it is being sent to us. The SSL
encryption is designed to make the information unreadable by anyone but us. This security
measure is working when you see either the symbol of an unbroken key or closed lock
(depending on your browser) on the bottom of your browser window.
We take the protection of your data very seriously. All data collected through our Sites is
protected by a secure server. In addition, we use SSL to secure the transmission of data
from the internet to our systems.
All data is maintained and backed‐up on a regular schedule to provide adequate redundancy and
ensure that the integrity of information is never jeopardized.
All of our employees are subject to strict guidelines regarding confidentiality, and internal
access to your data is limited to those employees with a business reason for using such data.
All of our employees sign non‐disclosure agreements to protect your data. We also take
appropriate disciplinary measures whenever necessary to enforce these rules.
We make every commercially reasonable effort to be fully compliant with the rules under
sections 6713 and 7216 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Information Sharing
In general, we disclose customer information to other companies for only the following
reasons:
         to assist credit card processors, and other companies that perform services for us
         and who have agreed not to use any of our information for any other purpose;
         to assist a government investigation, verification or similar purposes, if required by law,
         subpoena or court order, or otherwise necessary for fraud prevention or to maintain
         the security and integrity of the Sites and our business, or as needed to enforce our
         Terms of Use, or to a company that purchases our business or assets.
Third‐Party Providers
We do not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to third parties.


We partner with third party companies that provide specific services such as bank products.
When you sign up for services or products of a third party with which we conduct business,
such as tax refund bank products, we will share your name or contact information to the extent
necessary for the third party to provide such products or services. These parties are not
granted permission to use personally identifiable information for any purpose other than
providing these services.
We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of carefully selected third‐party providers
about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique
personally identifiable information (e‐mail, name, address, telephone number) is not
transferred to the third party.
Use of Cookies
A "cookie" is a small text file transferred by a website or mobile applications to your computer's
hard drive. We send cookies when you browse our Sites, make purchases, respond to online
surveys or polls, or request information. Accepting the cookies used on our Sites does not give
us access to your Personal Information, but we can use the cookies to identify your computer.
The aggregate information collected permits us to analyze traffic patterns on our Sites. This
can enable us over time to provide you with a better experience on our Sites, by improving the
content and making them easier to use. For example, cookies can keep track of what you have
selected to purchase as you continue to shop and allow you to enter your password only once
on pages where a login is required.
Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies or selectively
accept certain cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. If you turn off cookies,
there may be some features of our Sites that will not be available to you and some web pages
may not display properly.
Links to other Websites
Our Sites may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that Drake Software is not
responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be
aware when they leave our Sites and to read the privacy policies of each and every website
that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the
information collected by the Sites of Drake Software and no other sites.
Children's Privacy
Our Sites are not targeted at children of any age, and we do not collect information from any
children under age 13.
Changes to this Privacy Notice
If there are changes to the terms of this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here. Please
be sure to check this page occasionally. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, such


as changes in the way we use or disclose Personal Information, we will provide you with notice
of the change and a chance to choose not to have your information used or disclosed under the
revised Privacy Policy. By using the Sites, you are deemed to have accepted any changes to this
Privacy Policy.
