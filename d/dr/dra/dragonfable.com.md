**I. Free Accounts**  
DragonFable has a large portion of the game available to the users for free. In order to register a character for the free version of the game, the only information that DragonFable collects is the user’s e-mail address. The e-mail address is used for the following purposes:  
1\. To send a confirmation notice to the user of their character registration and password information.  
2\. Upon the user’s request, to send the user password information when the user has lost or forgotten the password.  
3\. In response to any question, concerns or problem that the user contacted DragonFable about.   
4\. To contact the user about any problem with the user’s account or conduct in the game.  
5\. To send out a newsletter*.

* DragonFable game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the current events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that DragonFable has designed and made available exclusively to our users. In addition, DragonFable may send promotional items and advertisements from the sponsors, however DragonFable will not divulge your personal information to the sponsor directly.

**II. Subscriber Accounts**  
A Subscriber Account is a paid membership account that provides our users with additional access and privileges while playing DragonFable. The Subscriber Account requires and uses all of the information listed under the Free Account in the same manner. In addition to the above, however, we will require you to provide the following information:  
1) First and last name  
2) Address, city, state and zip code  
3) Home telephone number

We are copied with this information by PayPal (see Security and Credit Card Use below) and require this information for the sole purpose of verifying your account and payment information.

The DragonFable message board is a place for users of the game to interact by posting messages. The message board must be signed up for separately from the game and is subject to TERMS OF USE.

DragonFable encourages parents and legal guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents and legal guardians to instruct their children to never give out their personal information online without permission. We also recognize a special need to protect personal information obtained from children. In compliance with Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), we have adopted the following policies regarding children under the age of 14 (“Children”):

**Type and Use of Information Collected from Children**  
Parents of children under the age of 13 who wish to allow their children access to the Site or Services must create an account on behalf of their child. When you create a child’s account, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child using the account. Accordingly, as the legal guardian, it is your responsibility to determine whether any of the Service areas and/or Content are appropriate for your child. By creating a child’s account, you also give your child permission to access many areas of the Service, including email and message boards (among others). By creating a child’s account, you do not give your child permission to purchase account upgrades or other items by credit card or any other means. To purchase account upgrades or other products, you must represent that you are at least 18 years old. When you purchase account upgrades or other products on behalf of a child under the age of 18, you certify that you are at least 18 years old and that you are the legal guardian of the child. 

To create a Subscriber Account, DragonFable does require an e-mail address as well as the parent’s correct billing information as outlined under the Subscriber Accounts section. The setting up of the account by the parents is considered an actual verifiable consent by the parent for the child to use this website as required by COPPA.

For Subscriber Accounts, we use your child’s e-mail address for the following purposes:  
1\. To send a confirmation notice to the child of their character registration and password information.  
2\. Upon the child’s request, to send the user password information when the child has lost or forgotten the password.  
3\. In response to any questions, concerns or problems that the child contacted DragonFable about.*   
4\. To contact the child about any problem with the child’s account or conduct in the game.  
5\. To send out a newsletter**.

*We recognize that young children may inadvertently give out personal information in addition to their e-mail address when contacting us with any questions, problems, or concerns they have encountered while playing the game. We do not collect or use any such additional personal information acquired in this manner unless it is necessary for us to respond to the problem or question or concern. We do not divulge any such information to any third parties unless we are required to do so by law, court order or subpoena.

** DragonFable game is unique in a sense that we design and run numerous special events that keep the game constantly fresh, challenging, fun and interesting for our users. Some of these events coincide with actual real life holidays, such as Valentine’s Day, other events are made up as we go along. We use the newsletter to notify our users of all the upcoming events, changes, improvements, upgrades, new characters, etc. In addition, occasionally we may notify our users of new products and services that DragonFable has designed and made available exclusively to our users. DragonFable may also forward promotions and advertisements from our sponsors, however DragonFable will not release any personal information to the sponsors directly.

If a child desires to upgrade his/her account to Subscriber Status, a parent or legal guardian will be required to divulge additional reasonably necessary information as described above under Subscriber Accounts.

DragonFable does not sell or knowingly divulge your child’s information to advertisers or any other third parties, unless we are required to share your child’s information with a third party in order to comply with law, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our site or game rules; to protect the safety and security of our users and our Web sites.

Also, please note that DragonFable does not condition a child’s participation in an online activity on the child providing more personal information than is reasonably necessary for the activity.

**Notification and Verifiable Parental Consent**  
For Subsciber Accounts, the receipt of payment is considered actual, verifiable consent from the parents to the child’s use of our website and to any information that was divulged as reasonably necessary to process payments, verify and maintain the account.

**How can parents access, change or delete personally identifiable information about their children?**  
Parents can find out what personally identifiable information is being kept by DragonFable about their child by e-mailing df.privacy@battleon.com. Parents can then request to purge either all or specific portions of that information by e-mailing df.privacy@battleon.com.
