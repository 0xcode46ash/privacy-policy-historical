Version 3.0

Last Revised: 10.5.16

Drippler Ltd. (the “Company” or “we”) respects the privacy of the users (“User” or “you”) of its application, Drippler (the “App”) and is committed to protecting the information it collects and/or is disclosed to it by Users. We believe that you have the right to know our practices regarding the information we may collect while you use the App. The guidelines contained herein apply to your installation and/or use of the App and the services offered thereby (collectively, the “Services”).

  1. Collection of Information

We collect two basic types of data and information through your use of the Services.   



  1. General Information. The first type of information is non-personally identifiable information (“General Information”) that we collect while you access, browse, view or otherwise use the Services. In other words, when you access the Services we are aware of your usage of the Services, and may gather, collect and record the information relating to such usage.  General Information may contain, among other things:

  3. Extended Personal Information.  In addition, if you choose to register for any Services and/or access any Services in connection with an external social network (such as Facebook, Google+ or Twitter) (each an “External Network”) we may also collect certain additional elements of Personal Information, in accordance with the permissions that you grant us the first time that you registered for/accessed Services using your External Network profile which may include any of the following:

  * Advertisements and other sponsored content in the App that you have clicked on

  * Services you subscribe for including any Premium Services and any cancellation of any such subscription.



  2. Usage of Information




We are committed to protecting your privacy and earning your trust.  It is our intent to give you as much control as reasonably practicable over the privacy and use of your General Information and your Personal Information (together, your “Information”). The Information we collect is used mainly to enhance and improve your experience using the Services.  Generally speaking, the more Information that you volunteer to provide us, the better we are able to customize your experience.  

General Information is collected in order to:   

  * Enhance the User's experience on the App and/or Site (for instance, by determining the screen resolution).

  * Learn about the preferences of Users and general trends in the App usage (for instance, to understand which devices or queries are more popular than others).




Personal Information is collected in order to:   

  * Personalize your experience on the App.

  * Provide you with certain information and services relevant to Users like you (for example, content related to your specific mobile device).

  * Allow us to contact you with proposals and tailored information regarding events, offers, etc. in your area (for example, a sale on accessories for your mobile device in a store located nearby).

  * Identify you when conducting customer service operations (such as providing service feedback, etc.)



  3. Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties by Drippler




Other than as expressly described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not share your Personal Information with any third-party, except in the following cases (and then, only to the extent reasonably necessary under the circumstances): (a) to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process, subpoena or governmental request; (b) to enforce this Privacy Policy or the [Terms of Use](http://drippler.com/about/terms), including investigation of potential violations of it; (c) to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; (d) to respond to your support requests; (e) to respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties; (f) to respond to claims that contact information (e.g. phone number, name, etc.) of a third-party has been posted or transmitted without their consent or as a form of harassment; (g) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, its Users and the general public; (h) when the Company is undergoing any change in control, including by means of merger, acquisition or purchase of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (i) pursuant to your explicit approval, in order to supply certain services you have requested from Company.

  4. Sharing Personal Information with Third Parties by You 




This Privacy Policy does not apply to Information that you choose to share with others, for example, by using the Services in connection with an External Network.  For example, if you use the sharing functionalities to post on an External Network, the External Network - and anyone privy to your updates on the External Network - will also receive that information.   This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of any External Network or any other third-party.  

Furthermore, this Privacy Policy does not apply to any Information that you choose to share with a Tech Wizard in the App.  Please be aware that Tech Wizards are not employees or otherwise engaged by the Company and we do not supervise the conversations between you and any Tech Wizard.  We encourage you to use discretion when choosing what, if any, Personal Information to share with a Tech Wizard.  For your information, Tech Wizards do not have a need to know (and you are never required to share) your email address, physical address, phone number, or any credit card or other payment information or any other personally identifying information. A Tech Wizard may ask you to share basic information about your hardware or software and it is your decision whether to provide them with such information in order to provide you with more specific Advice in response to your query. Tech Wizards are prohibited from soliciting any fees from you. Please contact us immediately at [privacy@drippler.com](mailto:privacy@drippler.com) if you encounter any Tech Wizard violating this policy.   

  5. Advertising




From time to time, we may allow third-party advertisers (“Advertisers”) to sponsor advertising content or links (“Ads”) that can be directly accessed from within the Services.   In order to provide Ads that we think would be of most interest to our Users, we may share certain Information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) to Advertisers. However, before such Information is shared with the Advertisers, all Personal Information involved will be aggregated into anonymous statistics.  For example, we might provide an analysis of data that says “1000 Users in California who accessed the App in the month of June using a Samsung Galaxy S7 shared a Drip on Facebook about free off-line map applications for Android.”  That said, keep in mind that if you click through links to leave the App and go to the Advertisers’ sites, those sites may gather information about you.  This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of any Advertiser or any other third-party.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these third-parties, check out the [NAI (Network Advertising Initiative) website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

7. Security

We take great care in maintaining the security of our App and your Information and endeavor to take all commercially reasonable measures to prevent unauthorized access to your Information by using industry standard technology and internal procedures.  However, we do not guarantee that unauthorized access will never occur.  

Users who have registered for the Services agree to keep their password in strict confidence and not to disclose such password to any third-party.

8\. Third-Party Sites

While using the App and the Services you may encounter links to third-party sites. Please be advised that such sites are independent sites, and we assume no responsibility or liability whatsoever for them with regard to privacy matters or any other legal matter. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies and terms of use or service of such third-party sites.

9. Changes to the Privacy Policy and Privacy Laws

The terms of this Privacy Policy will govern the use of the Services and any information collected therein. We reserve the right to change this policy at any time, so please re-visit this page as often as you wish. In case of any material change, we will post a clear notice on the App. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective as of the stated “Last Update” written above and your continued use of the Services on or after the Last Update date will constitute acceptance of, and agreement to be bound by, those changes.

You hereby acknowledge that: (i) the state of the law with respect to behavioral advertising, contextual advertising, cookies, personally identifiable information, and informational privacy is unsettled; and (ii) subsequent to the effective date of this Privacy Policy, new or changes in existing applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations, or a change in governing self-regulatory best practices (a “Change in Law”) may hold that the operation of the Services (in whole or in part), the collection and use of data and cookies, or other activities as contemplated under this Privacy Policy, is not permissible as set forth herein. We do not make any representations or warranties with respect to such Changes in Law, and hereby expressly disclaim any representations, warranties, guarantees, covenants, or obligations relating thereto.

10. Deleting Your Personal Information

If your personal information changes or if you no longer desire to use the Services, you may correct inaccuracies or delete your information/account by making your changes within your account or by emailing us at [privacy@drippler.com](mailto:privacy@drippler.com).  We will take all commercially reasonable efforts to delete your Personal Information from our records (other than what we may be required to keep under applicable law or in order to enforce the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use) within thirty (30) days of receipt of your request.  You may also revoke, at any time, the permissions that you have granted to us by accessing the Services via an External Network.  

11.  Privacy of Children

The Services are intended for a general audience.  We do not knowingly collect Information from anyone under the age of thirteen (13) or have any reasonable grounds for believing that anyone under the age of 13 is accessing our App or using our Services. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected Personal Information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. As part of good  practice, parents are encouraged to monitor their minor children’s use of the Tech Wizard chat feature in the App.  If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at [privacy@drippler.com](mailto:privacy@drippler.com). 

12.  California Residents

Under California law, Users who are residents of California are permitted to request and obtain from us a list of what Personal Information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year (if any) and the names and addresses of those third parties.  Requests may be made only once a year and are free of charge.  As of the date of the Last Update to this Privacy Policy (written above), we currently do not share any Personal Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

13\.  Consent to Processing and Transfer of Information

The Service is operated in Israel.  Given that we are an international business, our use of Information necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis.  If you are located in the European Union, Canada, Israel or elsewhere outside of the United States, please be aware that the Information we collect may be transferred to and processed in the United States.  By using the Service, or providing us with any Information, you consent to the collection, processing, maintenance, and transfer of such Information in and to the United States and other applicable territories in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as or equivalent to those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.
