**How we Enforce Security**   
To safeguard personally identifying information, we store all transaction records in limited access servers, safeguarded by encrypted access. We do this to protect the security of personal data as well as that of the servers themselves. We retain the personally identifying information only long enough to complete a purchase, to deter fraud, to provide customer service, and/or to maintain your account with us.

We may disclose and use personally identifying information in special circumstances where doing so is necessary to enforce our service agreements. For instance, we may invoke this disclosure if doing so will help us protect our intellectual property rights.

**SlimDrivers and DriverUpdate**

**What Information SlimDrivers and DriverUpdate Collects**   
The DriverUpdate and SlimDrivers Software does not collect any personally identifying information from your computer. Upon un-installation, both DriverUpdate and SlimDrivers do not leave any active or executable data on a customer's computer. A log and possible driver backups may be left on the hard drive. The log details the actions of SlimDrivers and DriverUpdate and records which driver updates are detected and which are installed. It is an inert text file, left as a courtesy to our customers and can be manually deleted or used as a future reference by users or support techs, regardless of whether or not those techs are associated with SlimDrivers and/or DriverUpdate.  


**Update Policy**   
Once installed, your copy of SlimDrivers and DriverUpdate will routinely check in with our server to receive updates. These updates constitute improvements, adjustments and repairs to the SlimDrivers and/or DriverUpdate program(s). The only data value transmitted to the server at this time is the current version of the installed software. The updating process can be moderated and/or disabled through the settings dialog in the application. By default the updates are retrieved after a notification confirming that an update is available.

**Policy Modifications**   
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be correspondingly posted here, so please check this page periodically. 

If you have any inquiries or concerns regarding this privacy policy, feel free to contact us at [_support@DriverUpdate.net_](mailto:support@DriverUpdate.net).
