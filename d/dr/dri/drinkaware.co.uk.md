# Privacy Policy | Drinkaware

### 1) Privacy and your personal data

Drinkaware is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This privacy policy (" **Privacy Policy** ") is intended to inform you how we gather, define, and utilise your Information (as defined below).

It applies to Information collected by us, or provided by you, over our Website or in any other way, such as over the telephone, via the 'Track and Calculate Units' Mobile App (the “ **App** ”), or in an email. It is also intended to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website.  Please take a minute to read and understand the policy.

This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms and Conditions. All your personal Information shall be held and used in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the " **Act** "). If you would like to know what information we collect and hold about you, please write to us at the address at the beginning of the Terms and Conditions (FAO the data protection officer).

The Drinkaware Trust is the data controller of your Information for the purposes of the Act.

### 2) What Information do we collect?

When you visit our Website or use the App you may provide us with personal information such as your name, address, email address, age, gender, phone number, and if you are using our Shop, your address and payment card details (" **Information** "). You may provide us with Information in a number of ways:

  1. by supplying us with the Information as listed above, on an individual basis by completing a Contact Us form on our Website, or by signing up to receive news, promotions, information or updates from us (including via the App);
  2. by using the MyDrinkaware tool, the Midlife Men tool, or any other tool available on our Website. To use these tools you may be required to provide your email address, gender and age, although you may choose to supply us with additional information, including information about your drinking habits, in which case this may be linked to your account and/or email address;



iii. by downloading the App: the only personal information you have to provide is an email address, your gender and year of birth. In addition, the information you upload to the App about your drinking habits, and the location of your device(s) and, if you have turned on your ‘Weak Spot’ functionality (as described below), your ‘Weak Spots’ will be received by us. All this Information will be linked to your email address and account;

  1. by registering to use our Shop and/or purchasing Products from us, in which case we will need your address, delivery address and payment card details;
  2. by corresponding with us by email, in which case we may retain the content of your email messages together with your email address and our responses.



We may also collect information about your computer or a device onto which you have downloaded the App, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type and the geographical location of your computer or device, for system administration, and we may report aggregate information to our stakeholders and funders. This is statistical data about browsing actions and patterns and does not identify you as an individual.

**“Weak Spot” Function**

Where you have chosen to use the ‘Weak Spot’ functionality, we may collect data relating to the location of your device. The ‘Weak Spot’ functionality allows you to share with us specific locations where you drink. We will then send drinking related reminders to your device if we identify that you are near such locations.

If you do not want to share with us the location of your device, do not enter a ‘Weak Spot’.

If you delete all your ‘Weak Spots’, we will no longer receive location data from your device. Alternatively, you may turn off the location settings on your device at any time by accessing the “Privacy” or “Permissions” section of the “Settings” of your Apple or Android device and by deactivating “Location Services” or “Location”.
