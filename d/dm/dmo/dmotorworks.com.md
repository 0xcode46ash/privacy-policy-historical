# Digital Motorworks' Privacy Policy

**Personal Information**   
Digital Motorworks, Inc. (DMI) recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals on the Internet. We believe that personally identifiable information such as customer name, address, phone/fax numbers, and email address is confidential. As a result, this information is securely stored in our database and **is not made available to outside parties** which are not directly involved with the purpose in which the information was gathered. For example, as a necessary part of processing your requests on the "Purchase Request" forms, we must share your contact information with your chosen dealer so that the dealer can respond. This information is only shared with that particular dealer. Additionally, if DMI is aggregating or consolidating electronic information from a business partner's legacy computer system, that information is used strictly within the bounds of the existing contractual agreement with that partner. 

Third party Internet sites and services accessible through affiliated Digital Motorworks web sites have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and we recommend you review their policies before transmitting personal information on those pages. 

**Respect for Competitive Nature of Certain Information**   
Due to the nature of many of Digital Motorworks' products and services, sensitive information from competing entities may be acquired by DMI. We are extremely protective of this information and do not share this information nor use this information for any purposes other than those described in the established agreements with each particular customer. In fact, our sole existence is based on the confidence of our customers in our ability to maintain accurate, honest, and impartial business relationships. 

**Security**   
DMI takes great measures to ensure that the information is secure in its databases and that critical password and account information is not stored externally. DMI also manages a sophisticated firewall to further protect its internal computer systems. If we ask for a credit card number or other sensitive financial information, it is always through our secure server using industry-standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Only authorized DMI employees have access to stored information and we continually assess new technology for protecting information. 

**Summary Information**   
DMI may track summary and statistical data regarding the usage of information and Internet sites within our network. Examples may include page hits, geographic and demographic information, search preferences, response rates, etc. reported in aggregated format, and not identifiable to any particular user or customer. 

We also participate in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine Privacy Program, and comply with all the BBBOnLine Privacy standards. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/). 

Our Customer Service Representatives are trained and available to assist with any questions or problems you might have with our privacy policies. At any time, you may also request to review or correct your personal information that we maintain in our database.
