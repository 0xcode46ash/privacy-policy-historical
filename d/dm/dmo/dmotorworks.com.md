# Digital Motorworks - Turning Data Into Opportunity

**Personal Information**  
Digital Motorworks, LP (DMi) recognizes the importance of protecting individual privacy on the Internet. We consider personally identifiable information such as customer name, address, phone/fax numbers, e-mail address, company name and title to be confidential. As a result, this information is securely stored in our database and is not made available to outside parties that are not directly involved with the purpose in which the information was gathered. 

Purposes for which personally identifiable information may be collected include DMi's internal marketing efforts and the inventory, customer relationship management (CRM) and data analytics initiatives of DMi's customers and partners. For example, as a necessary part of processing customer requests submitted through online "Purchase Request" forms, we must share contact information with the customer's chosen dealer. This information is only shared with that particular dealer. Additionally, if DMi is aggregating or consolidating electronic information from a business partner's legacy computer system, that information is used strictly within the bounds of the existing contractual agreement with that partner. You may opt-out of any unrelated use of information by contacting [support@digitalmotorworks.com](mailto:support@digitalmotorworks.com).

Third party Internet sites and services accessible through affiliated DMi web sites maintain their own privacy policies and data collection practices. We have no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and we recommend you review them before transmitting personal information on those pages. 

**Respect for Competitive Nature of Certain Information**  
Due to the nature of DMi's InfoIQ solutions, DMi may acquire sensitive information from competing entities. We do not share this information or use it for any purposes other than those described in the established agreements with each of our customers. We strictly maintain accurate, honest, and impartial business relationships at all times.

**Security**   
DMi recognizes the sensitive nature of our clients' data. We have therefore implemented numerous measures to ensure its security, including building redundant security measures into our technology, co-locating our servers at state-of-the-art facilities, providing strictly controlled Web access to our services, and establishing disaster recovery plans.

**Summary Information**   
DMi may track summary and statistical data regarding the usage of information and Internet sites within our network. Examples may include page hits, geographic and demographic information, search preferences, response rates, etc. reported in aggregated format, and not identifiable to any particular user or customer. 

Our InfoIQ Support team is trained and available to assist with any questions or problems you might have with our privacy policies. At any time, you may also request to review or correct your personal information that we maintain in our database. Feel free to contact us at [support@digitalmotorworks.com](mailto:support@digitalmotorworks.com) for further assistance.
