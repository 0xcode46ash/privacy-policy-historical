# Privacy Policy | MVC | NJ

DMV.com values your right to privacy. This policy is effective as of December 9th, 2008 and governs the collection of personal information from [http://www.dmv.com](http://www.dmv.com/) and all its subdomains as of this date. DMV.com IS A PRIVATELY OWNED WEBSITE THAT IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCY OR DEPARTMENT. As such, we do not have access too, collect or attempt to identify you from any information you may have logged at any government agency or department.

This policy explains the types of information DMV.com collects from its visitors/users and how that information is used. Please read this policy carefully.

## Information Collection

### 1\. Unregistered users

If you do not register for DMV.com it is not possible for you to actively edit our content. At this time only registered users have permission to edit the wiki articles on the website. If you are not registered we collect very limited personal information. We log IP addresses in order to troubleshoot our technical problems, administer the website and track usage statistics. Your IP address may vary each time you visit, or it may be the same, depending how you access the internet. Regardless, it would be very difficult to identify a user from an IP address and WE MAKE NO ATTEMPT TO IDENTIFY YOU. If you reach our site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, then we may also log that information for tracking purposes (so we can understand our presence on the internet). All of this information is collected and used only in the aggregate to generate overall reports on our visitors as a whole, but not reports about individual visitors.

We also use cookies (and/or similar technology) which are placed on your computer's hard drive to maintain the integrity of our content and to provide our users with a better site experience. A cookie may contain information that allows us to track your path through our Web site and to determine whether you have visited us before. However, unless you register with us, it contains no personally identifiable information that would allow us to identify you. Cookies cannot be used to read data off of your hard drive, and cannot retrieve information from any other cookies created by other Web sites. We use cookies in this manner to help us understand how visitors use our site, and to help us to improve our site. You are free to block any of our cookies through your web browser however you may find this negatively affects the overall usability of our site.

### 2\. Registered users

Registered users on DMV.com are able to actively add and edit articles on our website. Any additions or edits you make to our content are subject to review by our moderators. All of the above information may also apply to registered users as it does to unregistered users.

WHEN YOU REGISTER, WE COLLECT A LIMITED AMOUNT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT MAY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: YOUR NAME, EMAIL ADDRESS, USER NAME, PASSWORD, WHETHER YOU HAVE AUTO INSURANCE, AND THE STATE IN WHICH YOU LIVE. We only collect the information that you manually enter into our forms. We may store all or some of that information in a cookie file on your hard drive. This way we can recognize you when you return to the website so you can avoid re-entering your login information. We do not provide any third-parties with your personal information that you enter in our registration form. Your username may be displayed on the website when you add or edit content using our wiki feature, however, we do not require but in fact suggest that your username contain no personal information which may identify you to other users of this website. We will never disseminate or display your email address. If you fill out a form for one of our advertising partners we may pass on information including your name, state or other information you have entered into the form to our partners. We have protected the site with an SSL certificate in an effort to protect the privacy of this information on our site and when transmitted to our partners. We cannot guarantee the complete privacy of this information and you should review the privacy policies of our partners in order to ensure you are satisfied with their treatment of your private information.

## Usage of Collected Information

We use the information we collect from you in order to improve our website. The information for non-registered users may be used so we can improve the structure, look-and-feel, articles and other aspects of the physical website. For registered users we may also use your information so that you are automatically recognized when you use our site. This will allow you to come to the site and actively add and edit content without being forced to sign-in at every visit. We may use your personal information to periodically contact you with news about DMV.com or the DMV.com community. Also, we may contact you periodically regarding your edits and additions to our website. We do not sent regular emails or newsletters.

We may also use certain personal information in order to manage the advertising displayed on our website. This benefits both of us because advertising helps us to us continue to operate DMV.com and because you see advertising that may be more appropriate or interesting to you. We may also pass on a limited amount of your personal information to our advertising partners if you choose to click on their advertisements but we will not include any information that will allow you to be personally identified.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

DMV.com does not sell, rent or disseminate in any way personal information to any third party, other than our partners, as discussed in this policy. We may aggregate personal information and provide that information in aggregate to parties, including advertisers, for marketing and promotional purposes. However, if we do so, that information will not be in a form that will allow any third party to identify you personally.

We also may share your personal information with third-parties specifically engaged by DMV.com to provide services to DMV.com (such as market research firms, marketing services providers and advertising agencies), in which case we will require those parties to agree to use any such personally-identifiable data solely for the purpose of providing the specified services to DMV.com.

As a private for profit website not affiliated with any government agencies, DMV.com must cooperate with legal authorities, and may in some circumstances be required to disclose personally identifiable information in response to requests from law enforcement authorities, or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. We can also turn over information about you if we believe we must in order to prevent a violation of the law, and by accepting this policy, you consent to our doing so, in our sole discretion. You also consent to our disclosing information about you in the course of legal proceedings if we are legally required to do so, if we reasonably believe that doing so may mitigate our liability, or if doing so will assist us in enforcing our legal rights. We also may share your information in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, and in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.

Your profile on DMV.com may be publicly viewable via your username. DMV.com will not share your email address with any other members nor display it any public manner. If you choose to participate in our member-to-member communications programs, you may be contacted by other DMV.com members, using DMV.com as an intermediary. All DMV.com members will have the option to turn off the member-to-member communication features at any time.

## Review, Change, Delete Your Personal Information

## Steps we take to protect your personal information

DMV.com has implemented security procedures to help protect the personal information stored in our systems. For example, we limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information. We also employ processes such as idle session termination to protect against unauthorized access to your personal information. Be aware that we do not guarantee the security of your personal information.

## Privacy for Children
