## Sharing Information

DMI may share user’s Personal Information with third parties in the following scenarios:

  * When users provide Personal Information in connection with a job search, it is maintained in a database that is managed by a third party service provider.

  * DMI may provide users Personal Information to companies that provide services on DMI’s behalf. Such companies may include a payment processor or customer service provider. These companies are authorized to use Personal Information in order to provide such services to DMI. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.
  * DMI shares users Personal Information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process; and when DMI believes, in good faith, that disclosure is necessary to protect DMI’s rights, protect user’s safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.
