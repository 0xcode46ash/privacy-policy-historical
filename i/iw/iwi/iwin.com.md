PRIVACY POLICY 

1\. We will never give out any information linking your real name to your screen name unless you authorize us to do so, or unless required to do so by law. If served with a subpoena, search warrant, or court order, Uproar would provide the necessary information. In addition, we may give your address to a third party for the purposes of prize fulfillment. 

2\. We will not provide any personally identifiable information about you to advertisers or other partners without prior notification and your expressed prior consent. Uproar may provide advertisers and/or other partners with aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns. Uproar may decide to enhance or merge the information collected at its site with data from third parties, but this information will not be shared with advertisers or partners, except in aggregate form. 

3\. Uproar does track certain general usage pattern information. Uproar may track certain types of information, including: what games people play, how long they have been Uproar members ("Member") and if they have won. This information is used in aggregate form to improve the Uproar Network and may be provided, in aggregate form, to advertisers and partners. 

4\. Uproar uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites. Uproar will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. In order to use the Uproar sites, your browser must accept cookies. 

5\. Uproar logs Members' IP addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, diagnostic, site tracking and reporting of aggregate usage information to our advertisers as well as tracking acquisition of PrizePoints. Uproar does not link IP addresses to information identifying Members individually. 

6\. Uproar may use your personal information to target advertisements to you. Uproar may use the information provided at registration (first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; month and year of birth; gender and e-mail address) or information obtained through third parties to target advertisements to you. Targeting is used to customize and enhance your Uproar experience by providing you with the most appropriate advertisements. Such targeting is beneficial in that it helps you to make informed decisions about different products and services. The actual targeting is done via our ad server and the advertiser does not see your personally identifiable information. Use of information provided at registration or obtained through third parties will not be provided to advertisers or partners, except in aggregate form. An Uproar Member may change or update his or her personal information at any time by visiting the Member Services area of our site. 

7\. Uproar uses a third party to serve advertisements to you. Uproar uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our Web site. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of our third party ad server, please [_click here_](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/default.asp?asp_object_1=&) __.

8\. You are not required to receive any mailings that you do not wish to receive. During the registration process, you have the option to sign up to receive the Uproar Newsletter, sponsor offers and Uproar Reminder Service e-mails. If you wish to discontinue receiving these items, you may change your subscription preferences by visiting your [My Mail page](http://www.iwin.com/myuproar/mymail.asp).Â  You will need your password to access your Member Profile. If you have forgotten your password, you may obtain it by visiting the _Forgot Your Password_ page and providing your e-mail address. At no time will an Uproar employee or company representative ask for your password via e-mail. If you ever receive such an inquiry, please notify Uproar Member Services immediately at _memberservices@uproar.com_. 

9\. You do not have to participate in any surveys. From time to time, Uproar may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an Uproar Member. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in aggregate form for further marketing purposes. In games developed with a partner, we may share the aggregated information with the partner. We will clearly inform you in advance if the information is going to be shared. All third parties with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices and Uproar has no responsibility or liability for their policies or actions. 

10\. Uproar will not store any e-mail or contact information obtained through the use of the "Tell A Friend" feature. Uproar's "Tell A Friend" feature permits you to invite a friend to play the Uproar games. If you elect to use this feature, Uproar will not store your friend's e-mail address or contact information in our database. 

11\. Uproar has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. The servers for our site are stored in a physically secured and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to information on our servers via several user authentication technologies. Uproar will make every effort to protect the quality and integrity of personally identifiable information. However, Uproar cannot ensure the security of any information Members transmit to us. Members submit such information at their own risk and agree to absolve Uproar of any liability. Members are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their screen names, passwords and/or any other account information. 

12\. While Uproar is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on the Uproar Network. All third parties associated with Uproar (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. Uproar does not control this collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their independent policies or actions. 

13\. Any personal information voluntarily disclosed by Members and posted on our Web site, on message boards and/or in chat areas may be viewed and used by others. If Members post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the Member does so at his or her own risk. Members accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. 

14\. You may cancel your Uproar membership at any time. If for any reason you no longer want to be a registered Uproar Member, please send an e-mail to _memberservices@uproar.com_ with your request. 

15\. We will keep you informed about changes in our Privacy Policy. Please check this space regularly for any changes.
