# iwin.com - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy Terms & Conditions**  
Please read these terms and conditions carefully before using the iwin.com site. By using this site, you signify your assent to these terms and conditions. If you do not agree, please do not use this site. iwin.com maintains this site for your personal entertainment and makes every effort to protect your privacy as outlined in this privacy statement. Please feel free to browse the site and download the material for non-commercial, personal use. You may not, distribute, modify, or use the content of the site for public or commercial purposes. 

**Does iwin.com ask for personal information?**  
Yes, we do. iwin.com asks for your name, e-mail address, and other personal information when you register to qualify to win contests or other promotions sponsored by iwin.com and/or our partners.

**How does iwin.com use my personal information?**  
iwin.com's goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the most personalized web experience possible and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. By knowing a little about you, iwin.com is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you. In our role of delivering targeted advertisements, iwin.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, females over 24 years old). iwin.com takes the ad and displays it to users meeting those criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information but may receive aggregate information that illustrates consumer use patterns and trends. Only iwin.com has access to individuals' accounts. Telephone numbers and e-mail addresses will only be used to contact you regarding winning a game or contest or possible changes in game format. 

**Will iwin.com disclose any of my personal information?**  
iwin.com will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of iwin.com. 

**What about children?**  
The safety of children is very important to us. Children should always ask parents for permission before sending personal information to iwin.com, or to anyone online for that matter. Parents, please keep in mind that the personal information we gather from children aged 13 to 18 is used for editorial and feedback purposes, or for other lawful purposes specifically described when the information is collected. Any promotions we conduct, unless otherwise noted, are open to children 13 years and older. In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Act and the regulations promulgated by the Federal Communication Commission, children under the age of 13 are not allowed to use our site or win promotions, and we do not collect information from such childern. 

**Does iwin.com use cookies and IP Addresses?**  
Yes, cookies are used in iwin.com in a simplified format and ways. (1) We use cookies to be reminded of who you are and to help us to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to keep track of your iCoins and to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. This cookie is set when you register or "Log In" and is erased when you "Log Out" of our site. iwin.com may use cookies in the near future to store your Zip Code for other games, contests, and services that may require further tracking of scores and points earned and future services requiring such. (2) Cookies may in the future be used in iwin.com applications to help us, or certain merchants, track visits to, and business at, their web sites. The information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstrack" or other "names" data and may also describe where you've been on each web site. (3) Cookies are also used to estimate our audience size. Each browser accessing iwin.com may be given a unique cookie which is then used to determine repeat usage versus initial usage, and to help in targeting ads based on user interests. (4) Advertising networks that serve ads onto iwin.com may also use cookies.

**What else should I know about my privacy?**  
Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online - for example on message boards, through e-mail, or in chat areas - that information can be collected and used by others. In short, if you post personal information online that is accessible to the public, you may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. While we strive to protect your personal information, iwin.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. In addition, iwin.com and third party Internet sites and services accessible through iwin.com or iwin affiliate partners have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. iwin.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. You are solely responsible whenever you're online. Please note that once an account is created, we will send you a confirmation e-mail acknowledging your new account to the address that you supplied us. This e-mail will give you the option to delete your account, in case you change your mind or in case you were not the one who created it in the first place. You should keep the confirmation e-mail, as it will also contain information that will help you in case you run into problems accessing our services.

**Security**  
This site employs strict security measures that protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information under our control. Access to data is limited and strictly enforced. iwin.com periodically reviews each and every security policy to ensure privacy. Registration data is never sent over the Internet.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us at the point where we request information about the visitor. This site gives users options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service.
