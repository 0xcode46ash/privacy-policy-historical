# iWin Privacy Policy

Your privacy on the Internet is important to iWin. As part of the operation of iWin.com, certain information is gathered about those who visit iWin.com's Web site ("Users") and/or who register on iWin.com's Web site ("Members"). Below are explanations regarding the type of information collected, what is done with that information, and how to correct or change it.

BY REGISTERING THROUGH iWin.COM OR ANY OF ITS PARTNERS, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THE PRACTICES DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY, YOU MUST NOT REGISTER, OR, IF YOU ARE ALREADY REGISTERED, YOU MUST END YOUR MEMBERSHIP.

## Collected Information

### Required Information

As part of the iWin.com registration process, a Member may be asked to provide his or her name, e-mail address, postal address, telephone number, birth date, user name (or player name), password, and gender. We use this information to send Members their winnings, confirm their credit card information and determine whether the jurisdiction of their residence allows them to play games for real money.

### Use of Information

iWin.com uses information to deliver the iWin.com services. Thus, Member Information is used by iWin.com in identifying information that may be of interest to its Members. A Member's e-mail address will be used by iWin.com to contact that Member about Member-selected interests.

The "Refer A Friend" option authorizes us to send an email to friends. Those friends will not receive any other e-mail from iWin.com not relating to that promotion. In addition, iWin.com also reserves the right to use the information collected to occasionally notify our Members about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services, promotions, prizes, sponsor offers, and special offers.

Members may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional emails from iWin.com by following the "unsubscribe" instructions included with every iWin.com email.

By registering for an account, Members agree that iWin.com may display their player name and tournament records.

### Confidentiality

iWin.com reserves the right to use information volunteered by our users: (1) for the specific purposes for which such information was provided; (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, Members should note that iWin.com may change this Policy at any time, and that therefore iWin.com may in the future use some information for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy.

As provided in the User Agreement, Members are required to provide their personally identifiable information to iWin.com as a condition of Membership, and to understand and agree that iWin.com may share their personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties. If users do not provide the required personally identifiable information or do not agree that iWin.com may share their personally identifiable information with such entities, then they may not register as a Member, and if they are already a Member, they must immediately terminate their account.

Additionally, iWin.com may share Member information in aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to reach a particular Member target audience (e.g., registered single male Members between the ages of 27-45, who have an average household income of over $150,000.00). This information will allow these entities to provide relevant offers to specific Members.

Finally, iWin.com may disclose Member personally identifiable information in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property of iWin.com, or other Members of this Site.

By registering and using this Site, Members acknowledge that the processing of their personally identifiable information for the purposes described above may involve the transfer of such personally identifiable information from within the European Economic Area ("EEA") to countries outside the EEA whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union.

All iWin.com employees are required to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy provides that employees are obligated to keep Member information confidential. This obligation continues once an employee has left our Company.

### Use of Social Security Numbers

If a Member's total winnings on the Site in any given calendar year are greater than $600, iWin.com will request that he or she submit their social security number in order to send them a Form 1099, as required by Internal Revenue Service regulations. Failure to provide a valid social security number at that time will result in the Site's inability to credit their account for any winnings in excess of $600. Members take sole responsibility for paying any and all applicable taxes.

### Third Party Advertising, Cookies, and Clear GIFs

As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to our Members, iWin.com or its advertisers may use cookies, web beacons, and similar technologies to store and sometimes track non-personal information about Members while on the Web Site. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a Member's browser from a Web server and stored on a Member's computer hard drive. Areas of iWin.com's Web Site where Members are prompted to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. These technologies are also used to help iWin.com track the response to messages sent to Members on behalf of marketers so that iWin.com can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track response history and campaign effectiveness. In addition, banner advertisements are displayed on our Web Site which may contain cookies. While iWin.com uses cookies in other parts of our Web Site, the cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertising partners, and iWin.com does not have access to this information. Members may opt out of the advertising that they see on our site targeted specifically to them by going to the respective sites’ privacy policy(ies) and following directons. To opt out of Google’s “interest-based ads” and to learn more about Google’s collection of personal information to serve ads in connection with iWin.com, please go to www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/. With respect to cookies, users have a choice. By modifying their browser preferences, they have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If they choose to reject all cookies, they will be unable to use those iWin.com services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. iWin.com also uses a common technology known as a clear gif or action tags on the Web Site and in e-mail communications with Members. A clear gif (standing for "graphic interface format") is a small graphic image that is 1x1 pixel that iWin.com or one of its Partners places on a page of the Web Site. iWin.com may also occasionally place clear gifs in e-mail messages that it sends to Members. Clear gifs provide iWin.com with important information about how Members use the Web Site and respond to e-mail messages. This helps iWin.com to better track certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of its outreach to Members. iWin.com may also allow its advertisers and Partners the ability to use clear gifs on the Web Site solely to track Members who link from their respective sites to this Site, though this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to any Member's personal information to which they are not otherwise entitled. 

### Changing User Information

To change, update, or delete any information in a Member Account click the "My Profile" tab, or select "Account" and then "My Profile" from inside one of our Lobby applets.

### Children's Online Privacy Protection

The safety of children is important to us. iWin.com's Web Site is a general audience site that is not directed to children under the age of 18. Similarly, iWin.com's services are not directed to or intended for anyone under the age of 18. iWin.com will not knowingly accept Members who are under the age of 18 years nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from or about anyone under the age of 18 years. iWin.com relies on the truthfulness of the registration when accepting new Members. In the event that iWin.com receives information that establishes that a Member is under the age of 18 years, iWin.com reserves the right, but not the obligation, to terminate that Member's membership or take other steps that it determines are appropriate in the circumstances, such as providing parental notification. iWin.com may also delete all information in our databases about that terminated Member. 

### Sale or Acquisition of iWin.com

Notwithstanding anything in this Privacy Policy to contrary, we may, and all users authorize us to, disclose their personally identifiable information to an entity which purchases or acquires all or a substantially part of iWin.com's assets, or all or a substantial part of iWin.com's Web Site operations.

### Protection of Member Information and Credit Card Processing

iWin.com undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual Members and will not knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside iWin.com other than to the Member or as described in this Privacy Policy. iWin.com has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the iWin.com Web Site, including the confidentiality of information collected about iWin.com Members. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol.

Users should also do their part in protecting their own information. A iWin.com user name and password are confidential and we recommend that they not be divulged to anyone. Unfortunately, neither iWin.com's Web Site nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect Member information, iWin.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of Member information. Thus, any information a Member transmits to us is done so at the Member's own risk. Once we receive Member information, iWin.com undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Privacy Policy. A Member's information may be stored, processed and transferred to or from the United States or any other country where iWin.com, its Partners, affiliates or agents are located.

When a user enters credit card information and this information is being processed iWin.com uses a secure server, and the secure server software (SSL) encrypts the information they input.

### Policy Changes

The foregoing policy is effective as of October 2004. iWin.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. The continued use of iWin.com's services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean those changes have been accepted. For more information, see our User Agreement.

In the event that this document conflicts in any way with the User Agreement, the User Agreement shall take precedence over the relationship.
