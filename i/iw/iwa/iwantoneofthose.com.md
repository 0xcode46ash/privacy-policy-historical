Privacy Policy

##### What information we hold about you 

If you have bought something from us we will have your email address, phone number, address and credit card details. If you choose to deliver items to a third-party (such as a friend) we will have their name and address. Information is only used to help us deliver the parcels and contact you. You may also optionally decide to receive our newsletter and special offers. You can opt-out of this at any time by using 'My Account'. 

We also maintain an order history of your purchases. This allows you and us to track your deliveries and review your past purchases. We may offer you a reward for purchases or make an offer we think you might like based on your order history. We also collect information of a general nature about how many 'hits' our website gets. And we monitor the site traffic patterns; this tells us which areas of the site are being visited more than others. It also helps us build a more useful site in subsequent re-designs. We don't track individual users pathways through the site. Our site also uses 'cookies'.

##### Cookies

Cookies are small amounts of data sent to your web browser by a webserver. They cannot harm your machine in any way as they are small textfiles with simple information in them. You can see them as small textfiles inside your 'Temporary Internet Files' folder in Windows. Our cookies keep track of the items in your shopping basket and act as place markers when you move around the site. We also use software to track general browsing behaviour on our website. This means that we can build up a picture of the most popular areas and paths through the site and any problem areas, though we don't use it on a personal level to track individuals and their behaviour.

You may experience problems with our site when you try to buy items. These are usually to do with how you have set up your security settings in your web browser.

If you have set your Security Settings in Internet Explorer to 'high' you have disabled cookies. Our site uses cookies to provide some features such as the Shopping Cart and My Account. To use the site you will need to set the security level for the internet to Medium (under Tools/Internet Options). This is for "Safe browsing but still functional". Alternatively you can add www. iwantoneofthose.com to your list of trusted sites. Should you wish to turn off cookies in your browser, your browser's help menu should tell you how to do this, but this will, of course, affect some of the features of our site and therefore your shopping experience.

If you are worried about anything to do with our site, please phone us on 0844 573 7070 and we'll be glad to talk through any issues with you.

##### What we do with your information

In addition to processing your order, we also maintain an order history of your purchases. This allows you and us to track your deliveries and review your past purchases. We may offer you a reward for purchases or make an offer we think you might like based on your order history. We also send out a monthly email newsletter and the occasional 'Minimail'. These are only emailed to you if you have entered the website '\Â£1000 of stuff' competition, or if you have opted in to receive newsletters at the point of payment for your order.

If you don't want to receive these offers, or our occasional newsletter, simply send your email name to: [unsubscribe@iwantoneofthose.com](mailto:unsubscribe@iwantoneofthose.com).

Alternatively you can change newsletter settings from your 'My Account' page. We NEVER exchange, sell or otherwise give away your email address to other companies. Your email address is used solely by yourself, for purposes of logging into your account, and us for emailing you regarding your orders and to update you with our newsletter. We may, however, on occasion exchange your home address information with well-reputed third parties. By 'well-reputed' we mean people who respect any catalogue 'unsubscribe' requests and act on them immediately, should you not wish to hear from them again. If you don't want us to pass on your personal information simply send your email address to [privacy@iwantoneofthose.com](mailto:privacy@iwantoneofthose.com) or let us know if you no longer wish to receive our catalogues.

We may also use Personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti fraud checks. Personal Information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.

Pricing Policy

"Always fair prices."

I Want One Of Those maintains an everyday savings pricing policy. We watch other retailers closely and maintain competitive pricing. The internet being the beast it is means that any Tom, Dick or Henrietta can set up a website in their back room and charge bargain basement/off the back of a lorry (guv) prices. Often they will have no stock, no returns policy, questionable security, no guarantees and of course poor customer service. I Want One Of Those strives to be open and honest, so we will never inflate our prices to set up an artificial 'sale' (a common - and illegal - retail practice).

It is inevitable in an open market like the internet that there will be some individuals selling some items cheaper than we do, and some selling them for more than we do, just as in the high street. We take great pride in offering a fast, efficient, friendly and secure shopping experience, with great products at fair prices. We encourage our customers to shop around, but are very pleased to welcome them back again and again.

VAT - Please note that as we're based in the UK, our site shows all prices inclusive of VAT. Registered website customers from countries where VAT is not applicable will not be charged VAT at the time of their order unless the order is being sent to a UK or EU address.
