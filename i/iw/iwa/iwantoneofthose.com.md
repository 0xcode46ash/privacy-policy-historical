##### What information we hold about you

If you have bought something from us we will have your email address, phone number, address and credit card details. If you choose to deliver items to a third-party (such as a friend) we will have their name and address. Information is only used to help us deliver the parcels and contact you. 

You may also optionally decide to receive our newsletter and special offers. You can opt-out of this at any time by using 'My Account'.

We also maintain an order history of your purchases. This allows you and us to track your deliveries and review your past purchases. We may offer you a reward for purchases or make an offer we think you might like based on your order history.

We also collect information of a general nature about how many 'hits' our website gets. And we monitor the site traffic patterns; this tells us which areas of the site are being visited more than others. It also helps us build a more useful site in subsequent re-designs. We don't track individual users pathways through the site. Our site also uses 'cookies'.

##### Cookies

Cookies are small amounts of data sent to your web browser by a web server. They cannot harm your machine in any way as they are small text files with simple information in them. You can see them as small text files inside your 'Temporary Internet Files' folder in Windows. Our cookies keep track of the items in your shopping basket and act as place markers when you move around the site. We also use software to track general browsing behaviour on our website. This means that we can build up a picture of the most popular areas and paths through the site and any problem areas, though we don't use it on a personal level to track individuals and their behaviour.

You may experience problems with our site when you try to buy items. These are usually to do with how you have set up your security settings in your web browser. 

If you have set your Security Settings in Internet Explorer to 'high' you have disabled cookies. Our site uses cookies to provide some features such as the Shopping Cart and My Account. To use the site you will need to set the security level for the internet to Medium (under Tools/Internet Options). This is for "Safe browsing but still functional". Alternatively you can add Iwantoneofthose.com to your list of trusted sites.

If you are worried about anything to do with our site, please phone us on 0870 241 1066 and we'll be glad to talk through any issues with you. If you wish to learn more about cookies - exactly what they are, how to manage them etc, you could take a look at this website - [www.allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/index.html).

##### What we do with your information

In addition to processing your order, we also maintain an order history of your purchases. This allows you and us to track your deliveries and review your past purchases. We may offer you a reward for purchases or make an offer we think you might like based on your order history. We also send out a monthly email newsletter and the occasional 'Minimail'. These are only emailed to you if you have entered the website 'Â£1000 of stuff' competition, or if you have opted in to receive newsletters at the point of payment for your order. 

If you don't want to receive these offers, or our occasional newsletter, simply send your email name to: [unsubscribe@iwantoneofthose.com](mailto:unsubscribe@iwantoneofthose.com). Alternatively you can change newsletter settings from your 'My Account' page. We NEVER exchange, sell or otherwise give away your email address to other companies. Your email address is used solely by yourself, for purposes of logging into your account, and us for emailing you regarding your orders and to update you with our newsletter. We may, however, on occasion exchange your home address information with well-reputed third parties for the purpose of catalogue mail-outs. By 'well-reputed' we mean people who respect any catalogue 'unsubscribe' requests and act on them immediately, should you not wish to hear from them again. If you don't want us to pass on your personal information simply send your email address to [privacy@iwantoneofthose.com](mailto:privacy@iwantoneofthose.com) or let us know if you no longer wish to receive our catalogues. 

##### Who else sees your information 

We may have to disclose some of your information to service suppliers to help complete your order. These parties include Royal Mail, Parcel Line, FedEx and TNT. 

##### Your Consent 

By using our web site you consent to us using the personal information you have given I Want One Of Those and our trusted partners, as outlined in this Privacy Policy. If you are worried about anything to do with our site, please phone us on 0870 241 1066 and we'll be glad to talk through any issues with you.
