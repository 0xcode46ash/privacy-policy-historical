We use this information to contact you about the services in which you have expressed interest, provide you with your login details, allow you to create invoices and shipments for your clients, to send you service related emails, and to allow you to track your packages until such time as they are de3livered to you. You have the ability to upload shipment files to make it easier for you to create your shipments. These are stored on our site for your own personal use.
