We are committed to protecting your privacy. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to other companies, except to the provider of your selected accommodation or trip. We use the information we collect about you to process your bookings with the relevant provider. 

In order to make a reservation through our website, you are required to provide your credit card details. These details are sent by a secured mode using 128 bit SSL encryption technology to the respective accommodation or trip provider to confirm the reservation. The payment is then either processed offline by the accommodation/trip provider or a deposit is charged by i-escape.com on behalf of the accommodation/trip provider. In the case of the latter, the secure server is separate to the server that runs this website and is maintained by Secure Hosting Limited. Secure Hosting Limited will hold all such information and only release it to i-escape.com (RTA) for any of the purposes set out below: 

1\. The use of this information by i-escape.com (RTA) in connection with the provision of i-escape.comâ€™s services to you as stated in these terms and conditions.   
2\. The release by i-escape.com (RTA) of this information to each hotel/service provider at the stage of the on-line confirmation by you of booking.   
3\. The notification to you by e-mail of marketing information including possible opportunities PROVIDED THAT you have not expressed a wish (by ticking the opt out box) not to be so provided with such information.   
4\. The notification to you by other means (e.g. direct mail) of similar marketing information (including marketing with Third Party Partners) PROVIDED THAT you have expressed a wish (by ticking the opt in box) to be so provided with such information. 

Secure transactions can be identified by the presence of a closed lock in most browsers. We also employ security measures to protect your information from access by unauthorised persons and against unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction and damage. We will retain your information for a reasonable period or as long as the law requires.
