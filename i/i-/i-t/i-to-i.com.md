# i-to-i privacy policy

In this Information Age, you need to know how information about you is gathered and used on the Internet. At i-to-i, we take your privacy seriously and do all we can to protect it. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect and use information about you as you utilize i-to-i and i-to-i partner sites. Our Privacy Policy is subject to change, so we encourage you to visit this page occasionally for more information. 

## Why we collect personal information 

First and foremost, i-to-i collects personal information to personalize your experience with our site. The more we know about you, the more we can present you with information and features that will interest you. 

We also use user information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate they site. By collecting information, we can also see the number of entries in i-to-i promotions and contents. The information we collect enables us to contact users with offers and advertisements that may appeal to them. At times, we may also use the information we collect to notify users of site updates and to promote special events at i-to-i. 

## How we gather data on i-to-i users

Sometimes, we simply ask you to provide your name, e-mail address, post code, and country. Whenever you give this kind of information, it helps us to tailor our content for you. 

At other times – such as when you buy i-Ventures or TEFL courses, enter i-to-i promotions, or answer surveys on our site – we may ask for more detailed personal information. For instance, when you make a purchase through i-to-i, we collect your billing address, telephone number, credit card information, and other information necessary to complete the transaction. 

Wherever we ask you for personal information, we include a link to this Privacy Policy for your review. 

## Other companies’ access to your personal information

i-to-i does not sell, rent or trade user information to other companies, unless otherwise stated. Our site may link to sites that collect personally identifiable information about you when you access them from i-to-i. This type of collection or use of personal information is beyond i-to-i’s control and is not covered by this Privacy Policy. 

We may occasionally need to share your information with business partners who co-sponsor competitions or other services. In these cases, we will provide only the data that is needed to make the service or contest successful, but will remain i-to-i’s sole property. If you do not want i-to-i to share your information, simply choose not to allow the transfer by not using or signing up for the competition in question. 

We may also share your information with partners with whom we have co-branded sites and co-branded data collection. 

Lastly, when you purchase an item through our online shop or sign up to receive promotional items from us, we may need to share some personal information with the third parties helping us to complete your transaction or send you the items you have requested. When we share your information with such third parties, we will disclose only the information needed to complete your transaction. 

## Security

i-to-i stores all data behind carefully selected security devices, such as firewalls. All internal communication with the system and communication of private member data, such as credit card information, is transmitted using encrypted protocols. Once the transaction is complete, the card details are not stored. Policies related to staff access to private member data are in place. All data is held in the strictest confidence, protected by the strictest security standards.
