# Privacy Policy

Privacy Policy
In this Information Age, you need to know how information about you is gathered and used on the
Internet. At i-to-i, we take your privacy seriously and do all we can to protect it. This Privacy Policy
explains how we collect and use information about you as you utilise i-to-i. Our Privacy Policy is subject to
change, so we encourage you to visit this page occasionally for more information.
Why We Collect Personal Information
First and foremost, i-to-i collects personal information to personalise your experience with our site. The
more we know about you, the more we can present you with information and features that will interest
you.
We also use user information to measure our success and performance. For example, aggregate
information gives us an idea of the number of visitors we attract and how they navigate they site. By
collecting information, we can also figure the number of entries in i-to-i promotions and contents. The
information we collect enables us to contact users with offers and advertisements that may appeal to
them. At times, we may also use the information we collect to notify users of site updates and to promote
special events at i-to-i.
How We Gather Data on i-to-i Users
We gather information in a number of ways, depending on the section you are using within i-to-i.
Sometimes, we simply ask you to provide your name, e-mail address, zip code, and country. Whenever
you give this kind of information, it helps us to tailor our content for you.
At other times – such as when you buy i-Ventures or TEFL courses, enter i-to-i promotions, or answer
surveys on our site – we may ask for more detailed personal information. For instance, when you make a
purchase through i-to-i, we collect your billing address, telephone number, credit card information, and
other information necessary to complete the transaction.
Wherever we ask you for personal information, we try to include a link to this Privacy Policy for your
review.
Cookies
Cookies are not used explicitly on the i-to-i web site. However, the web site does use session variables,
which are treated as if they were cookies by a browser. As their name suggests, these variables expire
once a session has ended. On the i-to-i web site, session variables are used to deliver browser-specific
content during an individual session, e.g. the news ticker for Internet Explorer users. Also, certain
information is stored temporarily in session variables during the booking process. This information is not
retained in cookie form once a user's session has ended.
Other Companies’ Access to Your Personal Information
i-to-i does not sell, rent or trade user information to other companies. Our site may link to sites that collect
personally identifiable information about you when you access them from i-to-i. This type of collection or
use of personal information is beyond i-to-i’s control and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
We may occasionally need to share your information with business partners who co-sponsor competitions
or other services. In these cases, we will provide only the data that is needed to make the service or
contest successful. If we plan to share this type of information, we will notify you before we collect it. If
you do not want i-to-i to share your information, simply choose not to allow the transfer by not using or
signing up for the competition in question.
When you purchase an item through our online shop or sign up to receive promotional items from us, we
may need to share some personal information with the third parties helping us to complete your
transaction or send you the items you have requested. When we share your information with such third
parties, we will disclose only the information needed to complete your transaction.


Security
i-to-i stores all data behind carefully selected security devices, such as firewalls. All internal
communication with the system and communication of private member data, such as credit card
information, is transmitted using encrypted protocols. Policies related to staff access to private member
data are in place. All data is held in the strictest confidence, protected by the strictest security standards.

as outlined in this Privacy Policy.
