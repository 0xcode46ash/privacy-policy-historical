# Privacy Policy - I-Dressup

**Privacy policy**

**What Information is collected?**

We collect personal information when you register for our membersâ€™ club or otherwise voluntarily provide such information. We may combine personal information collected from you with information from other Google services or third parties to provide a better user experience, including customizing content for you. 

Our server automatically record information when you visit our website or use some of our products, including the URL, IP address, browser type and language, and the date and time of your request. 

We maintain log files which contain IP addresses. An IP address is a numeric address that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. We do not link IP addresses to personal information. In general, we only use log files to monitor traffic on our Web sites and to troubleshoot technical problems. In the event of abuse, however, we may block certain IP addresses. 

**How do we use the information?**

We may use personal information to provide the services you've requested, including services that display customized content and advertising. 

We may also use personal information for auditing, research and analysis to operate and improve our services. 

We may share aggregated non-personal information with third parties. 

When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. 

**Email Correspondence**

We may respond to email sent directly to us or through a online submission form. The sender's e-mail address is not shared with third parties and would only rarely be used for one time correspondence with that user. These e-mails are kept internally for our own day to day business purposes. 

We do not maintain e-mail lists nor market via e-mail. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Links to Other Sites**

Links to other sites are operated independently and out of our control. We recommend you not share personal information on other sites unless you view their privacy policy.
