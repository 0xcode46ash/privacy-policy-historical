iQU is a trade name owned and used by iQU Online B.V., a private limited liability company incorporated under Dutch law, having its registered office at Stationsplein 112 in (2011 LN) Haarlem, the Netherlands, listed in the Commercial Register of the Chamber of Commerce under number 65014405. We take your privacy very seriously. We will therefore observe due care in handling your data. In this Privacy Policy, we explain what data it collects for what purpose and how we further process those data. The Privacy Policy applies to the websites and/or applications made available by iQU (collectively referred to below as "the Websites"), such as [www.iqu.com]. Specific solutions might have different privacy policies that apply to these services.

**Website Visitors**

When you visit the Websites and use our services, you agree that iQU, may process your anonymous or personal data in the manner described in this Privacy Policy. iQU processes your personally-identifying information to deliver the services IQU provides according to the principles laid down in this Privacy Policy.

Except as described below, iQU does not collect or require visitors to its Websites to furnish personally-identifying information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers. Only if you apply for the newsletter as opt-in you give iQU permission to use your e-mail address for our newsletter. Like most website operators, iQU does collect non-personally-identifying information that web browsers and servers typically make available, which are the browser type, language preference, referring site, and date and time of each visitor request. iQU also collects potentially-personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally-identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.

iQU's purpose in collecting this information is to better understand how iQU's visitors use its Websites. To that end, iQU may share potentially-personally-identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations. iQU may also release non-personally-identifying information about visitors (e.g., by publishing a report on Web site usage trends). Otherwise, iQU will not publicly release potentially-personally-identifying information except under the same circumstances as iQU releases personally-identifying information. Those circumstances are explained below.

**Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information**

Where iQU has collected personally-identifying information, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries, that need to know that information in order to process it on iQU's behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using iQU's Websites, you consent to the transfer of your information to other countries, such as the United States, which may provide a different level of data protection than your home country. iQU does not rent or sell such information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations, as described above, iQU discloses such information only when required to do so by law, or when iQU believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of iQU, third party (such as right holders of intellectual property rights) or the public at large. iQU takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of such information.

**Updating of Personally-Identifying Information**

iQU permits users to freely review, update, correct, and suppress their personally-identifying information as maintained by iQU. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on whichever iQU Websites store the relevant information. Users have the right to ask to review, correct, as well as delete their personally-identifying information stored in web applications managed by IQU by contacting info@iqu.com.

**Cookies and Tracking Pixels**

**What Are Cookies?**

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, mobile phone or tablet, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Most websites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to "recognize" a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in iQU cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with iQU and, where applicable, its third-party service provider.

**What Are Tracking Pixels?**

Tracking pixels (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help web site operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A tracking pixel is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) or a script that is placed on a site. The use of a tracking pixel allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the tracking pixel. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a Web site.

**How We Use Cookies and Tracking Pixels.**

iQU's websites use cookies to help iQU identify and track visitors, their usage of iQU websites, and their website access preferences across multiple requests and visits to iQU's websites. The websites, and advertisements that iQU may run occasionally on third-party advertising networks, also may use tracking pixels for these purposes. The basic idea is to gather data about how people use the iQU websites and as such to be able to optimize the Websites and the services. The term usually used to describe this is "web analytics" and the cookies and tracking pixels are the tools by which a website owner collects this web analytics data.

iQU will use the web analytics data only to determine usage patterns for our websites as described above. The iQU websites do this by using either its own internal analytics software or by sending this information to a third-party service provider to help iQU analyze this data and the iQU websites. iQU has agreements with its third-party service providers that they will not share this information with others or use the information for purposes other than to maintain the services they provide to iQU. It is possible to link cookies and tracking pixels to personally-identifying information, thereby permitting website operators, including our third-party analytics providers, to track the online movements of particular individuals. iQU's third-party service providers are not allowed to correlate iQU data with any other data.

iQU uses the information provided by cookies and tracking pixels to develop a better understanding of how iQU's visitors use iQU's Websites, and to facilitate those visitors' interactions with iQU's websites. iQU may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally-identifying information or potentially-personally-identifying information.

**How to Control the Use of Cookies.**

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. iQU visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by iQU, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to iQU's websites. Certain features of iQU's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

iQU may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on this page.

By using the websites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the websites. Any changes to this privacy policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised privacy policy on the websites. By using the websites following any changes, you accept the revised privacy policy then in effect.
