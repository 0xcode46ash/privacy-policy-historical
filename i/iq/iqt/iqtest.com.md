### Our Privacy Policy is Very Simple:

We will not sell, rent, or distribute your email address or any information we collect from you to any third party. All information that we collect is kept on our private servers and is used for internal purposes only.

We may contact you regarding special offers from IQTest.com or to let you know about new tests available on the site if you have checked the box in your personal settings requesting that we keep you up to date.

We use cookies to allow you to have a private account with us. Cookies are not used to collect personal information.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

### **Terms of Service:**

Although we will do everything in our power to store your results indefinitely, we make no guarantee that they will be available on the site. Sometimes the internet misbehaves.

Results are sent to the email address entered on the registration page immediately following the test. If your email address does not accept the email from IQTest.com, we are not responsible for that malfunction. 

We cannot guarantee that your score on the test at IQTest.com will be the same, or even close, to your score on any other test, and we cannot take responsibility for any dissatisfaction you may experience when you receive your score.

We are not responsible for data lost because of the malfunctioning of your computer or your internet connection.

Regards,

The Team at **IQTest.com**
