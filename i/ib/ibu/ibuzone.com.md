# Privacy & Policy

Many companies post a serious sounding privacy policy in order to give the appearance of exceeding trustworthiness. But when you actually stop and read the policy line by line (as if you didn't have better things to do with your life), you'll notice the cookie cutter template feel of the document you're perusing.

And then there's us. Welcome to the ibuzone.com privacy policy. A refreshing change to privacy: through openness.

Openness about what type of information we obtain from you.

Openness about what we do with that information.

Openness about how we keep your information safe.

Let's begin shall we?

Non Personal Information

First off we use Google Analytics to track our visitors. We do this so we can identify where visitors come from and what they do on our site while they're here. Primarily it helps us to continually refine the web experience that visitors receive when they come to [ibuzone.com](https://web.archive.org/ "ibuzone").

As a business of course, all such efforts are for the purposes of increasing sales and profitability, but we believe that the word "corporation" doesn't have to be synonymous with "greed and evil". In fact, our aim is to be the nicest company in the world. Even as it applies to privacy.

Back to our topic. Using Google Analytics results in small tag or text files if you will, called "cookies" to be stored on your computer. Cookies come in many different flavors. Some cookies indicate your preference settings. Others indicate when you last visited our site. For more information on this subject please visit:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie

Aside from cookies, our server logs also record your IP address, operating system, web browser, and other basic web details. Such details are generally considered "non personal information" as there is no way to tie that information to you the individual.

Personal Information

When you open an account with us, we ask for things like your name, street address, email address, and telephone number. This is pretty standard nowadays. But when you stop and think about it, this information is pretty personal. When you place an order with us, you'll probably provide us with your credit card information. Even more personal.

But we're not going to create an illusion of safety for you. We're not going to tell you that our offices are thirty levels underground in a top secret facility where no one can break in and steal your data. The fact is, our offices are in a upscale location in downtown Shenzhen, China. There is good building security and after hours, people are required to log in and out to enter the premises. And of course we have physical locks on our doors, on top of an electronic one with alarm. But then again, most companies do too.

Your data is stored on our servers locally and in the US. They are backed up regularly and the usual anti-hacking measures have been setup. But let's be honest. Some of the world's biggest companies have been hacked into at one time or another. Add to that the huge list of various government agencies around the world that have been hacked into as well, sometimes repeatedly, and you arrive at a cold harsh reality: the term "Internet security" is an oxymoron at the best of times.

Therefore, perhaps it would be useful to see shopping at [ibuzone.com](https://web.archive.org/ "ibuzone") like this:

If you're worried about internet security, please refrain from shopping online. You could take the kids to Wal-mart, stopover at McDonald's, and make a day of shopping. But if you feel that the benefits of online shopping outweigh the hazards, then we ask that you please shop here where you'll enjoy an outstanding product variety, fair prices, and a great customer experience everytime.

And we try to hire the most trustworthy employees we can, but unless they invent a mind-reading machine it is impossible to know a person completely. We hire very carefully though. Our people must be trustworthy not only with our customer's info but our own. Corporate espionage is becoming more and more prevalent. And since we encourage a bff (best friends for life) culture here at [ibuzone.com](https://web.archive.org/ "ibuzone"), it really makes work more rewarding when you know you can trust the person sitting next to you. Demographically, most of our staff are university graduates who are more interested in the latest anime episodes and fashion, than doing bad things with our customer's data. They're well-educated, polite, and have a positive outlook on life.

And no, we don't sell your information to third parties for the purposes of marketing to you. There's a special place in Hell for people who do that. But we do share your information to some companies, ie courier companies would require your address so they can ship your products to you. We would share your information if a court order forced us to, but unless you're a mastermind criminal, what are the chances of that happening? Oh and if we ever get bought by another company (we don't see that happening in the foreseeable future), they would have access to your information.

And that's about it for privacy.
