#### Security

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information both online and offline. Any sensitive information submitted via the Web site is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access this information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

#### Phishing

Phishing is a term used to describe a type of Internet scam in which inauthentic e-mails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you. 

The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm

Please know that IBDeditorials.com takes the privacy of our users and members very seriously. If you are ever in question about the legitimacy of an e-mail from IBDeditorials.com, please contact customer service at: (800) 831-2525.
