# The Irritable Bowel Syndrome Self Help and Support Group Respects Your Privacy | IBSgroup.org

**Publication Date (revised): April 1, 2014**

IBS Self Help and Support Group ("IBS Group") respects your privacy. That's why we have created this Privacy Statement to explain how and why we collect certain information online, and how we use that information. This statement also explains how you can prevent collection of certain information about yourself, if you choose. Please take a few moments to read our Privacy Statement. This statement applies to both information we collect from visitors to the IBSGroup.org Web site, as well as information we collect or have access to when on our message boards.

**Right to Change Policy**  
As IBS Group is constantly innovating and enhancing the forums and services it provides to its users, this Privacy Statement will also continue to change to match the forums and services we make available. As such, we reserve the right to change this statement to match the forums and services we provide. If we make any material change to this statement, we will change the date at the top of this statement to reflect the effective date of the change. When you visit our site or use our forums and services, we encourage you to check the date of this Privacy Statement to ensure you are aware of any updates.

However, regardless of how this Privacy Statement may change or evolve over time, IBS Group will not collect or maintain your private and personally identifiable information without your consent. Further, if you consent to give us your personal information, we will keep it confidential and will not sell, license or disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent, unless we are compelled to do so under the law or to comply with a court order.

If you opt-out of our mailing list we may privately share your email address with a third party so that the 3rd party may separately opt you out of their list.
