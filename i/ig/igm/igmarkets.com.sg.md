# Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. This statement outlines our policy on how we manage the personal information we hold about our customers, shareholders and others. It applies to IG Asia Pte Ltd and all organisations within the IG group of companies.

It is our policy to respect the confidentiality of information and the privacy of individuals.

Our Privacy Policy Statement will be reviewed from time to time to take account of new laws and technology, changes to our operations and practices and to make sure it remains appropriate to the changing environment. Any information we hold will be governed by our most current Privacy Policy Statement.

####  Why do we collect personal information?

Our business is to meet our customers' needs for a range of financial services. To do this effectively, we need to collect certain personal information.

####  What kind of personal information do we ask for?

The type of personal information we may collect can include (but is not limited to) name, address, date of birth, contact details, income, assets and liabilities, account balances, trading statements, tax, financial statements, education, past trading experience and employment details.

We obtain most of the information directly from our customers through application or other forms, and from maintaining records of information provided in the course of ongoing customer service. We may also obtain information from other sources.

We may collect personal information you enter when using our website and also obtain personal information from other sources.

We may ask for other information voluntarily from time to time (for example, through market research, surveys or special offers) to enable us to improve our service or consider the wider needs of our customers or potential customers.

If you choose not to provide the information we need to fulfil your request for a specific product or service, we may not be able to provide you with the requested product or service.

####  How do we use this information and who may we disclose it to?

While we may send you marketing material from time to time that we think will be useful to you, we are conscious of the need to respect your privacy.

Unless you are informed otherwise, the personal information we hold is used for establishing and managing your account, reviewing your ongoing needs, enhancing customer service and products and giving you ongoing information or opportunities that we believe may be relevant to you.

Depending on the product or service concerned and particular restrictions on sensitive information, this means that personal information may be disclosed to:

  * Government bodies, when required by law and to regulatory authorities or exchanges that have jurisdictions over us or the transactions in your account with us
  * other companies within the IG group who provide financial and other services
  * service providers and specialist advisers who have been contracted to provide us with administrative, financial, insurance, research or other services
  * introducing brokers with whom we have a mutual relationship
  * credit providers, debt collection agencies, lawyers, courts and  tribunals and any such third parties to assist us in enforcing our legal or contractual rights against you
  * credit reporting or reference agencies
  * anyone authorised by an individual, as specified by that individual or the Customer Agreement



Generally, we require that organisations outside the IG group of companies who handle or obtain personal information as service providers acknowledge the confidentiality of this information, undertake to respect any individual's right to privacy and comply with this policy. Third party service providers may keep a record of any searches performed on our behalf and may use the search details to assist other companies in performing their searches. Please note that third parties are not covered by our privacy policy and are not subject to our privacy standards and procedures.
