Under the Act, you have the right to obtain a copy of any personal data which we hold about you and to advise us of any inaccuracy that requires a correction. In addition, you are entitled to know how your personal data has been used or disclosed in the past one year.

We hold personal data in a combination of secure computer storage facilities and paper-based files and other records, and take steps to protect the personal data we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

We may need to maintain records containing personal data for a significant period of time, as long as it is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected, or as required or permitted by applicable laws.

We shall cease to retain personal data, or remove the means by which the personal data can be associated with particular individuals, as soon as it is reasonable to assume that the purpose for which that personal data was collected is no longer being served by retention of the personal data and retention is no longer necessary for legal or business purposes.
