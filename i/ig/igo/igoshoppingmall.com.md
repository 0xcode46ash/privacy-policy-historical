# Global One | Privacy Policy

This web site is owned and operated by Global One Companies LLC, D.B.A. iGO Shopping Mall ("iGO"). iGO takes user privacy seriously and makes reasonable efforts to protect your privacy. We have created this Privacy Policy in order to share with you our information collection and use practices. Please read this policy carefully before sharing any personally identifiable information described below. 

## Information We Collect

Global One Companies LLC, D.B.A. iGO Shopping Mall ("iGO") requires relevant contact and other information in order to facilitate its service offerings. This generally includes your name and contact information such as e-mail and postal mail addresses. In the course of conducting its business, iGO compiles purchase information, such as the time of purchase, the retailer, and the purchase amount. iGO does not receive your credit card number or other personal information that you submit at our featured retailers’ websites. We receive only information regarding transactions so that we may credit purchases to your iGO account.

## How We Use Your Information

iGO may use or disclose personally identifiable information to operate and manage our website, to track shopper activity, to provide services that you have requested or authorized, and to respond to your inquires or requests. We may also disclose personally identifiable information in the establishment or exercise of legal rights or defense against legal claims, to comply with applicable laws or regulations, to comply with a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena or court order, or to investigate suspected fraud or a violation of the terms of the iGO Program [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/a/growteamfast/shop/terms). We will not sell your personally identifiable information to a third party not affiliated with iGO, except in connection with the sale or merger of iGO or the division responsible for such services. We may use and disclose non-personally identifiable information for any number of reasons, including but not limited to, working with business partners and improving our services.

## Security

The security of your personally identifiable information is very important to us and we take steps to attempt to secure your personally identifiable information. We have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. However, due to the inherent open nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and iGO or information stored or transmitted through our website or on our servers, will be completely free from unauthorized access by third parties such as hackers, and your use of our website and/or services demonstrates your assumption of this risk.

## What Are Cookies?

Cookies are small text files that a website sends to your web browser. The next time your browser requests information from the website, it sends the information in the cookie back to that website. Cookies are frequently used to keep track of how many times a user visits a site and to enhance a visitor’s experience. For instance, some websites use cookies to recognize you when you return and customize your visit. iGO uses cookies to recognize you upon return so that we may restore certain features, such as the retailers you select as your favorites. We also use cookies to allow you to shop and receive credit without having to log in each time you visit iGO. This is provided as a convenience for our members. You may stop or restrict the placement of cookies on your computer or flush them from your browser by adjusting your web browser preferences, but this may interfere with some of our website functionality.

Our featured retailers use cookies to track visits to iGO and to track purchases made by iGO visitors, thereby ensuring that iGO is properly credited. This then allows us to credit our members and it is why cookies should be enabled when using iGO. Cookies that are set by affiliated retailers when you visit iGO are known as “third-party cookies”, since they are not set directly by the site you are visiting iGO. Cookies that are set by a retailer can only be seen by that retailer. So, for instance, a retailer cannot see another retailer’s cookies, nor can a retailer see the cookies that iGO sets.

## Featured Retailers’ Privacy Policies

When you shop through iGO, you are redirected to the websites of our featured retailers, where privacy policies may differ from those of iGO. We are not responsible for the privacy policies of our featured retailers, and we encourage you to understand the privacy policies of any websites to which you submit your personal information.

## Changes in Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time. iGO will post those changes on this page. The version of this Privacy Policy posted to the iGO Shopping Mall web site at [http://igoshoppingmall.com/a/growteamfast/shop/privacy](https://web.archive.org/a/growteamfast/shop/privacy) supersedes all other versions of the site Privacy Policy, written or electronic.
