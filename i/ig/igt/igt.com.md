# IGT - Privacy Policy

## Privacy is very important to IGT

It is the policy of International Game Technology ("IGT") to respect the privacy of users who visit IGT.com or any of the other IGT Web sites (each a "Site"). To ensure this, the following policy statement explains how we collect information from you as well as how it is used.

This information may include, among other things, URL tracking information, user's browser, user's IP address, files downloaded or viewed by the user and user's path through the Web site, date, time and frequency of accessing site and length of time spent reviewing certain features. We may also track usage through cookies. A cookie is a small data file written to a user's hard drive. Cookies may be used to, among other things, allow automated log-in and may contain information such as a login ID or other information about preferences or Internet use. If you wish to disable cookies, you may do so on your Web browser.

## Personal Identifying Information

We may collect your name, address, telephone number(s), e-mail address when you provide us with that information, when you request information from us, contact us, or sign up for classes with us. We may also collect information about your job history and experience, and your education when you submit your application for employment with IGT or our subsidiaries or affiliates on or through our Site. We may also ask you for other information to help us determine whether you would be eligible under various local immigration or employment laws to work in a particular country.

IGT uses the information we collect on the Site to respond to your requests for information or questions, to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to statistically analyze usage of our Site, to improve our content and offerings on the Site, to improve and evaluate our products and services, and to customize the content and layout of the Site.

We may use e-mail addresses, mailing addresses or phone numbers, to contact users regarding administrative notices and for the purposes of promoting IGTÂ® products or services and the Site. Should you wish to be removed from IGT's electronic communications list at any time, please send your request to: [MemberServices@IGT.com](mailto:MemberServices@IGT.com?subject=Member%20Account%20Update).

If you are applying from outside of the United States, your information will be transferred to the United States for consideration.

## International Users

This Site is hosted on a server in the United States and all information collected by IGT from this Site will be collected, stored, used and otherwise processed in the United States, including information from users outside the United States. By accessing this Site you consent to the transfer to and use of your information in the United States in accordance with this Policy.

## Disclosure to Third Parties

IGT is not in the business of selling personally identifiable information to others. IGT does or may share or disclose information you provide us to other companies and people with your consent or under the circumstances described below.

IGT may analyze or disclose aggregated information that does not identify our users to third parties for marketing and promotional or other purposes.

We also share user information with our subsidiaries, affiliates, business partners and service providers. These third parties may provide you information, products, or services on our behalf or to help us provide our customers with better products and services.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if all or substantially all the assets of IGT or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates assets were acquired, user information would be one of the transferred assets. We do not offer for sale personally identifiable information other than in connection with business-related transfers.

IGT reserves the right to disclose user or visitor information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) IGT's rights or property, other users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. IGT may also disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

## Children

The Site is generally not intended for use by children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any personal information about children under the age of 13 or market to them.

## Security

IGT uses reasonable security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of information that it collects. IGT limits access to such information to authorized personnel only.

## General

IGT cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our site for illegal activities. Therefore, IGT responds to subpoenas, warrants or other court orders regarding information concerning any users. We will, at our discretion, disclose information if we believe we are required to do so by law, believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect us from legal liability or believe we need to do so to protect someone's safety or the integrity of the site.
