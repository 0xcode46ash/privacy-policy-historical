# iGive Privacy

First and foremost, we respect your right to privacy. We will never sell or share your name, cause affiliation, e-mail address, preferences, shop.igive purchase information, site activity or other personally identifiable information to or with any third party, ever, without your consent or court order.

We will be utilizing your e-mail address to send you our newsletters and to alert you to special opportunities and offers available only to iGive members. As a member, you may opt out of receiving the newsletter, or any correspondence from iGive at any time.

| 

We will disclose information that we gather only in the aggregate in order to analyze our usage and attract advertisers, corporate sponsors or merchant affiliates.  
   
  
 

| 

We will take great care and caution to keep whatever information we gather safe. Our servers are all password protected, inside locked facilities.  
   
  
 

| 

We will actively disclose to our members the kinds and quantities of information that we are gathering.

We do not share this information with others.

We and certain of our vendors use ‘cookies' to make visiting our site a better, easier experience. These cookies allow us or our vendors to recognize you when you visit iGive and the iGive Mall. They also make it easier for us to track your activity and purchases and to match them with your member registration and charity so that you receive the appropriate credit.

Please note that when a member shops at our advertisers or in the shop.igive mall, they are dealing with another company, not iGive. This means that you enter into a relationship with that company/web site separately from iGive. Any information you share with that advertiser or merchant is subject to their policies and practices, not to iGive's policies or practices. Members are encouraged to read the privacy policies of our merchant partners.

We track of IP addresses and other information that may identify an individual.
