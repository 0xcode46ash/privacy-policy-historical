Who Is IGIGI? (ee zhee zhee)   
IGIGI specializes in sexy and sophisticated [plus size dresses](http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-clothing/Plus-Size-Dresses.html), [plus size clothing](http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-clothing/Plus-Size-All-Products.html), [plus size evening wear](http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-clothing/Plus-Size-Evening-Dresses.html), [plus size tops](http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-clothing/Plus-Size-Tops.html), and [plus size pants and skirts](http://www.igigi.com/plus-size-clothing/Plus-Size-Bottoms.html).  
We believe that words like "ample," "opulent," "curvaceous," and "voluptuous" should be mainstays in the fashion dictionary.  
It is important to accentuate and celebrate the beauty and sensuality of the female figure rather than cover it up with piles of fabric.
