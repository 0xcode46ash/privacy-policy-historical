It’s Nice That uses cookies, which amongst other things, help us to improve your experience of our website and to ensure that it performs as you expect it. Cookies are text files containing small pieces of information which are downloaded to your computer or mobile device. They can improve your experience of using a website, for example, by remembering your preference setting and tracking your use of a website so that it can be improved to meet your needs. They can also ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.

We use…  
The information below explains what cookies we use on It’s Nice That, why we use them and where they come from. We also state in the table whether a cookie is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. The difference is that:

For example, where a “persistent cookie” is used on a website to remember your log-in details, you will not need to enter those details each time you visit that website.
  * Session cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when you open the browser window and finishes when you close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted.
