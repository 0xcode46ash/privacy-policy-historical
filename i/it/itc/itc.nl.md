# ITC - Privacy policy

_This Privacy Policy discloses the privacy practices for Itc.nl and its subdomains. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, unless otherwise noted, all references to "Itc.nl " include subdomains._

**What information does  ITC gather about you?  
**ITC collects information from you when you access Itc.nl, when you subscribe to our email service, and when you apply for one of our courses.

**What does ITC use your information for?  
** ITC uses your IP address to administer its website by identifying (1) which parts of our site are most heavily used, and (2) which portion of our audience comes from within the ITC network. ITC does not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that user sessions will be tracked, but the users will remain anonymous.

The information you provide when you apply for one of ITC's courses may be used for registration for the purpose of education, Visa and insurance application, and to respond to inquiries, and/or other requests made by you.

The email address you provide may be used to send you information and to respond to inquiries, requests or questions.

ITC may contract service providers to process your personal data, whose activities will be solely restricted to processing data at the behest and on behalf of ITC. ITC will not provide your data to third parties for any other reason, except where required to do so by law.

**Device Information Collected By ITC  
** ITC may collect non-personal information about the computer, mobile device or other device you use to access Itc.nl, such as IP address, geolocation information, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language or other information of this nature. ITC uses this information in an aggregate fashion to track access to Itc.nl. At no time does ITC disclose site usage by individual IP addresses. 

**Cookies  
** Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer (unless you block them). ITC uses cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. 

**Third-Party Cookies  
** Cookies may be set by an organization other than Itc.nl. These “third-party cookies” may, for example, originate from websites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus or other social media services for which Itc.nl has implemented so called plug-ins. Since the cookie policies of these sites change over time, you should determine their policies by visiting the privacy policy pages of these sites directly.

You may disable cookies through your individual browser options. Please note, however, that doing so may limit the functionality of Itc.nl.

**Email Policy  
** ITC will not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your email address for commercial purposes without your permission.

**Information Protection  
** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the appropriate use of information we gather about you, ITC has taken commercially reasonable steps to protect the information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.

**Changes to this Policy  
** This Privacy Policy may be amended from time to time. Any such changes will be posted on this page.
