Privacy Policy

Protecting your privacy is a priority at IT Business Edge. Please read this privacy policy to learn how we keep your personal information confidential while using it to enhance the information and services we provide you.

1\. Registration  
When you register with IT Business Edge you supply some personal information, including your e-mail address, required to begin your subscription(s) to IT Business Edge weekly reports. Once you subscribe to a weekly report, you can unsubscribe at any time by visiting this Web site.

2\. How is Collected Information Used?  
We use the personal information you supply to provide you with valuable information that is relevant to your professional interests. The information you receive via e-mail in our weekly reports is customized according to what you tell us about your top IT priorities.

3\. Information Sharing  
IT Business Edge never shares your personal information with third parties without your permission. If you choose to receive them, IT Business Edge will send you special offers from third-party companies we think will be of interest to you based on the information you have provided. Rest assured, these offers are carefully screened by the IT Business Edge staff to ensure their relevance to your interests and are sent by IT Business Edge, not by the offering company.

4\. Links to Third-Party Web Sites  
IT Business Edge weekly reports contain links to third-party Web sites. This privacy statement applies only to the IT Business Edge Web site and information collected by IT Business Edge. It does not apply to any third-party Web sites you access from our weekly reports or our Web site, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.

5\. Security  
IT Business Edge employs several physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information you provide us. Your IT Business Edge account information can only be accessed using the correct password, and the servers holding that information are protected by a firewall. IT Business Edge also uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to ensure your personal information is protected during data transmissions. And for the purpose of business operations, access to your information is limited to authorized employees who need it to perform their jobs or to provide you with requested services and products.

6\. Cookies  
A cookie is a small piece of computer code that lets Web servers "identify" visitors. Each time you initiate a session on the IT Business Edge site, our server uses a cookie to identify you as a subscriber and provide you with appropriate access privileges. These cookies do not store any of the personal information you have provided through the site; they are simply identifiers. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. However, if you turn cookies off, some features of our site will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly. You can find information about how you can adjust the cookie settings for common browsers at the following Web sites:

7\. Web Beacons  
IT Business Edge may use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear GIFs, to monitor the use of our Web site and e-mail reports. A Web beacon is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a Web page or e-mail containing it. (To learn more about Web beacons, see http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/Web_beacon.html).

8\. Redirected URLs  
IT Business Edge uses redirected URLs to keep track of Web traffic generated by links in our e-mail reports. Redirected URLs route subscribers to Web sites after recording who they are and the links they click. This information helps IT Business Edge further personalize the information we provide subscribers by sending them special reports and exclusive offers related to the topics that are most important to them. All subscribers receive special reports as a benefit of signing up for IT Business Edge, but only those who ask to receive special offers in their subscriber profiles receive this exclusive benefit.
