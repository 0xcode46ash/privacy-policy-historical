# Our Privacy Policy | ITBusinessEdge.com

Protecting your privacy is a priority at IT Business Edge. Please read this privacy policy to learn how we keep your personal information confidential while using it to enhance the information and services we provide you.

**1\. Registration**  
When you register with IT Business Edge you supply some personal information, including your e-mail address and other personal information, that is required to initiate your IT Business Edge membership and begin your subscription(s) to IT Business Edge weekly e-mail reports. After you subscribe to a specific weekly report, you can unsubscribe at any time by visiting this Web site. You can also have yourself removed from all IT Business Edge newsletter and promotional mailing lists at any time by clicking on the appropriate link on the My Account page.

**2\. How is Collected Information Used?**  
We use the personal information you supply to provide you with valuable information and offers that are relevant to your professional interests. For example, you select the specific e-mail newsletters you want to receive based on your individual business priorities. Based on information you share with us about your business, such as its location, industry and size, we will also send you updates about editorial content, white papers, research, training materials, templates and software tools that might meet your needs. Many of these resources are free, and some are offered at special discounts for IT Business Edge subscribers. Some sponsored content, such as white papers, webcasts, product information, and analyst or research reports, are provided at no charge in exchange for your willingness to share information about yourself with the sponsors who make the content available to IT Business Edge members.

**3\. Protecting Your Information and When We Share It**  
IT Business Edge is committed to protecting your personal information while delivering the high-value information and services you need. We never share your information with any organization or individual in any manner other than those stated in this Privacy Policy. We will share your information only in the following ways. A) When you view, download or request white papers, research reports, webcasts, or IT Downloads, the sponsor and/or provider of that content may receive the contact information you currently have on file for your IT Business Edge membership, along with the title of the content you are viewing or downloading at that time. The sponsor and/or provider of this content may also receive your answers to specific questions asked at the time you access or request the content, as well as information regarding similar or related content you downloaded or viewed in the past. If you do not want to share any information with the sponsors and/or providers of such content, you should avoid viewing or requesting sponsored content and downloading items from the IT Downloads library. B) If you elect to receive e-mail offers from our partners, IT Business Edge will send you such offers from time to time. Each offer is screened by the IT Business Edge staff to ensure its relevance and is delivered by us, not by the offering partner. In these instances, the only way the partner will receive any of your information is if you provide it while responding to the offer. You can opt out of receiving e-mail offers from partners at any time by unchecking the appropriate box at the bottom of the My Account page. C) By subscribing to IT Business Edge you give us permission to share your information with our vendors as required in the delivery of services, features and offers provided as part of your membership. For example, our e-mail delivery vendor may need to store your information on its servers while helping us send you weekly e-mail reports, and our charge processing vendor would need to accept your credit card information in order to process payment for a product purchased from IT Business Edge. These essential vendors will use your personal information only as needed to deliver products and services from IT Business Edge. At all times, IT Business Edge and the vendors with whom we work will employ industry-leading measures and technologies to protect your personal information.  


**4\. Links to Third-Party Web Sites**  
IT Business Edge weekly reports contain links to third-party Web sites. This privacy statement applies only to the IT Business Edge Web site and information collected by IT Business Edge. It does not apply to any third-party Web sites you access from our weekly reports or our Web site, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites.

**5\. Security**  
IT Business Edge employs several physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the personal information you provide us. Your IT Business Edge account information can only be accessed using the correct password, and the servers holding that information are protected by a firewall. IT Business Edge also uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to ensure your personal information is protected during data transmissions. And for the purpose of business operations, access to your information is limited to authorized employees who need it to perform their jobs or to provide you with requested services and products.

**6\. Cookies**  
A cookie is a small piece of computer code that lets Web servers "identify" visitors. Each time you initiate a session on the IT Business Edge site, our server uses a cookie to identify you as a subscriber and provide you with appropriate access privileges. These cookies do not store any of the personal information you have provided through the site; they are simply identifiers. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually refuse cookies, or selectively accept cookies, by adjusting the preferences in your browser. However, if you turn cookies off, some features of our site will not be available to you and some Web pages may not display properly.

**7\. Web Beacons**  
IT Business Edge may use electronic images known as Web beacons, or clear GIFs, to monitor the use of our Web site and e-mail reports. A Web beacon is a graphic image, often transparent and usually no larger than 1 pixel x 1 pixel, which works in combination with cookies to track usage of a Web page or e-mail containing it.

**8\. Redirected URLs**  
IT Business Edge uses redirected URLs to keep track of Web traffic generated by links in our e-mail reports. Redirected URLs route subscribers to Web sites after recording who they are and the links they click. This information helps IT Business Edge further personalize the information we provide subscribers by sending them special reports and exclusive offers related to the topics that are most important to them. All subscribers receive special reports as a benefit of signing up for IT Business Edge, but only those who ask to receive special offers in their subscriber profiles receive this exclusive benefit.
