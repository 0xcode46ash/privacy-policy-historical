### 2\. What We Collect

_In General._ We may collect and store any personally identifiable information you provide to us. Personally identifiable information is data that identifies you, or that can be combined with other information to identify or contact you, and includes (but is not limited to) your name, business or personal physical or email address, and telephone number.

You are not obligated to provide us with any personally identifiable information, although registration is required to access the full range of information and Services offered. TOOLBOX.COM enables users (“Members”) to create TOOLBOX.COM profiles, which allow them to control their profile information and whether it should be made public or private. This also allows members to identify themselves with their contributions to any TOOLBOX.COM Site and to manage their TOOLBOX.COM e-mail-based subscriptions. We strive to limit the type of personally identifiable information that we collect to information that helps us accomplish our goal of providing first-class services for the benefit of our existing and prospective Members.

_Members._ If you are a TOOLBOX.COM Member and access the restricted, Members-only areas of our Sites, TOOLBOX.COM may collect additional information relating to your participation in TOOLBOX.COM Services, such as collecting your resume for our Job Center. We also may obtain information about your access and use of TOOLBOX.COM research materials, decision-support tools, and other online and offline offerings. 

_Information from other sources._ We also may periodically obtain information about you from partners and other sources, and combine that information with information we collected from you. Examples of information we may receive includes updated contact information and additional demographic information.

_Information collected automatically._ When you visit the Sites, we automatically collect and analyze certain information about your computer. This information includes but may not be limited to the IP address used to connect your computer to the Internet, information about your browser type and language, the date and time you are accessing our site, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us, and the referring website address. 

_Use of cookies and other technologies._ We use various technologies to collect information about your activities on our site. 

  * _Cookies._ When you visit our Sites, we may assign your computer one or more "cookies." A cookie is a small text file that contains information that can later be read by us to facilitate your access to our Sites and personalize your online experience. For example, whenever you sign into our Sites, we will record your user ID in a cookie file on your computer. Cookies that TOOLBOX.COM creates that are stored on the user’s hard drive do not store any personally identifiable information. If applicable, we may also record your password in this cookie file, if you checked the box entitled "Save this password for automatic sign-in." Also, through the use of a cookie, we may automatically collect information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies by visiting the Help portion of your browser’s toolbar. If you choose to decline cookies, please note that you may not be able to sign in or use some of the interactive features offered on our Sites.
  

  * _Other Technologies._ We may use standard Internet technology, such as Web beacons(also called clear GIFs or pixel tags) and other similar technologies, to deliver or communicate with cookies and track your use of our Sites. We also may include web beacons in e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer and measure the overall effectiveness of our online content, advertising campaigns, and the products and services we offer through the Sites.



__Information Collected by Third Parties.__ Third parties, such as companies, advertising entities, and business partners, may use cookies and other technologies (such as Web beacons) to collect information about your online activities.

We do not have access to or control over cookies or other features these third parties may use, and the information practices of these third parties are subject to those third parties’ own privacy policies, not this Privacy Policy. Some of these third parties may be third-party network advertisers that offer you the option of not having this information collected.
