|  CONFIDENTIALITY  
---  
  
Any and all information collected by ITWeb will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned or otherwise disclosed. 

A more detailed explanation of how we safeguard your personal information is described below. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.  
  
 BROWSER INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THIS SITE  
  
We analyse our Web site logs to constantly improve the value of our content. These logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that browse the site.

ITWeb utilises users' IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. We also use the addresses to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences for content and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers to help them better understand our services and user demographics, but ITWeb does not give advertisers information about individual ITWeb users.  
  
 USE OF COOKIES  
Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to users' interests and to honour their preferences. This information is used to assist us in creating a site that will serve the needs of our users.  
 PRIVACY OF YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESSES  
  
ITWeb maintains several e-mail lists to keep subscribers, the press and interested members of the public informed about breaking events. Individuals must request to join our mailing lists by signing up through a form on our Web site. We do not sell, rent, loan, trade or lease the addresses on our list to anyone. In addition, we configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the e-mail addresses of our list subscribers to anyone but authorised staff.

Using e-mail addresses provided at registration or otherwise, ITWeb periodically sends out e-mail newsletters and promotional e-mail to our users about services and products offered by ITWeb. Users can indicate that they do not wish to receive e-mail information from ITWeb or its advertisers. Third-parties will not contact our users through the use of our e-mail newsletter lists except through advertisements within the newsletters themselves, or unless users ask to be placed on a list to receive e-mail from our advertisers on subjects of interest.  
  
 PRIVACY OF SURVEYS   
  
All responses collected in ITWeb's online surveys are completely confidential. Only the aggregate results of the research will be used. 

Any information about any individual will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned or otherwise disclosed. We ask for e-mail address only to avoid duplicate entries of data and to alert the respondent when the survey/competition results are posted online.   
  
 GENERAL  
ITWeb is not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of its advertisers or the Web sites to which it may provide links.
