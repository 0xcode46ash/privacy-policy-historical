LOAD assures that all individually identifiable information is kept confidential. LOAD does not sell or disclose any personal information about its users. Information users provide at registration is not distributed to any third party.

All personal information collected by LOAD (including credit card information) is kept in secure areas. LOAD uses secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to minimize the risk of compromising individually identifiable information.

It is LOAD's policy to respect the privacy of its Members. LOAD will not disclose the contents of Member's registration data unless required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on LOAD; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of LOAD; or (3) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of its members or the public.

Personal information, such as name and e-mail, are used primarily to recognize individual member accounts and to verify username and password. Occasionally, LOAD will use individually identifiable information, like e-mail addresses in order to contact the user for technical support or provide product updates and account information. LOAD provides various opt-out newsletters to its members. Members can unsubscribe from these newsletters at their own volition.

LOAD makes every effort to ensure that the information users provide is correct and up-to-date. Users will receive a welcome e-mail after they signup for any service. Members can change their information at any time by logging into their LOAD Account and updating their Personal Profile.

In order for any member to use a LOAD service, they must provide all information requested at the time of registration (site name, username, e-mail, URL, etc.). As previously mentioned, this individual identifiable information is necessary to keep track of member accounts and to contact the user, if necessary.

LOAD does track general information about people visiting its website and other pages with the LoadStats website analysis service by reading browser settings. This does not include any personal information. This information is only used to determine the composition of our visitors and common behavior. LOAD retains the right to use such information and information about members' websites (name, URL, traffic counts, etc.) in the marketing, general promotion, and publicity of LOAD and its services. LOAD reserves the right to publish, by default, 24-hour unique visitor statistics and other basic site information (including, but not limited to, country of origin, site name and site URL, but not including any proprietary information from members' sites) as part of LOAD's effort to deliver compelling case studies to its clients. At the client's discretion, additional LoadStats reports can also be made available for the public to view.

If you have any questions or concerns with this policy or any of LOAD's services, please send your comments to [info@load.com](mailto:info@load.com).
