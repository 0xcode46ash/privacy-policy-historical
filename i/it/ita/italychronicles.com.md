# Privacy Policy

### **Italy Chronicles’ Privacy Statement**

**Please note that ItalyChronicles.com** was formerly known as **BlogfromItaly.com**

#### **Website Visitors**

Like most website operators, ItalyChronicles.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ItalyChronicles.com’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ItalyChronicles.com’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ItalyChronicles.com may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ItalyChronicles.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. ItalyChronicles.com does not use such information to identify its visitors however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

#### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ItalyChronicles.com’s website choose to interact with ItalyChronicles.com in ways that require ItalyChronicles.com to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ItalyChronicles.com gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, I ask visitors who use my commenting system to provide a name and email address. In each case, ItalyChronicles.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ItalyChronicles.com.

ItalyChronicles.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

#### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

ItalyChronicles.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ItalyChronicles.com’s behalf or to provide services available at ItalyChronicles.com’s website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ItalyChronicles.com’s website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them.

ItalyChronicles.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations, as described above, ItalyChronicles.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when ItalyChronicles.com believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of ItalyChronicles.com, third parties, or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a ItalyChronicles.com website and have supplied your email address, ItalyChronicles.com may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ItalyChronicles.com and our products. I primarily use my blog to communicate this type of information, so I expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send me a request (for example via an email or via the commenting system), I reserve the right to publish it in order to help me clarify or respond to your request. ItalyChronicles.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
