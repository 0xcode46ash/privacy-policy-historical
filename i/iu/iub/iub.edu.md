  * The referring website
  * The date and time of visit
  * The duration of visit
  * Tour browser type

##### Information Sharing

We may share aggregate, non-personally-identifiable information with other entities or organizations.

If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may configure your browser not to accept them at all, or to notify and require approval before accepting new cookies. Some web pages/sites may not function properly if the cookies are turned off, or you may have to provide the same information each time you visit those pages.

Any other disclosure — with appropriate external parties such as law enforcement agencies — will be done in accordance with all applicable laws and university policies in order to investigate and respond to suspected violations of law or university policy.

#### Security

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies, no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. While we are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors, we cannot guarantee the security of any information that you transmit to university websites, and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your information, we will use reasonable safeguards consistent with prevailing industry standards and commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being stored to maintain the security of that information on our systems.

In addition, we will comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws regarding the privacy and security of visitor information.

We have appropriate security measures in place in our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that we have collected from you at our site.

#### Privacy Notice Changes

From time to time, we may use visitor information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice.

Only data collected from the time of the policy change forward will be used for these new purposes. Users can check this privacy notice periodically to learn of updates.
