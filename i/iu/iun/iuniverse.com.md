## Registration Processes

In order to use certain features of this Web site, you must first complete the registration form. These features include using myUniverse, interacting with communities, purchasing books or other goods and services, and submitting manuscripts for publication. During registration, we ask you to provide contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this information to provide you with a more personalized experience and to contact you, if necessary, regarding your order or manuscript submission. We also ask for information that helps us develop our business to better serve your needs, including your postal code, age group, and how you heard about iUniverse.

## Online Orders

On our order forms, we request contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have a question about your order, we will use this information to contact you.

## Web Site Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored by your Web browser on your hard drive. If you register on our site, we use cookies to record that information. This allows you to automatically reenter membership-only sections of the Web site without having to retype your username and password. We also use cookies to keep track of your order information as you step through the ordering process and to avoid errors if you are interrupted while ordering. If you decide not to accept cookies, you can still use our site, but these particular features will not work properly. We also use cookies to help us analyze our site log files (see the next paragraph for more information).

## Web Site Log Files

Like most Web sites, our site collects standard statistical information about site visits. We learn how many visitors come to our site, which pages are most popular, what paths visitors take to reach our site and move through it, what Web browsers are being used, and what IP addresses and domain names (such as aol.com or earthlink.net) visitors come from. However, none of this information is associated with you as an individual. It is measured only in aggregate. We use it to help us make our site as interesting and useful to you as we can.

## Information Sharing

We share aggregated information on site visitors with our partners to help them understand our business. We share aggregate sales data with our partners and authors, in order to pay them royalties on the sales of their works. This aggregate information is not linked to any personal information that can identify a single person.

We use outside printing and shipping companies to fulfill orders and a credit card processing company to bill for purchases. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

## External Links

Our Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the iUniverse Web site.

## Newsletters and Announcements

If you wish to subscribe to one of our newsletters or to receive periodic product and service announcements, we ask for your e-mail address, so we can send you the newsletter. If you no longer wish to receive the newsletter, please send an e-mail to [listserv@info.iuniverse.com](mailto:listserv@info.iuniverse.com) with the words "SIGNOFF iUniverse News" in the body of the e-mail.

## Surveys and Contests

From time to time, we may run surveys or contests on our Web site. Participation in these surveys or contests is voluntary. The information we request may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), demographic information (such as gender or education level), and your opinions about our site and our company. We use contact information to notify the winners and award prizes. We use survey information to evaluate and improve the usability and satisfaction of our site.

## Online and Offline Security

iUniverse takes precautions to protect our users' information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and offline.

When our registration or order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or Social Security Number), that information is encrypted. While on a secure page, such as the page that features our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer visibly becomes locked, as opposed to when you are just surfing.

Our servers are protected by a firewall and located within a secure, locked facility.

## Updating Personal Information

If your personal information changes (such as your e-mail or mailing address) or if you no longer desire our service, please visit our registration page to update your records.

## Notification of Changes

iUniverse will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this statement, we may notify you by placing prominent notice on other areas of the Web site.
