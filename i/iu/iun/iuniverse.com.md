# Privacy Policy -- iUniverse

_Updated: July 8, 2014_

Our privacy policy, as detailed below, answers questions you may have about access, security and control of personal information. It also describes how the information will be used, and whether it will be provided to third parties.

All companies that are part of Author Solutions, LLC believe that your personal information – including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card data – belongs to you. While we collect this type of information when you provide it to us, we do not rent or sell it to third parties. We use it only to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.

The United States Federal Trade Commission has created a Web site, [OnGuard Online](http://www.onguardonline.gov/ "On Guard Online"), which provides general tips about navigating the Internet. The Web site is filled with information about how to use the Internet wisely, how to avoid fraud and deception online, and how to keep personal information private.

### WHAT INFORMATION DO AUTHOR SOLUTIONS COMPANIES COLLECT?

When users visit our Web sites, there are two types of information that may be collected.

The first type of information is known as “personally identifiable information.” In order to serve your needs and to provide improved products and services, we may from time to time request personal and private information, such as your name or company, address, contact information, education, interests, payment information when you place orders, survey information and/or other information. You may choose to provide this information at your option. Many areas of our site are accessible without providing any personally identifiable information. Personally identifiable information excludes any information you may choose to submit publicly, such as reviews, critiques, editorials, testimonials, documentaries, forum or blog discussions.

You may choose to place orders or to set up an account to obtain additional information or to order products and/or services. If you place an order or set up such an account, certain private information will be needed, such as your name or company, address, contact information and payment arrangements. We will maintain a history of orders and payments via your account for normal accounting and business purposes. Author Solutions, LLC does not rent, sell or share personal information about you with other people or companies that are not our partners or affiliates.

If you choose not to provide private information to this Web site, alternate ordering and payment arrangements can be made by providing the necessary information via telephone, fax or mail, or via another standard method of communication.

To better serve you, iUniverse may share your name and contact information with companies that are part of Author Solutions, LLC, which offer products or services desirable or useful to you. Author Solutions, LLC companies share aspects of common ownership and control.

Such companies currently include AuthorHouse, AuthorHouse UK, iUniverse, Xlibris, and Trafford.

We may use your e-mail address to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the Web site, new services and special offers we think you’ll find valuable. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own or third parties' products or services, you can opt-out by emailing us stating your request at _[unsubscribe@iuniverse.com](mailto:unsubscribe@iuniverse.com "unsubscribe@iuniverse.com")_  and so specifying. This opt out does not apply to information  exchanged via email to facilitate, complete or confirm our transaction with you, to provide warranty or security information, to notify you of a change in terms or features, or to deliver to you goods or services, including updates or upgrades, that you are entitled to receive.

We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (1) comply with law, (2) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (3) protect the rights, property, or safety of Author Solutions and its affiliated companies, our users or others.

We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to:

Respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; or defend against legal claims.

Believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Author Solutions, LLC's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

Transfer information about you if Author Solutions, LLC is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Author Solutions, LLC will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

The second type of information is known as “non-personally identifiable information” and is collected upon each visit to our Web site. Our server automatically recognizes visitors’ domain names and Internet Protocol addresses (where possible). We also collect information and statistics about how visitors use the site. This information, which is collected and maintained in an anonymous, non-personal and composite form, allows us to improve the content of our Web site and facilitate market research.

### DOES AUTHOR SOLUTIONS USE NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION?

On occasion, we may provide non-personally identifiable information about our users, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors to help us understand this information better. However, these statistics will not include any personally identifiable information. Other than improving our Web site and providing our visitors with the best experience possible, we make no other use of this information.

### HOW DOES AUTHOR SOLUTIONS PROTECT USER INFORMATION?

We use encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All of your ordering information – including your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address and credit card data – is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security.

Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution called Merchant e-Solutions, the world's recognized leader in e-commerce payment solutions. They receive the credit card data only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.

Furthermore, your credit card and billing information cannot be read as it travels to our ordering system. To ensure that your information is even more secure, once we receive your credit card information, we store only the last five digits on a server that is not accessible from the Internet.

### COOKIES

When you visit a Web site, information may be stored in a file known as a “cookie.” This file is stored on your computer and is used for future reference. If you revisit a Web site, the cookie allows that Web site to identify you as a returning guest and tailor your shopping experience to you.

We use cookies in two places. The first is when a user places an order. We use cookies to fill in their name and e-mail address in the form where appropriate (this is known as “auto-fill.”) The second is when a customer uses the User Registration page. Again, we use cookies for auto-filling the form.

Most Web browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block acceptance of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your Web browser’s help file to learn more about these functions.

The information contained in our cookies is only used by Author Solutions. Your Web browser will not pass a cookie to a site other than the one that created it.

### SECURITY

Author Solutions is committed to maintaining the privacy of your personally identifiable information, and will treat the privacy of your information with the same or greater security protections as we provide for our own private information. Author Solutions, LLC company Web sites have industry-standard security measures in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. While there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet, we take reasonable steps to ensure the safety of all information.

Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, all employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices.
