**INDIANA** ******UNIVERSITY** ****

**ONLINE PRIVACY STATEMENT**

Indiana University respects the privacy of visitors to its web sites.  This Online Privacy Statement explains the University’s policy concerning the collection, use, and disclosure of visitor information. 

University web sites will comply with all applicable laws and institutional policy regarding visitor privacy.

**Applicability**

This statement applies to all web sites that are created or maintained either by or for academic, administrative, or auxiliary units of the University (“University web sites”), regardless of whether or not the sites are hosted on University servers or external servers.  This includes web sites of professional associations and publications that are formally hosted, maintained and operated by faculty or staff of the University.  All University websites must post a readily visible link to this policy on the initial page of the site.

All other web sites that may be hosted on University servers, such as personal home pages and student organizational web sites, are encouraged to adhere to the terms of this statement as well.  _The University is not responsible, however, for the content of these sites or for their practices regarding the privacy of their online visitors._

This statement does NOT apply to University web sites that support web-based research, as “research” is defined in Federal law and in University policy governing human subjects-based research.  Sites engaged in web-based research must have prior review and approval by the University Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Human Subjects Committee (HSC). 

**Maintenance of the Online Privacy Statement**

Because Internet technologies continue to evolve rapidly, the University may make appropriate changes to this statement in the future.  Any such changes will be consistent with the University’s commitment to respecting visitor privacy, and will be clearly posted in a revised Online Privacy Statement. 

**Technical Information** ****

When you access a University web site from the Internet, your computer automatically provides its Internet Protocol (“IP”) address to the computer hosting that web site, as is the case when you attach to any Internet-connected computer.  This is so that the computer knows where to send the requested information.  Also, if you use a modem to dial into the Indiana University network, we receive the phone number of the telephone to which your modem is connected (unless you have caller-id information blocked).  

We collect and store this information in the University’s computer system for a limited period of time, 30-60 days.  We use this information in aggregate form in order to help diagnose problems with our computer systems, plan the use of system capacity, and improve the quality of the information and services available to you on our web sites. 

Some University web sites may also automatically collect and store certain information about your visit, such as the date, time, and duration of the visit and the Internet address of the site that referred you to them (via a web link).  This information is used in the aggregate to help manage the sites and improve service generally, and may also be used to customize the services offered to you. 

Except as provided in the Disclosure of Information ** __** section below, the University does not attempt to use the technical information discussed in this section to identify individual visitors. 

**Cookies**

A “cookie” is a small data file that is written to your hard drive that contains information about your visit to a web page.  University web sites may use cookies to store information about your actions or choices on pages associated with those web sites, in order to customize the information and services that the sites offer you.  University web sites must clearly inform visitors if they use cookies.  If you prefer not to receive cookies, you may turn them off in your browser, or you may set your browser to ask you before accepting a new cookie; see the Indiana University Knowledgebase article at http://kb.indiana.edu/data/agwm.html for more information.  Some University web pages may not function properly if the cookies are turned off, or you may have to provide the same information each time you visit those pages.

**Information Visitors Provide Voluntarily**

**_General_**

A lot of information is necessarily collected when an individual establishes a formal relationship with the University (as a student, employee, or faculty, for examples).  This information is generally required to maintain and manage that relationship, including providing associated necessary services.  If, in the course of visits to University web sites, individuals in these categories find that information being displayed about them or their status is incorrect, they should contact the appropriate office to have it corrected (i.e., Human Resources Management, Student Affairs, Academic Affairs, etc.).

Other than this necessary information, some technical information, and cookies as described above, the only other information that University web sites may obtain will be information that you provide voluntarily.  University web sites may ask you to provide information in order to make products and services available to you or to better understand and serve your needs.   

All University web sites that ask you to provide information must: 

·        state why the information is being requested and how it will be used;

·        use the information only for the stated purpose;

·        state whether the information will be shared with any external party (other than for investigative or law enforcement purposes described in the Disclosure of Information section below); 

·        make a copy of your information available to you on request;

·        delete or modify your information on request; 

·        state that you may contact the site’s Webmaster to obtain, modify, or delete information you have provided, and give you the Webmaster’s contact information; 

·        state that providing the requested information is wholly voluntary, and indicate how not providing the requested information (or subsequently asking that the data be removed) will affect the delivery of products or services for which the information is needed;

·        provide the statements they are required to make to you in a way that is easily seen and read before you submit any requested information; and

·        provide a link to this University Online Privacy Policy. 

**_Special Requirements for Requesting Social Security Numbers_**

Certain University web sites, such as those related to student financial aid or employment, may ask you to provide your Social Security Number (SSN) in order to process aid applications or carry out other operations.  Any University web site that asks specifically for your SSN (as opposed to asking for a Student or Employee ID or similar identifier) must state

·        why it is asking for the SSN; and

·        that Federal law requires the University to obtain the SSN (giving the citation to the applicable Federal law) and that the relevant form or application cannot be processed without the SSN, or 

·        that providing the SSN is voluntary and that you have the right to refuse to provide it without penalty. 

**Unsolicited Email**

If you send unsolicited email to a Webmaster, it will be directed to appropriate personnel for any response, and may be used to help improve the services supported by the web site. 

**Disclosure of Information**

Other than sharing your information with appropriate University personnel to ensure the quality, functionality, and security of our web sites, the University will not disclose your information except under the following circumstances: 

·        With your prior written (including email) consent;

·        When a University web site has given you clear notice that it will disclose information that you voluntarily provide; 

·        With appropriate University personnel and external parties, such as law enforcement agencies, in order to investigate and respond to suspected violations of law or University policy.  Any such disclosures shall comply with all applicable laws and University policies. 

**Security**

Due to the rapidly evolving nature of information technologies, no transmission of data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure.  While Indiana University is committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors, the University cannot _guarantee_ the security of any information that you transmit to University web sites, and you do so at your own risk. 

Once the University receives your information, we will use our best efforts to maintain the security of that information on University systems.  Units that maintain University web sites are expected to maintain those sites, and supporting systems and databases, at a security level consistent with prevailing industry standards, commensurate with the sensitivity of the data being stored. 

In addition, Indiana University will comply with all Federal, State and local laws regarding the privacy and security of visitor information. 

**Links to non-University web sites**

University web sites may provide links to other, non-University web sites.  The University is not responsible for the availability, content, or privacy practices of those sites.  They are not bound by this Privacy Statement and may or may not have their own privacy policies. 

**Contact Information**

If you have questions or concerns about a University web site’s compliance with this policy, please contact the Webmaster of the site in question.  If this does not resolve the matter, or if you have general questions or concerns about privacy or information technology policy at Indiana University, please contact the University IT Policy Office, 2711 E. 10th Street, Bloomington, IN 47408, 812-855-9255, itpo@iu.edu. 

If you have general questions or concerns about information technology security at Indiana University, please contact the University IT Security Office at 2711 E. 10th Street, Bloomington, IN 47408, 812-855-9255, [itso@iu.edu](mailto:itso@iu.edu).
