_Non-Personal Information We Collect_ Through Tracking Technologies. Non-Personal Information is information that without the aid of additional information cannot be directly associated with a specific person or entity. We use technology to automatically collect this type of non-personal information to better improve our Services. The information we collect through these technologies may include:

  * _Information from your Browser or Device_. The web servers for our Services automatically record certain non-personally identifiable computer information. For instance, when you use any of our Services, we collect your browser type and IP address.  This information is gathered for all visitors and users of our Services. This information is used in aggregate form to help us understand how our customer use our Services.
  * _Information from Cookies_ _._ We may use “cookies” with our Services. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive by our web server. Cookies are uniquely assigned to a computer, and your computer will only allow our web servers to access our cookies. Cookies allow us to collect web data and information such as web pages visited by using our Services, time and date information, the website you came through to reach our Services, and whether or not you clicked on any links while at our website or using our Services. We may collect this non-personal information through the use of cookies and other similar software technologies. You may have the right to delete cookies placed on your hard drive, which will erase the data automatically saved during your visit. However, that will mean that our Services will not recognize you when your return or that you may not be able to use our Services. You may also be able to modify your web browser to notify you before accepting cookies, or to decline all cookies.
  * _Web Beacons_. Pages of our Services and our emails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). Unlike cookies, you cannot decline web beacons. However, setting your browser to decline cookies or to prompt you for a response generally may keep web beacons from storing your activity.  
__
  * _Flash Cookies_. These are similar to cookies, except that they can store more complex data to provide greater website functionality and to remember your settings, preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Site. Flash cookies operate differently than regular browser cookies, and cannot be removed or blocked via regular web browser settings. To learn more about how to manage flash cookies, you can visit the Adobe website and follow the directions provided by Adobe with respect to the Flash settings and make changes as directed therein. Limiting the acceptance of flash cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications.
  * _Technical Data_. The servers we use also collect usage, viewing and technical data when visiting our website or using our Services through us and our service providers. The data entries in these logs are used for server and network operation and maintenance and to help us understand general usage patterns.
  * _Geolocation_. Certain of our technologies we use collect information that identifies a device’s location (geolocation information) either provided by a mobile device interacting with our website or our Services or associated with a user’s [IP address](https://disneyprivacycenter.com/privacy-policy-translations/english/#def_IPAddress).
  * _Other_. If you ask us to connect with other sites (for example if you ask us to connect with your Facebook account) we may get information that way too; we may record any telephone calls for quality assurance and training purposes.



_Aggregated, Non-Personal Information_. We may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the users of our Services in order to determine information regarding the use of our Services, and general information about our customers. We may also group this information to provide general aggregated data. The aggregated data will not personally identify any user of our Services. Once data has been de-identified, aggregated or summarized it shall no longer be considered personal information.

**How We Use Collected Information**

That information may be stored by us, and, may also be collected and stored by our payments processing vendor(s) for the purpose of processing payments made to us or to you depending on our customer requested Services. We (and our vendors) will not use that information for any other purposes.
  * Contact you with information on Services, new Services or products, or upcoming events subject to your rights below under “ **Commercial Messages and Your Right to Opt-Out**.”



Personal information we collect may be transferred to or stored in other countries for processing or storage.  By using our Services, you consent to the transfer of your personal information to countries outside your country of residence, which may have different personal data protection rules than in your country.

**How We Disclose the Information We Collect**

We do not share, sell, rent, or transfer personal information other than as described in this Privacy Policy. We may disclose or share or transfer the information we collect as follows:

  * To third party vendors, suppliers and affiliates who process information on our behalf so that we can provide and operate the Services and our business, such as hosting providers and payment processing providers and who are bound by law or contract to protect information and only use information in accordance with our instructions. These service providers are only given the information needed to perform their specialized services and not to use or disclose the information for any other purpose.
  * As needed to support external auditing, legal compliance and corporate governance functions.
  * If we are required to do so by law or legal process, such as to comply with any court order or subpoena or to respond to any government or regulatory request.
  * If we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of us, our customers, their employees or others, to protect the safety and security of our website and Services, to enable us to take precautions against liability, or to law enforcement agencies or for an investigation related to public safety. In some cases, disclosure may be required by law to be without notice.
  * In addition, if we or our subsidiaries are involved in a merger, divestiture, restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or transfer of some or all of our assets, whether as a going concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar proceeding or event, we may transfer the personal information we have collected or maintain to the buyer or other successor.
  * Please note that we may also use and disclose information about you that is not personally identifiable. For example, we may publish reports that contain aggregated and statistical data about our customers and their employees. These reports do not contain any information that would enable the recipient to contact, locate or identify you. These reports also do not contain any identifiable company information. We may disclose aggregated information about many of our users, and information that does not identify any individual or device.



##### **Third-Party Websites**

Our website and Services may contain links to other sites not owned or controlled by us and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites as they may differ from our privacy practices. We recommend that you read the privacy statement of each website that collects personal information, as their privacy statement will govern any personal or sensitive information you submit to those sites. This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by us through our Services.

Additionally, if you choose to click on a third party link, we may provide non-personally identifiable information to the third party. Also, the third party may use cookies or other technologies to collect information when you are visiting their websites. The information advertisers or other third parties collect is governed by their individual privacy policies, not by our privacy policy.

**Security**

The security, integrity and confidentiality of collected information is important to us. We have implemented reasonably commercial technical, administrative and physical security measures that are designed to protect information from unauthorized access, disclosure, use and modification that are appropriate for the type of personal information. For example, we use industry-standard encryption technology to secure personal and sensitive information when it is being collected and transmitted over the Internet as well as firewalls, site monitoring and intrusion detection software. Please be aware though that, despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Users of our Services are responsible for maintaining the security of any password, user ID, or other form of authentication involved in obtaining access to password protected or secure areas of any of our Services. In order to protect you and your information, we may suspend your use of our Services, without notice, pending an investigation, if any breach of security is suspected.

**Data Retention Policy**

We will retain personal and sensitive information for the length of time needed to fulfill our Services obligations to our customers or for the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless a longer or shorter retention period is required or permitted by law, after which we appropriately dispose of such information.

**Biometric Data Policy**

_Our Facial Recognition Products_.  We offer to our customers the ability to use facial recognition technology software through our GeoPunch® mobile time collection application and our AirClock™ time collection device.  We offer these products for use with our AsureForce® time and attendance on demand Services to more efficiently capture time collection as well as effectively prevent buddy punching and other deceptive employee practices. These products create a facial biometric scan (a “face scan”) of a person’s facial features, like the distance between the eyes, nose and ears, based on a photo submitted to us through the use of these products.  The photo and face scan are submitted to us solely in connection with such person’s employment with our customer.  We collect, use and store these photos and face scans on our customer’s behalf to validate and authenticate an employee’s time punch (in and out).  We use these face scans solely for the purposes as requested by our customer (the employer) to perform the time and attendance Services we have been engaged for. All transmission of face scans are encrypted and we cannot use a face scan to recreate an image of any person.

_Policy Applies to Persons in Jurisdictions with Biometric Data Privacy Laws_. Our policy applies to persons residing in jurisdictions with biometric data privacy laws. The purposes of this policy is to inform individuals of our customers who use our GeoPunch and AirClock products in connection with their employment with our customer (the employer) who have engaged us to provide such Services that:

  * a biometric identifier (face scan) is being collected and stored by us;
  * we collect, use and store this information solely in connection with a person’s employment with our customer (the employer) and as directed by our customer (the employer);
  * the purpose for collecting this information on our customer’s (the employer’s) behalf is to provide time and attendance Services to our customer (the employer) that improves time collection, and to prevent buddy punching and other deceptive employee practices within our customer’s organization;
  * we collect, use and store this information for an individual employee for the period of time as directed by our customer under our service agreement with them, subject to a shorter or longer time period as required under applicable law;
  * we will retain this information for as long as needed to fulfill the purposes outlined above or for a longer period of time as may be permitted or required under law, after which the face scan will be permanently destroyed;
  * we may disclose, redisclose or disseminate a person’s face scan in limited ways as permitted under applicable law such as with the person’s consent, the disclosure or redisclosure is required by a national, country, state or local law including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; the disclosure is required pursuant to a valid warrant or subpoena issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or the disclosure is consistent with our general Privacy Policy (and permitted under applicable law).



_Informed Consent_.  By using one of our facial recognition technologies, such person who is using the technology consents to our and our service provider’s who assist in performing our Services, collection, use and storing of such person’s photos and face scans in accordance with the terms of this policy or applicable law.  Our customer is initially responsible for obtaining its employees consent to the collection, use, and storing of a face scan. This is typically done upon initial employment or through enrollment and training in the use of our products. We will also endeavor to obtain through our technology where possible a minimum one time consent from each person to the collection, use and storing of such person’s face scan in connection with providing our Services to our customer and such person as an employee of our customer.

**Do Not Track**

Without a common industry or legal standard for interpreting Do Not Track (DNT) signals, we do not respond to browser DNT signals. We will continue to monitor further development of a DNT standard by the privacy community and industry.

**Children Under 13**

If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under 13 we will endeavor to delete that information from our databases.  If you have reason to believe that a child under 13 has provided personal information to us through our website or Service, please contact us, so we can endeavor to delete that information from our databases.
