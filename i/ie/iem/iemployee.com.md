# About Us | iEmployee

We have great respect for your privacy. In order to keep you informed of our privacy practices concerning this website, we have provided the following privacy policy. If you have questions, please direct them to our webmaster.

Personal Information and Your Privacy

Our website is dynamically personalized just for you. We collect demographic data based on your browsing choices, and also when you fill out your user profile on our site in order to help you find the information you are looking for. The choice is yours, but we can serve you better the more you tell us about your needs.

Aggregate usage information for our website is collected and analyzed in order to help us improve the web site. This information is collected in aggregate form and is generally not associated with any personal information.

Personal information provided to us directly (for example, registering for a Webcast, or providing contact information so we can contact you) will not be sold or rented to any third party. We will use the information for our normal business operations, which may require that we provide it to administrators, consultants, vendors or others operating on our behalf. Aggregate or demographic data may be shared with clients or consultants in aggregate form only. We may also use the information to contact customers to further discuss customer interest in our company, the products and services that we provide, and to send information regarding our company or partners, such as promotions and events. Customer email addresses and any personal customer information will not be distributed or shared with third parties. Customers can opt out of being contacted by us, or receiving such information from us, at any time by sending an email to our [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@asuresoftware.com).

iEmployee may collect financial and billing information for customers who purchase iEmployee products or services. All financial and billing information that we collect through the website is used solely to check the qualifications of prospective customers and to bill for the Service. This billing information is not used by iEmployee for marketing or promotional purposes. iEmployee uses a third-party intermediary to manage the credit card processing. This intermediary is solely a link in the distribution chain, and is not permitted to store, retain, or use the information provided, except for the sole purpose of credit card processing.

Customers of iEmployee's "On Demand" Services will be using iEmployee's hosted service to store data and information ("Data"). iEmployee will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any such Data except as provided in the iEmployee Limited Use License Agreement, or as may be required by law. Individual records may at times be viewed or accessed only for the purpose of resolving a problem, support issue, or suspected violation of the Limited Use License Agreement, or as may be required by law. Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.

Security

We are committed to keeping your personal information safe. We do not collect any personally sensitive information, aside from contact information. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

We may occasionally send targeted mailings to specific market segments. Lists for electronic mailings are acquired only from legitimate opt-in vendors or existing customer lists.

If you believe you were sent something in error, or are having trouble unsubscribing, please contact our [mail abuse handler](mailto:webmaster@asuresoftware.com) to ensure that appropriate action can be taken. We use only opt-in lists, so if you didn't opt-in, we want to know!
