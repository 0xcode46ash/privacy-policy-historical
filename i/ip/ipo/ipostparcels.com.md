Security
At UK Mail we take security very seriously including the use of the online credit card payment facility operated by
Online Payments Limited. Your browser will go into secure mode before you enter any payment details. You
can check that you are making such payments in a secure environment by looking for either a locked padlock or a
key icon in the grey bar at the bottom of your screen or when the address bar goes green.
Being in 'secure mode' means that all of your details are encrypted to help keep them secure. Encryption creates
billions of code combinations to protect each transaction made on our Website, so your card details cannot be
viewed by anyone else using the Internet. No credit or debit card details are stored on our servers once your initial
payment has been processed. They are stored securely with Online Payments Limited. Once on their
systems, all sensitive data is secured using internationally recognised 256-bit encryption standards. The
encryption keys are held on state-of-the-art, tamper proof systems in the same family as those used to secure


VeriSign's Global Root certificate, making them all but impossible to extract. The data they hold is extremely
secure and they are regularly audited by the banks and banking authorities to ensure it remains so.
If you have any further concerns about security, please email our Customer Service team at
marketing@ukmail.com or call our Customer Service team on 08451 552 552.
