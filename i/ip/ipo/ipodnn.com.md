# Privacy Policy | iPodNN

**iPodNN.com Privacy Statement  
Version 1.2**

Internet user privacy is of paramount importance to iPodNN.com and its related sites. The success of our business depends upon our ability to maintain the trust of our users. Below is information regarding iPodNN's commitment to protect the privacy of users and to ensure the integrity of the Internet.

**User Information**

During your visit to the site, iPodNN does not collect any personally-identifiable information about you that you do not specifically volunteer. This information may be volunteered when you create an account on the iPodNN discussion forums located at [http://www.macnn.com/forums/](https://web.archive.org/web/20091126042140id_/http://www.ipodnn.com/privacy/%C3%93http://www.macnn.com/forums/%C3%93). However, even then, iPodNN does not use that stored information for any purpose other than to allow you to log in and post messages. 

iPodNN does, however, automatically collect certain non-personally-identifiable information about you, such as your browser type and the IP address that your ISP designates to your machine (which, with dial-up accounts, usually changes every time you connect). This is standard practice for web sites, and is not used for any purpose other than to evaluate how we can design the site to best serve your needs. This information is not sold to any third parties, or available to anybody outside of the iPodNN staff.

**Cookies**

iPodNN, along with thousands of other Web sites, uses cookies to enhance your experience. Cookies are used in the iPodNN discussion forums to keep track of which messages have been posted since your last visit, easing the navigation of the forums. Cookies can also store your user name and password so that you do not have to log in each time you want to post a message, though you must specifically request that this feature be turned on. You can do this by clicking on "prefs" in the iPodNN discussion forums toolbar.

Cookie data is not stored on the server, and therefore, not available for viewing by iPodNN staff or any third parties. However, it is possible that security flaws exist in some browsers that would allow other site administrators to write malicious scripts that would collect this data without iPodNN's knowledge, though this is quite unlikely.

**Third-party Ad Server**

A portion of the advertisements displayed on the MacNN Network are served by third-party advertisers, including Advertising.com, DoubleClick, and other sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by MAXOnline, please [click here](http://www.maxonline.com/privacy_policy/index.php).

We are committed to continuing to protect the privacy of our readers.If you have any additional questions, please contact us at [privacy@iPodNN.com](mailto:privacy@macnn.com). 

We recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically, as iPodNN may update it from time to time without notice to its users.
