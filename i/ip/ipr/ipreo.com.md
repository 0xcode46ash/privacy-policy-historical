We may revise this Policy from time to time in order to address new or revised website functionality, new or revised aspects of the Internet technology, or applicable law. The handling of personal information is governed by the version of this Policy in effect when such information is received; therefore, you should review it from time to time to be sure that you are aware of the applicable provisions.
