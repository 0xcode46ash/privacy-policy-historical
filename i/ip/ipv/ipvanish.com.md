After you have created an account, you will be able to access and modify your account information and renew your subscription through your account.

Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies on our Site

This section describes the information we collect about _visitors to our Site_. As noted above, **we do _not_ track user activities outside of our Site, nor do we track the web activities of users when they are logged into our VPN Services**. 

We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies to understand how users access and use our Site. In general, you can browse our Site without telling us who you are or submitting any personal information. However, we collect the IP addresses of all visitors to our Site, as well as other related information such as page requests, browser type, operating system and average time spent on our Site. We use this information to help us understand Site activity and to monitor and improve our Site. 

_Cookies_. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. Session cookies exist only during an online session; we use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to your account at the Site. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity. 

_Disabling Cookies_. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site but certain Site features will not function. 

_Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_. We or the third parties we engage may employ clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site by among other things, tracking the activities of our Site visitors and compiling statistics about Site usage. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or within emails. 

_Third Parties_. We may engage third parties, such as Google Analytics, to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site data. These third parties may use cookies and clear GIFs on our Site to collect, analyze, and generate reports on Site usage for us. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you. 

The Security Measures We Have In Place

We use security measures that are consistent with industry standards to protect your personal information from loss, theft, misuse or unauthorized access or disclosure or destruction,. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. In addition, access to user or subscriber personal information is restricted to those who need to know such information to perform their job functions. 

Where appropriate, we use encryption, access controls, passwords, and/or physical security measures to protect the personal information we collect and maintain about you against unauthorized access and disclosure. Despite our efforts, no data security methods guarantee 100% protection. We do not promise and cannot guarantee that your personal information can never be viewed and/or used by others. 

Links To Other Sites

We provide links to third party websites as a convenience to our users. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked websites. We recommend that you carefully read the privacy statements, notices and terms of use or service of any other websites that you visit. We do not have any control over such websites, and therefore we assume no responsibility for the manner in which the organizations that operate such websites collect, use, maintain or disclose your personal information. 

Marketing Emails

We may send you marketing and promotional emails about products, services and other information we think may interest you. You may unsubscribe from such emails at any time by emailing us at [support@ipvanish.com](mailto:support@ipvanish.com) and telling us you would like to "unsubscribe from marketing emails." In addition, if you receive a marketing or promotional e-mail from us, you may click the unsubscribe link contained in the e-mail to "opt out" of receiving future promotional e-mails from us. However, we may continue to send you emails about your account and for other customer-service-related purposes. 

How To Modify Your Personal Information

Requests to review or amend your account information, or for technical support, service information, and changes in usage should be sent to: [support@ipvanish.com](mailto:support@ipvanish.com). We try to respond to all requests in a timely manner. You may also view and amend much of your account information, or update or renew your subscription, by logging in to your account and updating your account information. 

Children's Privacy

Our Site and Services are not intended for anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child under 13 has provided personal information to us, please contact us so that we can delete the child's information.

When you create an online account with us from outside the United States, you agree to the terms of this Policy and our Terms of Service, and give your consent to the transfer to and processing of such information in the United States, which may not offer an equivalent level of data protection as that in the European Union, Canada or other countries.
