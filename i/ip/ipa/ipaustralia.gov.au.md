### Website Privacy Information

### Clickstream data

Clickstreams are the paths a user takes when navigating a web page or the Internet in general.

When you visit IP Australia our Internet Service Provider makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes - the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, .uk etc), the date and time of visit to the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited, and the type of browser used.

IP Australia examines this information to determine the traffic through the server as well as access levels to specific pages. In order to deliver better services, IP Australia also performs statistical analysis to establish priorities and allocate resources. No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider's logs. The statistics and log files may be preserved indefinitely and used at any time an in any way necessary to prevent security breaches and to ensure the integrity of the information supplied by IP Australia.

### Cookies

A cookie is a short piece of data which is sent from a web server to a web browser on the user's machine when the browser visits the server's site. The cookie is stored on the user's machine, but it is not an executable program and cannot do anything to your machine.

Whenever a web browser requests a file from the same web server that sent the cookie, the browser sends a copy of that cookie back to the server along with the request. In this way, the server knows you have visited before and can co-ordinate your access to different pages on its web site. A server cannot find out a name or e-mail address, or anything about a user's computer, by using cookies.

IP Australia uses cookies to obtain session details for access to parts of our sites. Cookies are essential in providing a seamless access to our on-line databases. Cookie information is not stored or collected by IP Australia. 

IP Australia use Survey Monkey, a third party software supplier, to administer online surveys. These surveys use third party cookies; the information collected by the cookies is not capable of identifying you and is only used to ensure our surveys run effectively. IP Australia will only use the information collected from the surveys for statistical and maintenance purposes. A copy of [Survey Monkey's privacy policy](http://www.surveymonkey.com/Monkey_Privacy.aspx) can be found on their [website](http://www.surveymonkey.com.au/).

IP Australia uses [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/) to collect information about visitors to the IP Australia corporate site. Google Analytics uses first-party cookies and JavaScript code to collect information about visitors to the IP Australia corporate site. It anonymously tracks how our visitors interact with this website, including where they came from, what they did on the site including such things as newsletter registration. It does not track any application processes or procedures from our [Online Services](https://pericles.ipaustralia.gov.au/ols/ecentre/content/olsHome.jsp) section.

If you subscribe to one of our opt-in [mailing lists](http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/resources/lists_index.shtml) we will only use your email address for the purpose for which you have provided it. In particular we will not add it to a mailing list unless you request that this be done.
