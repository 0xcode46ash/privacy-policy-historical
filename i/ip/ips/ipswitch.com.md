**HOW DOES IPSWITCH USE MY E-MAIL ADDRESS AND CAN IOPT-OUT OF RECEIVING IPSWITCH E-MAIL MESSAGES?**

_Downloading an evaluation:_ We ask for your e-mail address before downloading a free product evaluation. If at anytime you decide that you do not want to receive further messages from us, each e-mail will include a link to our [unsubscribe page](https://web.archive.org/unsubscribe.asp). Your contact information may be forwarded to an authorized Ipswitch reseller in your area, in which case you may need to follow-up with them. Unsubscribing will not interrupt any ongoing conversations you may be having with Ipswitch.

_Contacting us for technical or customer support:_ Your e-mail address will be used to respond to your query. In some cases, we may invite you to participate in an online survey to let us know how we are doing.

_Subscribing to the Ipswitch Newsletter:_ When you sign up for the Ipswitch Newsletter, your e-mail address is not used for any purpose other than to send you the newsletter on a monthly basis. You may unsubscribe from the newsletter [here](https://web.archive.org/Company/newsletter.html).

_Subscribing to a discussion list:_ When you sign up for a discussion list, your e-mail address is not used for any purpose other than to send you the discussion list in the format you choose on the discussion lists page. You may unsubscribe or change your format preference from the [discussion lists page](https://web.archive.org/Support/mailing-lists.html).

If you are using the same e-mail address for multiple items above, the e-mail usage information for 'downloading an evaluation' takes precedent over all other e-mail usage information.

You may also remove yourself from our database by sending an e-mail to [remove@ipswitch.com](mailto:remove@ipswitch.com) from the e-mail address you would like to unsubscribe from.

Please note: If you opt-out or unsubscribe, you will not receive notifications about bug fixes or new product releases. It will be up to you to check the Ipswitch Web Site for this information.

**CAN I CHANGE/MODIFY MY CONTACT INFO?**

Ipswitch gives users the option to modify their contact information previously provided. Send e-mail to: [contactinfo@ipswitch.com](mailto:contactinfo@ipswitch.com)

**ADWARE POLICY**

Ipswitch does not embed advertising (adware) in any of our software, for two principal reasons. First, adware can be used to monitor your use of software (such as sites selected or files used) or to provide demographic data about you to third parties. Second, we consider it very important not to compromise the quality, speed, and ease of use of our software by displaying ads in it.
