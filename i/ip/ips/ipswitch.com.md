If you set your browser to refuse cookies, the Web beacon will provide us only with information that an email has been viewed, but we will not be able to identify the visit with your browser.
  * _User Surveys_ : Your participation in surveys is optional, although we may require your participation as a condition to a trial use of our software. We use this information to help us improve our software, plan marketing initiatives, and develop new products that may interest you. 
  * _Shopping Cart_ : We use cookies to identify you as a previous visitor to our Web site and keep track of items in your shopping cart. We may tie the cookie to any personal information we have about you.

We may also use your personal information to inform you of special offers, upgrades and other Ipswitch products and services that may be of interest to you. We may also provide you with materials concerning the products and/or services of other third parties we think may be of interest to you.

**SHARING OF INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES**

If you provide personal information to Ipswitch, you agree and consent to Ipswitch’s storage and usage of this information anywhere that Ipswitch and its affiliates maintain offices (around the world), for a variety of purposes, including those described here.

This may include exchanging information with law enforcement agencies, or with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
  * To persons who help us provide our products and services to you. Ipswitch stores the personal data of customers and web site visitors indefinitely and may maintain and process such information directly or indirectly in one or more databases in the United States or elsewhere. We may provide personal and other information to third parties who work for us, such as companies that verify credit card information, process credit card payments, fulfill orders, provide customer service, analyze customer data, remove repetitive information from customer lists, and provide marketing services. Any such company or third party is required to maintain the confidentiality of that information and is prohibited from using that information for any purpose other than as authorized by us. 
  * As part of a sale of our assets or a merger of our company. We may in the future sell all or part of our assets or be involved in a merger. It is customary for user information to be included with the transferred assets in these types of transactions.
  * To the Bureau of Export Administration. We are required by law to furnish a report to the United States Bureau of Export Administration stating the names and addresses of all non-U.S. businesses or organizations (but not individual consumers) who purchase online or register any of our software that contains an encryption feature. 



We may share non-personally identifiable aggregate statistical information about our users with third parties.

**CERTAIN EXCEPTIONAL DISCLOSURES**

Ipswitch may also disclose such personal information if required by law or if Ipswitch believes that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process (such as a warrant, subpoena, or other court order) or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ipswitch, our customers or the public.

We do not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from such individuals. Where appropriate, Ipswitch will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on the Website. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that child should contact us at the mailing address or e-mail address listed at the bottom of this policy if he would like this information deleted from our records.
