# Internet Public Library: About the IPL

The Internet Public Library has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: http://www.ipl.org. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address may also be used to gather broad demographic information about our users. Please see our [Server Access Log Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622071625id_/http%3A//www.ipl.org/div/about/circpol.html) for more details. 

This site contains links to other sites. The Internet Public Library is not responsible for the privacy policies or content of such web sites. 

Our reference question forms ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and demographic information (like age range and profession). The visitors' contact information is used to contact visitors when necessary, such as to respond to reference questions or other comments you send to our site. We may also forward your question (including your contact information) to an [IPL partner](https://web.archive.org/div/askus/index.html#partner) when we lack the resources to answer it ourself. This site is experimental, which means it is used for research purposes in addition to providing a service for visitors. Any reference question you submit may be used for educational or research purposes, as well as for demonstrations of our question management system. Your name and identifying information including your e-mail address will be removed before being used for research and will not be supplied to any outside parties. If you DO NOT want your question included in our database, please do not submit a question. If you have previously submitted a question and would like it removed from consideration for research purposes, please [contact the IPL](https://web.archive.org/div/contact/)

Our on-line surveys are anonymous and are used to improve our site and better serve our patrons. Demographic information is collected, but we do not ask for any personally identifying information.
