# Privacy Policy - IPic Theaters

**1\. INTRODUCTION**

**1.1 The Company**

IPic - Gold Class Entertainment (“IGCE”) operates Cinemas in the US and through the operation of these cinemas, IGCE from time to time gathers information from Customers and other parties with whom we deal for a variety of reasons including, in particular, to enable us to improve the nature of the services we provide. IGCE understands individuals' concerns regarding confidentiality and takes seriously its obligations with respect to all information it gathers. This Privacy Policy outlines how IGCE deals with Personal Information.

**2\. WHY IGCE COLLECTS PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**2.1 Nature of Information**

The information IGCE collects in most cases relates to Customers but can relate to suppliers and other parties we deal with (for the purposes of this Privacy Policy all such people are described as “Customers”. Information is gathered for a range of purposes, including the provision of ongoing Customer support and the compiling of Customer databases to enable us to more accurately market our goods and services. The type of information we collect may include such things as contact details (name, physical and e-mail addresses, phone numbers, etc.), demographic information (such as zip code, age or income level), financial information (such as account or credit card numbers), buying habits, opinions, product preferences and transactional details. We may also collect the Internet Protocol address and e-mail address of visitors to our website, the e-mail addresses of those who post messages to a bulletin board (if applicable), and the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail. IGCE treats all information which is collected and identifiable as relating to an individual as Personal Information. It is this information which is described as “Personal Information” for the purposes of this Privacy Policy. In addition to Personal Information, our web servers automatically collect website usage information from Customers when they visit our website. Website usage information is anonymous information about our visitors that describes how our website is used and navigated, including the number and frequency of visitors and subscribers to each web page, their actions taken during visits to the site, and the length of their stays. Website usage information does not contain personally identifiable information.

**2.2 Collection of Information**

Where practical, Customers of IGCE may deal with IGCE on an anonymous basis. However, as a provider of a wide range of services, IGCE frequently finds that it is necessary or desirable to collect Personal Information during the course of transactions. Personal Information may be collected about Customers via the following means:

1\. (a) contest entry forms;  
2\. (b) application forms;   
3\. (c) email;   
4\. (d) websites (including in some instances cookies);   
5\. (e) online transactions;

9\. (i) Information collected from third parties.

**2.3 'Sensitive Information'**

IGCE will not ask a Customer for information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, or details of health, disability or sexual orientation, unless:

1\. (a) the Customer provides their consent;  
 2\. (b) the collection of that information is specifically authorized by law;  
 3\. (c) the collection is necessary to lessen a serious or imminent threat to the health or safety of a person; or  
 4\. (d) the collection of the information is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim.

**2.4 Customer Consent**

Wherever practical, IGCE will obtain the express consent of Customers to the collection of Personal Information. In some situations, IGCE will interpret a Customer's actions as indicating that a Customer consents to the collection of Personal Information. This may occur where the Customer has provided Personal Information for a particular purpose and that purpose cannot be achieved without IGCE making use of the Customer's Personal Information.

**2.5 What happens if Personal Information is not provided**

Where relevant, IGCE will endeavor to make Customers aware that IGCE may not be able to provide a particular service to them if Personal Information is not provided upon request.

**3\. MAINTENANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**3.1 Who may view Personal Information**

In general, only officers, employees or contractors of IGCE may view Personal Information.

IGCE will only grant access to parties other than IGCE’s officers, employees and contractors to view Personal Information where IGCE believes that access is necessary to achieve the purpose for which the Personal Information was collected.

IGCE will only disclose Personal Information to parties other than IGCE's officers, employees and contractors if:

1\. (a) that disclosure is required to give effect to the purposes for which IGCE collected the Personal Information;   
2\. (b) the Customer has consented to that disclosure;   
3\. (c) IGCE believes that the disclosure may lessen a risk of harm to the health or safety of any person;   
4\. (d) IGCE believes an unlawful activity is being undertaken and the Personal Information is disclosed as part of IGCE's investigation into this activity;
