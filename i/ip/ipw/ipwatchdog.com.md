> My hosting company collects and stores various information, but to the best of my knowledge and understanding none of the information collected is personally identifying information. The information that is collected, and to which I have access, includes: (1) the name of the domain and host from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com or princeton.edu); (2) the browser software you use and your operating system; (3) the date and time you access the site; and (4) the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to **[IPWatchdog.com](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/index.html)**.

> Information collected by my hosting company is used to measure the number of visitors, where and how visitors find out about **[IPWatchdog.com](http://www.ipwatchdog.com/index.html)** , and daily traffic. I do not consider these and other general Web site statistics to be confidential.

> 
> To the best of my knowledge and understanding the company I use to conduct survey questions ( **[Surveymonkey.com](http://www.surveymonkey.com/home.asp)** ) does not collect any personally identifiable information about any visitors. Notwithstanding, I have set up the surveys such that only the first response will be counted. This will prevent one or more individuals from skewing the data set by voting multiple times. In order to accomplish this a cookie is placed on the users computer that will identify that a particular computer has already responded to a particular survey question.

> 
> You have the freedom to select what if any personally identifiable information is sent to me when you send an e-mail or through an online form. Those who submit an online form should know that the company I use to power the forms ( **[I-Depth.com](http://www.i-depth.com/)** ) forwards the form to me. To the best of my knowledge and understanding they do not collect or keep any personally identifiable information, but rather merely act as a conduit.
