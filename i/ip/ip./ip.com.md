# Privacy Policy | IP.com

This policy discloses the information practices for IP.com on the web, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

In general, you can visit IP.com on the Internet without telling us who you are and without providing any personal information. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you. By providing this information, you are giving us explicit consent to use your personal information in the ways described below.

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription to our services. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have his or her permission to do so.

We may use personal information that is coupled with general information and performance data to improve your experience on our site by providing you with information that is relevant to you. We may also use personal information that we collect to provide you with information about other products or services offered by IP.com. If you do not wish to receive these kinds of communications, then you can opt-out by contacting us. Please allow a reasonable amount of time for us to process your request.

While we will take all reasonable steps to protect your personal information, no set of security safeguards is guaranteed to be impenetrable. We cannot and do not guarantee the security of any personal information you disclose online. As noted above, we collect the information mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some IP.com pages use cookies, sent by IP.com or its third-party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the website. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some websites may not work properly.

If you turn off cookies, other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded.

This privacy policy does not apply to information that is publicly available as made in patent filings and other public repositories.
