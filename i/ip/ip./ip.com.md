# Privacy Policy - IP.com

Your privacy is important to IP.com. This statement discloses the information practices for IP.com on the web, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. 

In general, you can visit IP.com on the Internet without telling us who you are and without giving any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we or our partners may need information from you. 

You may choose to give us personal information in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us information, such as your name and address or e-mail ID, to correspond with you, to process an order, or to provide you with a subscription to our services. You may give us your credit card details to buy something from us. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes. If you give us personal information about somebody else, such as a spouse or work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so. 

The following paragraphs describe in more detail how IP.com may use your personal information and with whom we may share it. Depending on the type of IP.com Web site you are visiting, one or more of the paragraphs may apply. 

If you request something from an IP.com Web site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, other parts of IP.com, IP.com's Business Partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes. 

The information you provide to IP.com on certain IP.com Web sites may also be used by IP.com and selected third parties for marketing purposes. Before we use it, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. 

We sometimes collect non-identifiable information from visits to our Web sites to help us provide better customer service. For example, we may keep track of the domains from which people visit, and we also measure visitor activity on IP.com Web sites, but we do so in ways that keep the information non-identifiable. This information is sometimes known as "clickstream data." IP.com or others on IP.com's behalf may use this data to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service. 

Also, when we collect personal data from you in a transaction, we may extract some information about that transaction in a non-identifiable format and combine it with other non-identifiable information such as clickstream data. This information is used and analyzed only at an aggregate level to help us understand trends and patterns. This information is not reviewed at an individual level. If you do not want your transaction details used in this manner you can disable your cookies. 

We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its quality. We implement appropriate measures and processes, such as using encryption when transmitting certain sensitive information, to help us to keep your information secure and to maintain its quality. 

In some cases IP.com uses suppliers to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is IP.com's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with IP.com's policies. 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, IP.com decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise re-organize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is IP.com's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

We collect the information mentioned in the previous paragraphs through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as an anonymous tag that identifies your computer but not you. Some IP.com pages use cookies, sent by IP.com or its third party vendors, or other technologies to better serve you when you return to the Web site. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some Web sites may not work properly. 

If you turn off cookies, other technologies will still detect visits to these pages, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with other non-identifiable cookie information and are disregarded. 

Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. 

If you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to IP.com or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like us to correct it [contact us](http://ip.com/contact/). 

Before IP.com is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will respond to your requests as quickly as possible. If you have a question about this statement, you can [contact us](http://ip.com/contact/).
