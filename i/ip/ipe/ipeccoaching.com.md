## iPEC Privacy & Disclosure Statement

iPEC is committed to protecting your privacy and to implementing technology that provides the most powerful and secure online experience. Information that you share with iPEC Coaching will be held as private in accordance with the privacy policy as stated in the iPEC Privacy & Disclosure statement. Personal information is not required when browsing the public portion of iPEC websites but is required when iPEC services are requested.

## Our Commitment to Protecting Your Privacy

Protecting your privacy is of paramount important to us! We really mean that! As Coaches, we understand that what you want to discuss with us might be sensitive information specific to your unique situation. Please be assured that any conversation you have with us is respected as a confidential coaching conversation. iPEC strictly protects the security of personal information and carefully protects it from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Personal information is never shared outside iPEC without prior permission, except under conditions explained herein. The data is stored in limited-access, password-controlled computer servers.

We will treat YOU, and your private information, the way WE would want to be treated.

**Personal information collected by iPEC is most often used:**

so we can email you the information, or event registration, that you requested  
so we can reach out to ensure you received the information you requested  
so we can reach out and answer your question(s)

**iPEC uses your personal information for these primary purposes:**

  1. Create and deliver content relevant to you
  2. Ensure you received the information you requested, schedule the session you requested with an Admissions Coach and answer any question(s) you might have
  3. We may also use your personal, demographic and profile data to improve our site, for statistical analysis, for marketing and promotional purposes (both via email and through using your email address for targeting on sites such as Facebook.com), and for editorial or feedback purposes.
  4. Information collected by us may be added to our databases and used for future marketing, by phone, SMS text-messaging, e-mails, display and native advertising or postal mailings regarding site updates, new products and services, upcoming events, and/or status of orders placed online.
  5. A real person, a trained iPEC Coach employed by iPEC, will make a good faith attempt to contact you to ensure you received the information you requested and answer any questions you might have. We do NOT utilize tele-marketers.



By using this site, you agree that you may be contacted in any manner contemplated in this section even if your number is found on a do not call registry, in-house list or similar registry.

**We automatically collect and/or track the following:**

Web page http headers (home server domain names, IP address, type of client computer, and type of Web browser);

information knowingly provided by you through on-line forms, registration forms, surveys, and/or other entries, such as email addresses, personal, and demographic information;

information, user specific or aggregate, on what pages our visitors access.

## iPEC Generated Emails

iPEC will send emails providing information about the professional skill set of coaching related to Coach Training and, if available, any tuition reduction currently available. You always have the right to unsubscribe from these emails.

## Disclosure

A real person, a trained iPEC Coach employed by iPEC, will make a good faith attempt to contact you to ensure you received the information you requested and answer any questions you might have. If you answer when we call, you will always have the opportunity to speak with a trained iPEC Coach! In the event you do not answer, and we get your voicemail, you might receive a pre-recorded message. The iPEC Coach Training Program is extremely comprehensive and popular and receives over 2,000 inquiries per month. For that reason, we make every best effort to personally connect with you but sometimes, our voices get tired… so when an answering machine answers our call, occasionally we might leave you a pre-recorded message. We want to be completely transparent and let you know so you understand we are doing our best to connect with everyone who wants to connect with us. With over 2,000 inquiries per month about our program, we make every best effort to save our voices for our conversations with our prospective students.

iPEC also occasionally hires independent companies to provide limited services that may include sending you a survey pertinent to your experience with iPEC. The only information provided to those companies is limited to information needed to deliver their particular service and cannot be used for any other purpose. iPEC wants to ensure that when we are reaching out, we are meeting or exceeding your needs and therefore, we want to make every best effort to not annoy you. By asking about your experience with us, we are better able to make sure we fall on the side of ‘helpful’ instead of ‘annoying.’

iPEC will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on iPEC or the site, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of iPEC and its affiliates and subsidiaries, and (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of iPEC, its affiliates and subsidiaries, its websites, or the public.

If you have any questions regarding information explained on this page, please contact us at [admissions@ipeccoaching.com](mailto:admissions@ipeccoaching.com).

Thank you for your understanding!

Wishing you a life, and profession, of your choosing,  
The iPEC Team
