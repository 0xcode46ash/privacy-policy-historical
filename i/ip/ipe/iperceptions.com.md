# iPerceptions Privacy Statement

**Overview**

iPerceptions Inc. ("iPerceptions") recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of all respondents to our on-line surveys. Your privacy is fundamental and essential to ensure the validity of our survey process. We are committed to uphold the principles of honesty and integrity with all respondents to our surveys. It is your opinion that is requested, not your identity.

iPerceptions does not collect any information to be used to identify an individual respondent during the course of a survey. If an incentive award is offered to complete a survey questionnaire, iPerceptions acts solely as an agent of the website owner whose website is being surveyed (the "Owner"). As the Owner's agent, iPerceptions collects only the information necessary to deliver the incentive award. When offered, it is completely optional as to whether you elect to receive the incentive award. See below for details on Contact Information.
