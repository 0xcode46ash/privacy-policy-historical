# Privacy Policy | Ivy Exec

### Privacy Statement

Ivy Exec is committed to respecting the privacy of our users and providing a safe and secure experience for all professionals and employers. Please read the following to learn about the ways in which we collect and use your information. Ivy Exec contains links to other Web sites over which we have no control. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other Web sites to which you choose to link from our Sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of those other Web sites so you can understand how they collect, use and share your information.

### Disclosure of Personal Information

We do not share or sell your personal information to third parties - ever. Although we may disclose information about the use of our Web sites, that information does not contain Personal Information. Generally, we do not disclose Personal Information to third parties. However, we may share Personal Information with our contractors and service providers in order to maintain, enhance, or add to the functionality of the Web sites. If Ivy Exec becomes part of another organization, that organization will possess the Personal Information collected by IvyExec.com and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We use other third parties to provide Web analytics on our site. When you sign up for IvyExec.com, we will share aggregate click data as necessary for the third party to provide that service. These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

### Our Use of Information

The personal contact information (i.e. street address, phone number, email address) that you provide in this registration process is confidential. We will use your personal information for internal purposes only and will never sell or share your personal information with any third parties. Should you fill out a registration form, the amount of information you choose to keep confidential is entirely up to your discretion. You may enter as much or as little information as you choose. All information posted will only be viewable by registered user on the Ivy Exec website. All employers and professionals are screened before they are given access to the database.

In your use of the site, we store such information as jobs you've applied to, jobs you've viewed, your resume, and similar information. We use this information for our internal purposes and do not share it with any third parties.

We use Pay Pal to provide credit card processing services on our site. For more information on PayPal's privacy policy, click here.

If you choose to use IvyExec.com's invitation service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for information needed to send the invitation, such as your friend's email address. If you choose to import your friend's information, IvyExec.com will not store your password after importing your friend's information. We will send your friend an email in your name inviting him or her to visit the site, and may send up to three reminders to them. Your friend may contact us at http://www.ivyexec.com:8080/remove to request that we remove this information from our database.

### Internet Protocol Address

Like most websites, we collect Internet Protocol ("IP") address from all visitors to the Web site. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. We use IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server, administer our Web site, analyze trends, track users' movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use in order for us to improve the Web site, and deliver customized, personalized content.

### Other Web sites

Our Web site contains links to other Web sites. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are entering another website over which IvyExec.com has no control and will bear no responsibility. Often these sites require you to enter your personal information as you apply for a job directly with the hiring company. We encourage you to read the privacy statements on all such Web sites as their policies may differ from ours.

### Security

IvyExec.com has implemented and follows industry standard measures to protect against unauthorized access to and unlawful interception or processing of Personal Information. We also protect account information by placing it on a secure portion of our Web site that is only accessible by certain qualified employees of Ivy Exec. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your Personal Information, we cannot ensure or warranty the security of any such Personal Information. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

### Legal Disclaimer

We may disclose your Personal Information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on IvyExec.com. As such, we cannot ensure that your Personal Information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, we may be legally obligated to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may circumvent our security measures to unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.
