# IrishJobs.ie Privacy Policy

****  
**Overview**  
****  
  
IrishJobs.ie is fully committed to protecting the privacy of the users of our Site. This Policy outlines this commitment to you, as we want to be able to provide you with a user experience that is safe and secure. We want to ensure to our best efforts that any information you give us remains private and is used only for the purposes outlined in this Policy. Please note that by using our site, you acknowledge that you agree with the terms of our Privacy Policy. 

A user can access our website, IrishJobs.ie (the 'site') and utilise many of our services without providing any information to us at all. Nor do we follow a user's browsing path outside of our site. We do develop summary - not individual - reports for our recruiters and advertisers.   
  
****  
**Aggregated Information on all users of IrishJobs.ie**  
****  
  
We gather information on all users of our site on an aggregated basis. This information is used to analyse what the total usage levels are for the Site, what areas of the site are most popular and what times of the day are most popular for using the site. This information is used to help us decide what improvements we can make to the Site going forward. In addition, we may share this information with our clients or potential clients and our partners, but only on an aggregated basis with no individual breakdown, so they receive no information about how you, as an individual, use the site, nor will they be able to identify you personally from the information they receive.  
  
****  
**Information about you specifically**  
****  
  
In some situations, you may wish to register with IrishJobs.ie, e.g. to set-up a 'My Career Manager' account. This will involve you registering personal information such as your name and email address. The information is collected solely for the purpose of personalising your user experience and for delivering the services that you have signed up for. If, at any time, you do not wish to remain a registered user, you can un-subscribe and/or delete your personal information from our databases.  
IrishJobs.ie offers you the ability to change at any time the personal information you give during registration..

**Cookies**  
****  
  
A cookie is a small piece of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information back from the browser. The IrishJobs.ie site uses cookies to identify users and personalise their visit by customising web pages for them. For this reason, some pages may not display correctly if you have disabled cookies on your browser. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. 

  
  
  
****  
**Information that is logged on an automatic basis**  
****  
  
We use your IP address, log user agents and referring address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our site and to identify unique users.

We will not monitor, edit, or disclose any personal information about you or your internet use without your prior permission unless we believe that such action is required to enforce the law. In this case, data may be passed on to appropriate individuals, organisations or companies, if specifically requested.   


  
  
  
****  
**CVs**  
****  
  
On IrishJobs.ie you may decide to register your CV in our database. This means that your CV can be found and viewed by recruiters who have paid for access to our CV Database product. It also means that you can attach it to your online job application. 

You may store your CV in the database. However, your personal identifying details (name, address & email) will not be visible to any recruiter or employer who may access your CV when they search the database. We endeavour to grant access to the CV database only to recruiters who agree to abide by our Terms and Conditions. However, should a third party gain access to your CV by evading our security measures, we cannot be held responsible. 

You may remove your CV from our database at any time. However, recruiters who have already accessed your CV, may have kept a copy of it in their own files. Please note that we cannot be held responsible for the retention, use, or privacy of your CV in these instances. 

In the interest of your privacy and the maintenance of an up-to-date CV database, CVs are removed from recruiters' access if they have not been updated for a period of 90 days. If you wish your CV to remain in the searchable database, you must update your details at least once every 90 days.  


  
  
  
****  
**Job Alert service**  
****  
  
The Job Alert service matches a jobseeker's requirements for employment with the profile of vacancies advertised on our site. For jobseekers who subscribe to this service, you receive an email listing those jobs that match the criteria you have entered for, by at least 50% based on our ranking system. You decide how often you wish to receive these alerts and you can change your search criteria at any time or unsubscribe at any time.   
  
****  
**Career Update service**  
****  
  
The Career Update service offers users the ability to register to receive a monthly email detailing career information and site service information. You can unsubscribe from this at any time.  
  
****  
**Application information:**  
****  
  
If you apply for a vacancy advertised on IrishJobs.ie, that is understood to be permission by you to forward your personal details to that recruiter for that vacancy.  
  
****  
**Site Update information**  
****  
  
We may, at any time, contact, via email, registered users, to inform them of service issues and/or upgrade to the site.   
  
****  
**External Links and other sites**  
****  
  
This site contains links to other websites. In addition, IrishJobs.ie provides certain services in conjunction with third parties. IrishJobs.ie is not responsible for the content of any third party website or website to which we have links or for the privacy or security practices of such websites.   
  
****  
**Candidate Manager**  
****  
  
Candidate Manager is online recruitment management software licensed by a separate division of IrishJobs.ie to third party clients for the purposes of administrating candidate CVs the client receives via IrishJobs.ie and/or other websites which may or may not include the client's own website. 

The Candidate Manager IT team can only access individual recruiter accounts which include candidate information for Technical Support purposes, via a separate password which is fully traceable. 

In relation to IT performance issues, the Candidate Manager division of IrishJobs.ie cannot take responsibility for any IT faults which arise on the applicant or recruiter side during the application or processing of CVs.   


  
  
  
****  
**Security**  
****  
  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, IrishJobs.ie cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. Firewalls, Intrustion Detection and Virus Scanners are used on all parts of the site. Encryption during transmission is also used on sections of the site where security is particularly important. 

  
  
  
****  
**Changes to our Privacy Policy**  
****  
  
IrishJobs.ie reserves the right to change or remove this Privacy Policy at its discretion and will post any new Privacy Policy here. Therefore we would encourage you to visit this area frequently to stay informed. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy you can email us at [info@irishjobs.ie ](mailto:info@irishjobs.ie)
