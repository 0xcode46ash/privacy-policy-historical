## International Rectifier Privacy Statement

**Privacy**

Visitors are welcome to IR's general web site while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personally identifying information. In addition, there are portions of this Web site where we may need to collect personal information from you for a specific purpose. Sharing your personally identifying information is strictly voluntary. 

**Use of Collected Information**   
When you visit IR's site as an anonymous user the domain name information that we collect is not used to personally identify you and instead is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. We use this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site. 

When you request information or try to access a secured area we may ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, telephone number or physical location. Sharing this information with IR will allow us to: 

  * Send you IR's e-mail newsletter for the areas you selected. The option to update your selections or remove yourself from email news updates is available at all times. 
  * Create a personal home page to share secure information about purchases you have made on IR's website. 
  * Provide you with requested information or materials about IR's products. 



**Disclosure to Third Parties**   
Under certain circumstances, personally identifying information may be given to IR's sales affiliates or distributors when we believe your business interests will be served. On occasion IR will contract with 3rd party vendors to provide services or products. These vendors are not authorized by IR to sell, lease or share any information with other parties. 

**Links to Other Sites**   
IR's Web site may contain links to other sites such as distributors and sales affiliates. While we try to link only to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we are not responsible for the content, security, or privacy practices employed by other sites. 

**Security of Collected Information**   
We maintain strict physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. We restrict access to information about you to those IR employees who need to know the information to respond to your inquiry or request. Workers who misuse personal information are subject to disciplinary action. 

**Cookies**   
International Rectifier is committed to continually improving the Web experience for our visitors. Currently, cookies are the most effective way of identifying a unique, anonymous visitor and their navigation during a visit. A "cookie" is a text file that is sent by a web server and stored in RAM while the browser is running so that it can be read back from that browser the next time a unique visitor returns to that web server. Companies commonly use cookies for on-line ordering systems, site personalization, and Web site tracking. Cookies allow the browser to "remember" specific information about the visitor such as last visit, time spent, or user preferences (like style sheets). When visitors to the site run into browser or HTML problems, cookies allow us to isolate their specific session in our visitor log files. This information helps to replicate the environment and isolate the problem. Cookies and registration are two methods that allow International Rectifier to offer more features to repeat visitors/customers. International Rectifier uses cookie information to understand usage patterns, to offer personalized features, or to isolate problems experienced by our users as they traverse our site. We do not use cookies for any other purpose. International Rectifier cookies are terminated when a visitor ends their browser session. However, cookies may also be stored on your computer's hard drive once you log off from our Web site.
