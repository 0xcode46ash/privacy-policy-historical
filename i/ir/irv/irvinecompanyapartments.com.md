### A. Personal Information

The personal information that Irvine collects about you may include, without limitation, your first and last name, home address, email address, home telephone number, mobile telephone number, employer name, work address, gender, Social Security number, password, credit or debit card number, or other payment method, billing and shipping information, order history, preferences for products, shopping and entertainment, and financial information that is not otherwise publicly available.

Irvine collects personal information about you whenever you transact business with Irvine, use Irvine’s products or services, rent, lease or purchase property from Irvine, request information or materials, enter sweepstakes, contests or drawings offered by Irvine, create or update a profile, place orders or make purchases, communicate with us about orders or other questions, or visit the Websites. When you register to request information on a Website or make purchases on a Website, for example, you submit personal information. Once you use these features of the Website, you are not anonymous to us.

Irvine also may acquire personal information from publicly available sources, social media platforms, and vendors and other third parties that may share information as permitted in their privacy policies.

Irvine may combine personal information collected as described above with information available from other sources (such as offline records or publicly available information). If the combined information permits us to contact you online or offline, we will treat the combined information as personal information.

### B. Non-Personal Information

Non-personal information refers to data and information that (i) is aggregated (that is, relates to a group of individuals) by Irvine or a third party (“aggregated non-personal information”), or (ii) is not linked to personal contact information (“de-identified non-personal information”). In either case, non-personal information does not personally identify the individual to whom the information or data collected relates.

Non-personal information may include, without limitation, your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, your media access control (MAC) address, Collection Technology information (as described below), the pages you request, type of computer or device you use, the operating system you use (e.g., Microsoft Windows, Mac OS or Google Chrome OS), the type of browser you use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer or Safari), the domain name of the Internet service provider, your activities while visiting or using the Websites and the content you access or view, the time of your visit to or use of the Websites, the webpages you visit and the time spent on the webpages, your general geographic location such as the city from which your computer or device is connecting to the Internet, your computer's or device's precise geographic location when Wi-Fi is enabled and it is within range of or using Internet connectivity made available by Irvine, information regarding the websites you visit prior to and after visiting the Websites, information regarding your Internet location when you see Irvine’s ads and whether you click on such ads, information regarding your age, gender and interests with respect to products and services and information collected through our security systems and cameras.

Irvine automatically receives and records non-personal information on our server logs from your browser as well as through other analysis of the Websites. Irvine also may obtain non-personal information from you when you visit our offline locations, as well as from social media platforms, vendors and other third parties, such as Google, Inc. (“Google”) and the operators of other websites or applications that run on mobile devices and tablets (“applications”) that you have visited, some of which partner with Irvine or with a display network utilized by Irvine, and may share information as permitted in such third party’s privacy policy. Non-personal information may also be obtained from inferences based upon the sites you visit, third party data, information you share on other websites, social media platforms and applications, or demographics derived from profiles you create, such as a Google profile.

**i. Cookies and other “Collection Technology”**

Non-personal information may be collected in a variety of ways, but Collection Technology is often used. “Collection Technology” refers to cookies, web beacons, pixels, gifs, tags and other technologies that collect information in similar ways. Collection Technology such as a cookie may store a piece of data on your browser or device, while other forms of Collection Technology may identify your browser or device and/or collect information through other means. When you visit the Websites or another website or application where an Irvine ad appears, your browser or device may be exposed to Collection Technology and Collection Technology may be stored on your browser or device, which may provide Irvine with non-personal information about you.

You may delete and/or refuse the use of certain Collection Technologies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser. You may use the Websites even if you choose to refuse or delete such Collection Technologies; however please note that this may affect your ability to use the full functionality of the Websites.

**ii. Google Analytics**

The Websites use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics uses Collection Technology to collect and store anonymous information about you, which may include the non-personal information described above. You can read Google Analytics’ privacy policy at <http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html> and Google Analytics Terms of Use at <http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html>. The Websites use these features of Google Analytics:

(a) “Demographics and Interest Reporting” to analyze information regarding the interests and demographics of users of the Websites. Irvine uses such non-personal information in the same manner as Irvine uses other non-personal information as described below.

(b) “Remarketing with Google Analytics” to place ads on other sites directed to people who have visited the Websites.

(c) “Google Display Network Impression Reporting” to report how people’s interactions with Irvine ads relate to their visits to the Websites.

You can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads by changing the ad settings [here](https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCh4HAtjShL0Fdg63jzwho_phMSA0-0hzzH5ELDtoQ4xvNARM3etqnH1cOQWE6jmaavbHAbbDNQ0VerqrM5EhrZPUq-63xzTlHosNHcmK0aXN4mlgTrjMz0kkR9jDjb517T55jzNvxLzRysnxsAR_ppR2CwKxxB9HGFk7nx48LTrKMNPSF2b4FHwjiQFue_I4bivF%27%20target=).

### 13\. Changes To This Privacy Policy

The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy (“Last Revised Date”) for you to know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy practices. Each time you access, use or browse the Websites, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.

Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after the Last Revised Date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.

Irvine may limit a Website’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time in its sole discretion.

Personal information collected through the Websites and other aspects of Irvine’s business may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Irvine or its affiliates, subsidiaries or Service Providers maintain facilities.
