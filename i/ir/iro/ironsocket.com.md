### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs, and similar technologies to understand how users access and use our Site. By accepting this Policy, you agree that we may place cookies on your computer. For more information about cookies, please visit [aboutcookies.org](http://aboutcookies.org/).

The Company uses both session ID cookies and persistent cookies as part of its interaction with your browser. A cookie is an alphanumeric identifier (a file) that the Company's web sites transfer to your computer's hard drive through a web browser to enable its systems to recognize your browser for record-keeping purposes. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser, while a persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time.

We use "session ID cookies" to allow our system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to your account at the Site. Session ID cookies are used to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and for us to deliver the Services ordered. We may use "persistent cookies" to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity and to administrate our affiliate program. We may also use persistent cookies in areas of the Site where you are able to customize the information you see, so that you don't have to enter your preferences more than once.

By configuring the options in your browser, you may control how cookies are processed by your system. However, if you decline the use of cookies you may not be able to use certain features on this Site.

Some of the Company's business partners (e.g., third party advertisers) may use cookies on the site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. Accordingly, this Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by the Company only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

We currently use the following:

  * **Google Analytics cookies:** These cookies allow us to count page visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site, using a service provided by Google Analytics. For more information visit: [http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html;](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html)
  * **Affiliate cookies:** These cookies allow us to identify if you have been referred to us by an affiliate, so we can pay commission to that affiliate;
  * **Login cookies:** We use these cookies so you remain logged in when you are using your account;
  * **Clear GIFs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs).** We or the third parties we engage may employ clear GIFs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site by among other things, tracking the activities of our Site visitors and compiling statistics about Site usage. Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages or within emails. We do not provide these third parties with any personal information that we have collected about you.

  


### Security Measures

  * We use encryption, access controls, passwords, and physical security measures;
  * All information is in electronic format, securely stored in our databases;
  * All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices; and
  * Access to user or subscriber personal information is restricted to those who need to know such information to perform their job functions.

By using the Site, you consent to any such transfer, storage and processing of information outside of your country.
