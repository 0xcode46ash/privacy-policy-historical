# Privacy Policy » IRONMAN.com

As stated above, Ironman.com does not solicit any personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. Please review our Note to Parents, if you have any questions regarding our Policy with respect to children. 

Ironman.com does not collect personally identifiable information through the site unless you provide that information during registration for various features on the site (e.g., Ironman.com personalization, newsletters, purchases on the Ironmanstore.com on Ironman.com, Sweepstakes etc.). Information required to participate in such features may vary but will typically include your first and last name; address including city, state, zip code and country; complete date of birth; and e-mail address; and, in the case of making purchases, a credit card number and expiration date. You may also be requested to provide a username and password for certain features. Ironman.com will maintain all of the personal information submitted by you in secured servers behind corporate firewalls.

 **2\. The organization collecting the information**

Ironman.com is operated by World Triathlon Corporation. World Triathlon Corporation is located at 2701 North Rocky Point Drive Suite 1250, Tampa, FL 33607. 

You can also learn more about any of the Qualifying Ironman Races by referring to their respective Official Web Sites located on Ironman.com.

3\. How the information is used

Ironman.com may use information provided at registration or information obtained through third parties to offer better targeted products and services to you. We use targeting to customize and enhance your online experience on the site. The use of information provided at registration or obtained through third parties will not be provided to advertisers or partners, except in aggregate form, unless you have consented to such use at registration.

Ironman.com uses "cookie" technology. Cookies are pieces of information transferred to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Such technology is an industry standard and is used by most major Web sites. Ironman.com will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie. In order to effectively use the site and some of its features (e.g., Advertising personalization, Ironmanstore.com on Ironman.com), your browser must accept cookies.

Users should be aware that Ironman.com cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for Ironman.com. If a user does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept cookies; however, users should note that cookies may be necessary to provide the user with certain features available on Ironman.com.

Ironman.com tracks certain general usage pattern information, including what pages people visit and how long they have been registered users. Ironman.com may log users' IP addresses (the group of four numbers separated by periods, such as 123.45.64.89, that identifies a particular host computer) for the purposes of system administration, site tracking and reporting of aggregate usage information to our marketing and product development teams.

From time to time, Ironman.com may solicit your opinion to determine your preferences and dislikes in order to provide you with a better product. These surveys are always optional to the user and your decision not to participate in a survey will not affect your status as an Ironman.com user. Should you choose to participate, any information you give us may be used in aggregate form for marketing purposes, and to enhance your overall experience on our site.

4\. With whom the information may be shared

Once again, Ironman.com will not provide any personally identifiable information, other than to its affiliates, about you to advertisers or other partners without your consent. As stated above, Ironman.com may, however, provide advertisers and/or other partners with anonymous aggregated information about our users to illustrate trends and patterns. All third parties with whom we share such information will have independent privacy and data collection practices and Ironman.com has no responsibility or liability for their policies or actions.

We will never give out any information linking your real name to your screen name unless you authorize us to do so, or unless required to do so by law.

Ironman.com has several partners that can offer valuable products and services to our members. From time to time, Ironman.com may give or sell a list from our database of users to these third party vendors. These lists will consist of only those users that have "opted in" to receiving special offers and promotions during the initial registration process. Ironman.com will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that every marketing offer sent to an Ironman.com user as a result of the provision of such information contains a link for that user to no longer receive such offers. In addition, we may share your information with a company that acquires all or substantially all of Ironman.com's assets or in a merger or acquisition, but only if such company agrees to abide by this Privacy Policy.

While Ironman.com is careful in choosing its partners and advertisers, we are only responsible for content on our own site. All third parties associated with Ironman.com (including, but not limited to, advertisers, sponsors and other Internet sites) with whom we share information have independent privacy and data collection practices. Ironman.com does not control this collection of information and is neither responsible nor liable for their independent policies or actions.

Ironman.com uses DoubleClick, a reputable third party vendor, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our site. If you would like to know more about the information gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of our third party ad server, please Click Here.

5\. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information

You are not required to receive any mailings that you do not wish to receive. During the registration process, you will have the option to sign up to receive newsletters and selected sponsor offers and discounts. You will not receive such information if you do not select such options. If, after you choose to receive such information, you wish to discontinue receiving these items, you may change your subscription preferences by following the instructions provided within the e-mails received.

6\. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control

Ironman.com has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control. The servers for Ironman.com are stored in a physically secure and climate controlled off-site facility. Beyond the physical protection of the servers, we protect against data loss by regularly backing up data, performing consistency checks with independently recorded log files to prevent tampering, and restricting access to information on our servers via several user authentication technologies. Our site uses SSL or "Secure Sockets Layer", an industry standard security protocol. When you place an order on the site and your credit card information is transmitted, you will connect with our secure server. SSL sends your browser information that encrypts your order, changing all the information that you send back into a code that is extremely difficult to decipher.

Only those employees needed to carry out the business functions will have access to information on individual Ironman.com customers. We train each such employee with respect to the Ironman.com Privacy Policy, and those violating these policies will be subject to disciplinary action.

It is important to remember that whatever you transmit or disclose online can be collected and used by others or unlawfully intercepted by third parties. No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. In addition, we may disclose information to law enforcement or other government officials if we determine such disclosure to be appropriate, or if we are compelled to disclose it by court order or operation of law.

Any information voluntarily disclosed by users and posted on our site (on message boards and/or in chat areas) may be viewed and used by others. If users post personal information that is accessible to the public online, the user does so at his or her own risk. Users accept that they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return.

IRONMAN.COM NOTES TO PARENTS  
It is Ironman.com's policy not to solicit any personally identifiable information from children. A number of interactive features on Ironman.com require registration to participate (e.g., e-mail newsletters, Sweepstakes, etc.). All registrants will be required to enter their full name, age, zip code and e-mail address. In some cases, users will be required to select a special user name to be used as an identifier for the feature and must also enter a password and a secret hint that will help us verify their identity if they forget their password. If Ironman.com determines that a person is under the age of 13, based on the information provided during the registration process, that person will not be permitted to register for features requiring the submission of personal information, in accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. Instead, when a child under 13 years old tries to register for such features on Ironman.com, he or she will be directed to content which does not involve the submission of personal information. Any personally identifiable information that the child may have attempted to enter during the registration process will not be collected or maintained by Ironman.com. Children who indicate that they are under 13 years old will not be able to make credit card purchases or participate in interactive features on Ironman.com that involve the collection and retention of personal information (e.g., entering a sweepstakes).

Ironman.com works with (and may provide links to) third party sites that offer features described on Ironman.com. Such third parties may permit children under the age of 13 to register for these features on their sites in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Registration for these features is pursuant to the privacy policies of the third parties operating the websites on which registration occurs. For more information, please review the privacy policies of each respective third party site. Ironman.com does not knowingly obtain, retain or use information from anyone who indicates that they are under 13 years old.
