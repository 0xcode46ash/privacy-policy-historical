In the event that any inconsistencies should arise with respect to this policy and the Privacy Principles concerning online privacy, the terms of this policy shall prevail.

Please read this policy carefully to learn how you can verify the accuracy of any personally identifiable information we have concerning you and how you can request that Iron Mountain delete or update your information.

**What information do we ask you to submit?**

In order to accommodate your information request, we ask you to submit your name, title, company affiliation (if any), mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address. At your option, you may also provide us with the best time at which to contact you and other relevant comments [if a comment field exists for the information you have requested].

**Do we use cookies and other tracking mechanisms?**

When you visit this site, information about your browser type, operating system, IP address, and the domain name from which you access this site (e.g., yahoo.com) is collected. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the number of times you have visited the site, the date you visited the site, and the amount of time you spent viewing the site. This information is used solely for our internal purposes in managing the site and improving its functionality.

If you have selected the "Choose a Country" button, your country and language preferences will be saved via the use of a cookie that will be used to identify you when you return to the site. Cookies are blocks of data that are placed on your computer and that are sent by your Web browser to our computer when you visit this site. The cookies that are placed on your computer have unlimited duration. If you delete or otherwise choose not to use cookies, you will still be able to use our site, but you will need to re-select any preferences that you previously made (such as language and country).

**To whom do we disclose your information?**

Subject to applicable law, we and our service providers (as defined below) disclose and share your personal information: 

  * Among Iron Mountain and its Affiliates;
  * To unaffiliated third parties that are under contract to perform services for or on behalf of Iron Mountain ( _Service Providers_ ), and are required to uphold and maintain policies with respect to privacy and the treatment of your personally identifiable information (e.g., vendors hosting the investor relations or DSI Technology Escrow aspects of this Web site);
  * To a third party in connection with a proposed or actual sale, merger, or transfer of all or a portion of a business or division; and 
  * To other persons as permitted or required by applicable law or regulation. 

Any access to such information will be limited to the purpose for which such information was provided to us or our Service Providers. Iron Mountain, its Affiliates and Service Providers are located throughout the world. Accordingly, your information may be sent to countries which have a different level of privacy protection than the United States of America ( _USA_ ) or your country of residence. For instance, if you inquire about services Iron Mountain provides in France and in Brazil, Iron Mountain will forward your inquiry to the Iron Mountain location in such countries. Iron Mountain will, at your request, provide you with details of companies and countries to which your information has been sent.

**Links and third-party Web sites**

This policy applies only to this Web site. This site includes links to both our Affiliated Web sites and to non-affiliated Web sites, including access to content, products and services of such Affiliated and non-affiliated sites. In some cases, these other sites are made available via "seamless experience" technology, and may appear to be part of our Web site. Although some of the entities controlling these sites are under contract with Iron Mountain, we urge you to familiarize yourself with the individual privacy and other terms for each linked Web site prior to submitting your personally identifiable information.

**How may you opt out or request changes?**

You are entitled to request that Iron Mountain:

  * provide you with a copy of your personal information that it holds; 
  * cease processing your personal information for the purposes of direct marketing;
  * correct any errors in that information; and 
  * update that information as required.

If you would like to receive a copy of the personal information we have about you as submitted to us via this Web site, or if you wish to opt out of receiving marketing related communications from us, please send a request to [webmaster@ironmountain.com](mailto:webmaster@ironmountain.com). If this information is incorrect or incomplete, please let us know, and we will make every reasonable effort to correct or update it promptly (unless we require further information from you in order to fulfill your request). You may also ask us to remove your name and other personal information from our databases. In each of the foregoing cases, we will make all reasonable efforts to honor your request promptly, subject to legal and other permissible considerations.

If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry from the [webmaster@ironmountain.com](mailto:webmaster@ironmountain.com) or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should first contact Iron Mountain’s Director of Privacy at [global.privacy@ironmountain.com](mailto:global.privacy@ironmountain.com). If you continue to have questions thereafter, then you may file a request for mediation of an online privacy issue with the American Arbitration Association at 335 Madison Avenue, 10th Floor, New York, New York 10017-4605, USA; telephone: 212-716-5800; fax: 212-716-5905 and e-mail: [website-mail@adr.org](mailto:website-mail@adr.org). Any mediation shall take place at a location mutually agreed to as being convenient to both parties; if mutual agreement cannot be achieved, then it shall take place at a location convenient to the party which did not initiate the mediation request.

**How will we notify you if this policy changes?**

Iron Mountain may, in its sole discretion, update this policy at any time and from time to time, by posting the amended policy on this Web site. If we make material changes to this policy that affect our treatment of your personal information, we will provide you with e-mail or postal mail notice and a choice to opt in under the terms of the revised policy. After the changes take effect, all newly collected personal information will be subject to the terms of the revised policy and all previously collected personal information will be handled in accordance with your response to our opt-in notice (in accordance with the revised policy if you opt in and in accordance with the previous policy if you do not opt in).

If no material changes have been made to this policy that affect our treatment of your personal information, the amended policy shall be effective upon posting, and your access to or use of the site following an update shall be deemed consent to the revised policy. If you have asked to receive marketing and other materials, and you regularly receive electronic communications from us, amendments to this policy may be sent to you via e-mail. We urge you to refer back to this page regularly and especially prior to providing any personal information via this Web site. This policy may not be otherwise amended without the written consent of Iron Mountain. **This Policy was last updated August 26, 2002.**

**How do we protect your information and where is it stored?**

Iron Mountain takes seriously the security of the information it collects. Iron Mountain has therefore implemented technology and security policies and procedures intended to reduce the risk of accidental destruction or loss, or the unauthorized disclosure or access to such information appropriate to the nature of the data concerned. In addition, Iron Mountain has certified its compliance with the Safe Harbor framework designed to satisfy the "adequacy" requirement under the European Directive on Data Protection.

Personal information which you submit via the site is stored on servers in the USA, and these servers are subject to Iron Mountain’s IT security policies and procedures. If you are located in another jurisdiction, you should be aware that your personal information once submitted will be transferred to our servers, and the USA currently does not have uniform data protection laws.

**Children**

Iron Mountain does not want to collect personal information from minors (children under 13 years of age, or any other age defined under applicable law). If we become aware that a minor is attempting to or has submitted personal information via this Web site, we will notify the user that we may not accept his or her personal information. We will then expunge any such personal information from our records.
