In particular, IronPlanet has several service partners who provide services or products and as part of such operations, these companies may be provided certain of your contact information. IronPlanet will endeavour to ensure that any third parties to whom we disclose your personal information abide by the terms of this Privacy Statement. In other instances we may be obliged to disclose your personal information in order to conform to any requirements of law or to comply with any legal process, as well as to protect and defend the rights of IronPlanet, and/or our customers.
