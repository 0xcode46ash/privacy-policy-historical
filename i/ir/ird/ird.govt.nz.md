As part of our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers we record all telephone calls answered in our contact centres. This helps us to identify ways that we can provide you with a better service. Please note that child support calls are not answered through our contact centres and so these calls may not be recorded.

Phishing is when someone tries to trick you in to disclosing your personal information and may then use or sell this information for illegal purposes such as applying for credit cards or loans in your name. We would like to know if someone unexpectedly asks for your tax information including your IRD number, password or user ID.
