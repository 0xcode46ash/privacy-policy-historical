# Internet Software Consortium - About the ISC

## ISC Privacy Statement

Internet Software Consortium provides reference implementations of protocols critical to the Internet’s core infrastructure. These implementations provide the fundamental functions of on-demand IP address assignment via DHCP, domain name resolution via BIND, and USENET Network News transport via INN. This web site provides information concerning the following topics:

  * The status of our projects
  * Obtaining our software 
  * How to obtain commercial support and consultation from ISC
  * How to subscribe to and unsubscribe from mailing lists provided for announcements and technical and/or general discussions of ISC software or other topics hosted by ISC
  * Descriptions of training courses offered and course registration procedures.



Internet Software Consortium is a not-for-profit organization and although our mission does not require our web site to collect information regarding visitors, it is effective to use aggregated information to demonstrate our value to potential sponsors and donors. Information collected on specific web visitors or subscribers on our mailing lists is not retained and all information provided to ISC will be protected from unauthorized access. In particular, any information on web visitors or mailing list subscriptions obtained by ISC will NOT be sold.

Only the minimum personal information necessary will be obtained through the ISC web sites with its intended use clearly identified. The following principles and practices are strictly adhered to with respect to user participation and/or viewing of information provided on ISC’s web site:

  * Cookie technology is not being used at our web sites to identify your viewing habits, references, or requests when they are interspersed with other requests from the same domain. 
  * ISC does not poll browsers as to which web pages they previously viewed. 
  * ISC does keep standard web log records and occasionally uses them to report to supporters the volume of accesses, and the classes of the domains where accesses originated. 
  * ISC may collect some additional information from browsers that respond to the web surveys we conduct. This information is used to prevent respondents from making multiple responses or "stuffing the ballot box." 
  * Email addresses used for passwords when FTPing source code are saved in a file, but will not be sold or used for unsolicited commercial email. 
  * ISC hosts a number of mailing lists both on ISC as well as non-ISC topics. We do not sell names from any of the mailing lists and have informed the managers of non-ISC related mailing lists that we do not allow the selling of names for lists hosted by us. All practical precautionary measures are taken to protect the privacy of all subscribers. 
  * ISC products and activities may be publicized on "announce" lists, but these lists will not be routinely available for other organizations to use for this purpose.



ISC's web pages provide links to non-ISC sites that offer complementary or similar products or services. ISC is not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites and can not be held liable for any use of private data that they may create.

Note: ISC has a no-tolerance policy with parties determined to have deliberate or malicious intent to abuse the ISC's web site or mailing lists. In such cases ISC will use whatever means it has available to identify the source of the abuse, and may refer the identification of the abusers to appropriate organizations including law enforcement and/or the Realtime Blackhole List, for appropriate action.
