#### Surveys and Contests

Occasionally, our site will request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user can choose whether or not to send in their information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   


#### How We Use Information

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals.   
Using the e-mail addresses provided on registrations, surveys, and contests, IsraelNationalNews.com will occasionally send promotional e-mail to its subscribers about services offered by our selected advertisers. All advertisers are carefully screened for suitability before we send any of their advertisements to our readership.   
Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online to send unwanted e-mail. For any list that you subscribe to we also provide you an opportunity to opt-out with every e-mail that is sent to you.  


#### IP Address 

We use your IP address solely to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. For example, your IP address will be used for us to gather broad demographic information of our readership.

#### Our Commitment To Data Security 

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems.
