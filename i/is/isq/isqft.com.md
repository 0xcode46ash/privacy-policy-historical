Information you post to a Registered User Area may be viewed, accessed, or collected by, or disclosed to, other Registered Users and may be used by other Registered Users in ways neither you nor iSqFt are able to control or predict, including, without limitation, disclosure of your information to the public or to contact you for unauthorized purposes.

With whom does iSqFt share information?

We maintain mutual sharing agreements with our strategic business partners for the express purpose of providing our joint customers with opportunities to receive information about valuable products and services. We will not disclose your personal information to any other third parties except to the extent necessary to provide you with a requested service, or under circumstances required by law. We may also share your profile information & project activity with third parties if you click on a publicly posted project or with those subscribers who created a project if you click on their privately invited project.

iSqFt may allow third parties to display advertisements on the Site. iSqFt and these third parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view and interact with these advertisements and connect to the Site.

iSqFt may use third party ad servers or vendors to serve or present the ads that appear on the Site and to conduct research about the advertisements. Any of these ad servers may collect non-personal information, such as your browser, operating system, date/time of viewing, IP address and clickstream data. The use of first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics) or third-party cookies (such as Doubleclick) help inform, optimize and serve ads based on the users past visits to the Site. iSqFt cannot control the activities of such advertisers or web sites. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT COVER THE COLLECTION AND USE OF INFORMATION BY SUCH AD SERVERS.

The Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) is a cooperative group of ad serving providers. The NAI has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere. The NAI is committed to providing consumers with clear explanations of Internet advertising practices and how they affect you and the Internet generally.

What else should I know about my privacy?

You should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information online in a public area, that information may be viewed and used by others. Furthermore, users who choose to list their profile in the iSqFt Network make that information available to subscribers who may be searching for qualified bidders.

iSqFt may disclose any information, including without limitation Personally Identifiable Information, that iSqFt deems necessary, in its sole discretion and without your prior permission, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. iSqFt also may exchange information, including without limitation Personally Identifiable Information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection, risk reduction and related activities or to protect the rights, property of safety of iSqFt and its agents, employees or affiliates or others. iSqFt reserves the right to disclose a user's Personally Identifiable Information if iSqFt believes the user is in violation of iSqFt's Terms of Use, even without a subpoena, warrant or other court order.

Please remember that you are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of any password you use on the Site.

What if I live in California?

If you are a resident of California ("California Users"), in addition to the rights set forth in this Privacy Policy, you generally have the right to request information from iSqFt regarding the manner in which iSqFt shares certain categories of Personally Identifiable Information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.

Under the law, however, a business is not required to provide this information if it adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer's personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying California Users of their rights to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right.

Please note that whenever you opt in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as iSqFt has no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how it will handle your information.

Please note that iSqFt is only required to respond to one request per customer each year. iSqFt is not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address: privacy@iSqFt.com.

When iSqFt posts changes to this Privacy Policy, iSqFt will revise the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page. iSqFt encourages you to bookmark this Privacy Policy and to periodically review it to inform yourself of changes to it or any of iSqFt's other policies. Any changes to iSqFt's Privacy Policy will become effective upon iSqFt's posting of the updated policy. Use of the Site constitutes your acceptance of the terms of this Privacy Policy then in effect.
