# Genwi - Privacy Policy

Genwi, LLC ("Genwi") recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you and is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes the measures taken by us to protect your privacy in connection with your use of www. genwi.com (our "Site").

**This policy was last modified on April 10, 2007.**

PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY USING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY.

**What information is collected by Genwi:**

When you visit our Site we will recognize and store your IP address. An Internet Protocol ("IP") address is a unique string of numbers that is assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We use your IP address to gather demographic information and measure traffic to our Site. We also use it to measure the popularity of content contributed and keywords searched on our Site.

Registration is necessary to contribute content to our Site. When you register to become a member of Genwi, we require you to specify a unique ID, your e-mail address (to confirm that you are a valid user), a password, and your date of birth (to verify your age). You must be at least 14 years of age to register with Genwi. You may, at your option, also provide your name, screen name, country of origin, city, zip code, gender, hometown, relationship status, children, sexual orientation, ethnicity, religion, blood type, height, occupation, income, company, education, a description about you, your interests, and a tagline. Supplying this information allows you to take advantage of the social networking features of our Site. 

In the "My Page" section of our Site, you can view information you submitted during the registration process under "View Profile"; update or provide additional information under "Edit Basic Info", "Edit About Me", and "Add/Edit Pics"; and make your profile private or public under "Account Settings" (your profile is public by default). As a registered user, we detect your presence on our Site by noticing when you login and logout. We also observe the keywords that you search, which content you view, which content you share with other users, as well as when, to help us determine trends and content popularity. In addition, we store the content that you contribute, such as messages, comments, and tags, and when you contributed it as part of offering those features on our Site.

**Cookies**

Our Site uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. We do not collect any information through cookies. We use a single cookie as a convenience to you to remember your login if you select "remember me" upon logging in. The cookie will be deleted when you log out; otherwise, the cookie will be retained for one year on that local machine. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of other websites you visit.

**Children's Personally Identifiable Information:**

Our Site is not directed to children under the age of 14. If a user indicates that he or she is under the age of 14, then he or she will not be permitted to register as a user. If a parent believes that his or her child has provided us with personal information, he or she can contact us via e-mail as listed below. We will promptly delete the information upon learning that it relates to a child under the age of 14.

**How the information collected is used:**

Genwi takes the privacy of our users and members very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. However, we may use demographic information collected from you during your use of our Site or during the registration process to direct advertisements from third parties to you while you use our Site.

Genwi will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this Privacy Policy without your prior consent.

**How your information is protected:**

Genwi strictly protects the security of the personal information you provide. Personal information we collect is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access, and we carefully protect this information from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

**When your information may be disclosed:**

Genwi may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
(a) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process served on Genwi or the site;   
(b) protect and defend the rights or property of Genwi; or   
(c) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety of users of Genwi, its websites, or the public.  


**Updates to this privacy policy:**

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last modified" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates.

**Sale of assets:**

In the unlikely event that Genwi or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
