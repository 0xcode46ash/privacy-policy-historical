iSixSigma takes your privacy seriously. We have created this page to clearly identify what iSixSigma will and won't do with the information that is collected on the site.

iSixSigma will not publish, disclose, sell or rent user data or any  
personal data collected from users without their explicit approval.

 **What this Privacy Policy Covers**  
This Privacy Policy covers iSixSigma's treatment of personally identifiable information that iSixSigma collects when you are on the iSixSigma site, and when you use iSixSigma's services. This policy also covers iSixSigma's treatment of any personally identifiable information that iSixSigma's business partners share with iSixSigma. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that iSixSigma does not own or control, or to people that iSixSigma does not employ or manage.

 **Information Collection and Use**  
iSixSigma collects personally identifiable information when you use certain iSixSigma products or services, when you register for an iSixSigma account, when you subscribe to an iSixSigma newsletter, when you visit iSixSigma site pages, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. iSixSigma may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners.

iSixSigma also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, iSixSigma-specific cookie information, browser information and the page you requested. iSixSigma uses information for three general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to prevent abuse of our systems.

 **Information Sharing and Disclosure**  
iSixSigma will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. iSixSigma will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when:

  * We have your consent to share the information; 
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of iSixSigma to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; or
  * We find that your actions on our web sites violate the iSixSigma Terms of Service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.



 **Cookies**  
iSixSigma may set and access iSixSigma cookies on your computer. iSixSigma allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to iSixSigma's cookies.
