# NDO Privacy Policy

Copyright Â© 2003 NDO Limited. All rights reserved.

The following statement discloses the privacy practices of NDO Limited ("NDO") for the NDO website (this "site"). By using this site, you are deemed to consent to our privacy practices. If you do not consent to these privacy practices, do not use this site or download any materials from it. 

We do revise and update our privacy practices from time to time and we reserve the right to do so without any notice to you so you should visit this page at least once every thirty days to review our current privacy practices because they are binding on you. All updates will be published at this site. Your continued use of this site will be considered your consent to any revised privacy practices. 

Your Privacy  
In general, you can visit this site without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. However, to make use of the online account management facilites or the WebMail system you are required to login. This involves the submission of identifiable information and as part of the login process we do store the IP address from whence the connection originates as part of our security measures. 

NDO provides a number of ways for you to "opt-out" of receiving certain additional information from us or having us provide your personal information to our partners. We will offer you the choice to "opt-out" at the time you give us the information. If you ever wish to check or change your "opt-out" status, either login into the Account Management facility, or feel free to contact us via email or the telephone. 

We will never pass your details onto any third party - this is any company outside of the NDO Limited group of companies. Your details will only be used by NDO Limited to contact you with information regarding service changes and any upgrades which may affect any of the products you have with NDO. Very occasionally you may recieve emails regarding new products which we believe will be of interest to you. You can opt out of recieving these emails at any time via the Account Management facility. 

Please be advised that in certain instances, it may be necessary for NDO to disclose your personal information to police or government agencies as required by our legal obligations. 

Use of Cookies  
NDO does use cookies from time to time. Cookies are small text files that a Web site can use to recognise a repeat visitor to the Web site. We use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with the online account management facilites. Your connection to this facility and security within it is governed through the use of these cookies. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser you will find certain areas of this site offer less functionality to you. 

Password  
When you access the account management facilites within this site, you will be provided a password that will allow you access. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your personal information and password. You will be responsible for all users of your password, whether or not authorised by you. You agree to immediately notify us of any unauthorised use of your password. 

Online Security  
NDO recognises the importance of privacy and security regarding the information you send us over the Internet. Online security is one of our highest priorities and we have devoted a great deal of effort to ensure that our online security measures help to safeguard your information. 

To ensure our online account management facility is secure, NDO makes use of the industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology for data encryption to the 128bit standard. 

If you are using a security-enabled browser (such as Microsoft Internet Explorer version 2.1 or greater, or Netscape Navigator version 2.0 or greater), the information you send us using the online account management facility is encrypted, making it almost impossible to read even if it is wrongly intercepted. This allows for the encryption of: 

\- potentially sensitive information such as your name and address   
\- critically-sensitive information like your credit card number 

If concerned only about the privacy of your credit card information, we encourage you to call our Customer Services team who will be happy to take this information from you over the telephone. 

If you are still uncomfortable with submitting your personal information via the Internet for any reason, please contact us over the telephone for any changes or updates. 

Encryption is based on a key that has two different parts; the public part and the private part. The public part of the key is distributed to those who want to communicate with. The private part is for the recipient's use only. 

When you send personal information using the online account management facility you use NDO's public key to encrypt your personal information. That means, if at any point during the transmission your information is intercepted, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once NDO receives your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of the key to decode it. 

NDO encrypts all information you give us when you are using our online account management facility. Remember however, if you feel uncomfortable providing any of this information online, please feel free to call the Customer Services team. 

Links to Third Party Web sites  
On this site, there may be links to companies with whom we have a relationship. NDO cannot and is not responsible for the privacy practices of our business partners. We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours.   
Please remember that any information you submit in a chat group or forum will be deemed public information and is not confidential. There is a risk in such communication venues that information can be collected and used by others. Please be careful and responsible when you are online. 

As of 1st January 2003.
