However, the amount and type of information you decide to share, and with whom you share it, is entirely up to you. 

1\. INFORMATION COLLECTED 

The primary objective of “THE WEBSITE” is to connect the people and organization so that they can share information and other things with each other to achieve their personal, professional, and social goals. To achieve this objective, “THE WEBSITE” makes features and functionality available through our website, including our mobile and other applications, developer platform, premium services, and other information provided as part of the “THE WEBSITE” services (“Services”) to enable users to develop, maintain and enhance a network of contacts, create, share, and distribute information in collaboration with one another. By joining “THE WEBSITE”, you voluntarily and willingly provide “THE WEBSITE” certain information, including personally identifiable information, which we collect in order to provide the Services. If you have any hesitation about providing information to us and/or having your information displayed on the “THE WEBSITE” website or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement, you should not become a member of the “THE WEBSITE” community; and, if you are already a member, you should close your account. 

We collect your personal information in the following ways: 

1.1. REGISTRATION OF ACCOUNT 

If you wish to become a User, you must provide us the following information to create an account: name, email address, country, username, and password. Without this minimal amount of information, you cannot create a “THE WEBSITE” account. Like other passwords, you should choose one that is not disclosed to anyone else except you. “THE WEBSITE” may request other information from you during the registration process, such as city, state, etc., that “THE WEBSITE” uses to provide better, more customized services such as status updates, better ads, and more valuable career opportunities. You acknowledge that this information is personal to you, and by creating an account on “THE WEBSITE”, you allow others, including “THE WEBSITE”, to identify you and to allow “THE WEBSITE” to use your information in accordance with our User Agreement. 

1.2. PROFILE INFORMATION 

Once you become a User, you may provide additional information to your “THE WEBSITE” Profile describing your personal, educational background, professional experiences, interests, contact information, etc. Providing additional information about yourself beyond what is required at registration is entirely at your discretion, however, providing additional information will enable you to derive more benefit from “THE WEBSITE” and your network by helping you build your identity and leverage your network and facilitating your other networking aspirations. Any information you provide at registration or in the Profile section may be used by “THE WEBSITE” as described in the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy, including for the purpose of allowing networking opportunities, or for serving more relevant advertisements on “THE WEBSITE”. If you decide not to share certain information, you may not receive the full benefit of being a “THE WEBSITE” User. 

(i) We may collect and store any personal information you enter on our website or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We also request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.   
(ii) Information about others. We may collect and store personal information about other people that you provide to us, such as their name, address and email address. If you use our website to send others (friends, relatives, colleagues, etc.) a product as a gift, we may store your personal information, and the personal information of each such recipient in order to process those requests or facilitate future activities.   
(iii) In General. We may collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address ("personal information") and other information that does not identify you. When you provide personal information through our website, the information may be sent to servers located in the United States and other countries around the world.   
(iv) We provide areas on our websites where you can post information about yourself and others and communicate with others or upload content such as photographs. Such postings are governed by our User Agreement. Also, whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information on publicly-viewable web pages, that information will be publicly available and can be collected and used by others. For example, if you post your email address, you may receive unsolicited messages. We cannot control who reads your posting or what other users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so we encourage you to exercise discretion and caution with respect to your personal information. 

1.3. CONTACTS INFORMATION 

If you wish to connect with others on “THE WEBSITE”, you may use the Services to send invitations either to their “THE WEBSITE” profiles or email addresses of people you know if they have not registered with “THE WEBSITE”. The names and email addresses of people whom you invite will be used to send your invitations and reminders as well as to allow “THE WEBSITE” to help expand your network. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another User, that User will not have access to your email address because it is displayed in the invitation. Your “THE WEBSITE” connections will also not have access to your email address. You may not invite anyone you do not know and trust to connect with you.

2.5. SHARING INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES 

”THE WEBSITE” takes the privacy of our Users very seriously, and we do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy. We will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other “THE WEBSITE” services without your explicit consent or to carry out your instructions unless, disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to: (1) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a User, individual, or government agency; (4) respond to customer service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of “THE WEBSITE”, our Users or the public. “THE WEBSITE” offers a “public profile” feature that allows Users to publish their “THE WEBSITE” profile to the public internet. This public profile will be crawled by and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name. Content distributed through “THE WEBSITE”’s sharing features and third party integrations may result in displaying some of your information outside of “THE WEBSITE”. For example, when you make a Posting or Comment, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. We may provide aggregated anonymous data about the usage of the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on “THE WEBSITE”. 

We may share non-personal information we collect and share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our website and on websites of third parties, and to analyze and report on advertising you see. We may combine non-personal information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated, non-personal information, or personal information in hashed, non-human readable form, with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis or other business purposes. 

+Service providers: We may share your personal information, which may include your name and contact information (including email address) with third parties that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, member screenings, supporting our website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our website. We may also share your name, contact information and credit card information with our authorized service providers who process credit card payments. These service providers may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes. 

Business partners: When you register or make purchases on our website or click-through our advertisements offered on third party websites, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you the applicable products, services or any advertisements. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your email address and other information to that merchant.

In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. 

2.7. DEVELOPERS USING “THE WEBSITE” PLATFORM SERVICES 

We collaborate with and allow third parties to use “THE WEBSITE”’s developer platform to offer services and functionality in combination with and outside of “THE WEBSITE”. These third parties are either our partners with whom we have negotiated an agreement to provide services. If you choose to use these Services, you may be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and/or user agreement of the “THE WEBSITE” Partner or Platform Developer, which have not necessarily been reviewed or approved by “THE WEBSITE”. It is your choice whether or not to make use of Combined Services or Platform Applications and whether to proceed under any third party terms, and once you do, the third party's terms, and not this policy, will govern how they handle information you provide to them directly or through your “THE WEBSITE” account. Also, despite our agreements and technical steps taken to restrict access to and avoid possible misuse of information, we may not screen or audit all Combined Services or Platform Applications. We also cannot guarantee that any “THE WEBSITE” Partner or Platform Developer will abide by our agreement. You agree that your use of Combined Services or Platform Applications is on an “as is” basis and without any warranty. If you use any Combined Service or Platform Application, the “THE WEBSITE” Partner or Platform Developer may access and share certain information about you, such as non-public profile information and information visible only to your connections. This includes information about your connections by virtue of you being connected to others. However, unless you have used a Combined Service or Platform Application, it can only access the information about you that is otherwise visible to other “THE WEBSITE” Users. 

2.8. POLLS AND SURVEYS 

Polls and Surveys may be conducted by “THE WEBSITE”, “THE WEBSITE” Users, or third parties. As a User, you may be invited to participate in polls and surveys from the “THE WEBSITE” website. Your selection may be random, or it may be based on your non-personally identifiable information, such as geography, or other demographics. Whether or not you decide to participate in a poll or survey is completely up to you. After you complete a poll, you will be given access to the aggregate responses of the poll on a results page. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. Further, “THE WEBSITE” or third parties may follow up with you via email regarding your participation. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will only be used for the purpose of delivering incentives and/or verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. We will not disclose any personally identifiable information to any third parties in connection with the conduct of any polls or surveys. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it.

3\. YOUR INFORMATION CHOICES 

3.1. LIMITATION OF FEATURES 

You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our website. 

3.2. PROMOTIONAL EMAILS N INTERNAL MESSAGES 

When you register on our website, you will consent automatically to receive email messages or internal messages from us, or other Users, or other third parties, about special offers. You may or may not be able to modify this consent later as long as you are a member of our site. You may be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to opt out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship email communications, such as service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account, or otherwise opting out of receipt of promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a service provider) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change you preferences directly with that third party. 

3.3. ACCESSING AND CHANGING YOUR ACCOUNT INFORMATION 

You can review the personal information you provided to us and make any desired changes to the information you publish, or to the settings for your “THE WEBSITE” account including your email and contact preferences, at any time by logging in to your account on the “THE WEBSITE” website. Please be aware that even after your request for a change is processed, “THE WEBSITE” may, for a time, retain residual information about you in its backup and/or archival copies of its database. 

3.4. DEFAULT SETTINGS 

Since the mission of “THE WEBSITE” is to connect the people and organizations from all over the world, we have established what we believe to be reasonable default settings that we have found most users prefer. We encourage our Users to review their account settings and adjust them in accordance with their preferences. 

3.5. CLOSING YOUR ACCOUNT 

If you have an online account with us, you also may close your account at any time by visiting the "Account Settings" page for your account. You can also close your account through the “THE WEBSITE” customer service. If you close your “THE WEBSITE” account, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our publicly viewable database. If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your information, and may delete any or all of your account information without liability. If you close your account, we may retain certain data contributed by you if “THE WEBSITE” believes it may be necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analytical purposes and recordkeeping integrity, as well as to prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, enforce our terms and conditions, take actions we deem necessary to protect the integrity of our website or our users, or take other actions otherwise permitted by law. For instance, just as an email you may send to another person through an email service provider resides in that person’s inbox even after you delete it from your sent files or close your account, emails you send on “THE WEBSITE” to other Users, as well as your contributions to “THE WEBSITE” Postings or Comments, may remain visible to others after you have closed your account. Similarly, other information you have shared with others, or that other Users have copied, may also remain visible. “THE WEBSITE” disclaims any liability in relation to the deletion or retention (subject to the terms herein) of information or any obligation not to delete the information. “THE WEBSITE” does not control when search engines update their cache, which may contain certain public profile information that has since been removed from “THE WEBSITE”’s publicly viewable database. In addition, if certain information has already been provided to third parties as described in this Privacy Policy, retention of that information will be subject to those third parties' policies. After you close your account, you will not be able to sign in to our website or access any of your personal information. However, you can open a new, separate account at any time. There will be no ways to re-activate your previous account. 

3.6. MEMORIALIZING ACCOUNTS 

If we come to know that a User is deceased, we may memorialize the User’s account. In these cases we may restrict profile access, remove messaging functionality, and close an account if we receive a formal request from the User’s next of kin or other proper legal request to do so. 

4\. YOUR OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES 

4.1. YOUR OBLIGATIONS 

As a User, you have certain obligations and responsibilities towards other Users. Some of these obligations are imposed by applicable law and regulations, and others have become standard practice in user-friendly communities of like-minded members such as “THE WEBSITE”.

6\. SECURITY 

We take appropriate security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure. We want you to feel confident using our website to transact business. In an effort to help secure your personal information, access to your data on “THE WEBSITE” is password-protected, and sensitive financial data (such as credit card information or other payment details) is protected by SSL encryption when it is transmitted between your web browser and the “THE WEBSITE”’s payment gateway. To secure any data you store on our servers, “THE WEBSITE” also periodically inspects its system for possible vulnerabilities and attacks, and we use one of the most advanced and secured data center. Nevertheless, since the internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to “THE WEBSITE”. Hence, although we take steps to secure your information, there is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by violation of any of our physical, technical, or managerial precautions. It is your responsibility to safeguard the security of your login information. Kindly note that emails, messaging, and other similar modes of communication with other Users of “THE WEBSITE” are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to convey any confidential or sensitive information through these means. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure email.

We may also disclose your personal information or any other information you provide to another third party as part of a sale of the assets of “THE WEBSITE”, a subsidiary or division, or as the result of a change in control and management of the company. Any third party to which “THE WEBSITE” transfers or sells “THE WEBSITE”’s assets will have the right to continue to use the personal and other information that you provide to us. 

8\. VISITING OUR WEBSITES FROM DIFFERNET COUNTRIES: 

Since our website is global, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in a data center in different countries where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.
