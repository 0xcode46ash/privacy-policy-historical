# Website Privacy and Cookie Policy - ISPreview UK

The following page details how ISPreview.co.uk handles privacy and the use of cookie files, including the disclosure of our information gathering and dissemination practices. Please also check our the [Terms of Use](http://www.ispreview.co.uk/terms.shtml) for further details. 

### **Information Automatically Logged**

We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information for use in our statistics system, this allows us to tally the number of visitors per minute/hour/day/week/month/year etc. 

### **Cookies**

Our Site uses first party / session cookies (a small text file that is stored on a user's computer by a web browser for tracking and record-keeping purposes) to deliver content specific to your interests via our survey (poll) system (cookieset), which allows us to block multiple voting abuse from specific individuals. We also use them to identify your login status (online/offline) for our public discussion forum (bb_*) and reader reviews (PHPSESSID) service. Outside of this we do not use cookies to store any personal information. 

### **Third Party Cookies**

Like most websites ISPreview.co.uk also uses a number of external authentication and statistical gathering systems, which allows visitors from other websites and services to communicate with a known identity (username) across several different sites. These optional systems rely upon harmless and temporary third party cookies, which are set remotely (not by ISPreview.co.uk), to maintain a login session between websites and do not generally hold any personally identifiable information. Visitors can choose whether or not to enable them by registering for the related service (they aren't active unless you register to use the related service first).

We also use the Google Analytics service to gather basic statistical data about how our website is being viewed and accessed by its readers, which helps us to identify which content is popular and improve upon it. Similarly our continued operation is largely funded through direct advertising revenue (banners and links) and some commission from specific product sales.

Please note ISPreview.co.uk does do not have any access to or control over third party cookies. Readers whom wish to opt-out of the above systems / advertisements can do so either by adjusting the settings of your website browser to block related cookies/content or by visiting the appropriate organisations site and opting-out directly. Take note that blocking the wrong cookie could prevent many of this websites services, such as the polls, forum and reviews system, from working properly. 

### **Advertisers**

We use both an external Google solution and our own system to display ads on the site. These ads may contain cookies designed to track pageview, click count and IP information purely for statistical monitoring purposes. 

### **Surveys**

Our online surveys may sometimes ask visitors for contact information (like email address). They also use IP and Cookie status information to detect whether a reader has voted more than once (prevent abuse). 

### **External Links**

This site contains links to other sites. ISPreview are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

### **Special Relationships**

Presently ISPreview has three external relationships with other sites, including Google.com for advertising (see 'Advertisers' above), Thinkbroadband.com for one of our broadband 'Speedtest' services and Samknows.com for our 'Broadband Coverage Checker'. The Speedtest includes a requirement for users to enter their postcode and phone number - these details are NOT shared with or sold on to third parties outside of ISPreview/Thinkbroadband and instead collected to help build a geographic map of broadband performance/speed around the UK. Similarly the Broadband Coverage Checker requests either a postcode or phone number, however neither are retained by the remote server past your initial service. 

### **Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

### **Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information such as IP, E-Mails (if submitted) are kept in ‘none readable’ locations and protected by ‘admin only access’. The only person with the ability to access this information is the owner of the server and nobody else, your data is kept totally confidential. Please see 'Special Relationships' above for information regarding our partnership with Thinkbroadband.
