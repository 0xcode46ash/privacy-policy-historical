# ISPreview UK - Independent Internet Service Provider Information Source

_ISPreview_ has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: [ISPreview](http://www.ispreview.co.uk/).

**Information Automatically Logged**

We use your IP address to gather broad demographic information for use in our statistics system, this allows us to tally the number of visitors per minute/hour/day/week/month/year etc.

**Cookies**

Our Site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests via our survey system, it allows us to block multiple votes from specific individual readers. We also use them to identify status (online/offline) for the discussion forum.

**Advertisers**

We use both an external Google solution and our own system to display ads on the site. These ads may contain cookies designed to track pageview, click count and IP information purely for statistical monitoring purposes.

**Surveys**

Our online surveys may sometimes ask visitors for contact information (like email address). They also use IP and Cookie status information to detect whether a reader has voted more than once (prevent abuse).

**External Links**

This site contains links to other sites. _ISPreview_ are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Special Relationships**

Presently ISPreview has three external relationships with other sites, including Google.com for advertising (see ' _Advertisers_ ' above), Thinkbroadband.com for one of our broadband ' _Speedtest_ ' services and Samknows.com for our ' _Broadband Coverage Checker_ '. The Speedtest includes a requirement for users to enter their postcode and phone number - these details are NOT shared with or sold on to third parties outside of ISPreview/Thinkbroadband and instead collected to help build a geographic map of broadband performance/speed around the UK. Similarly the Broadband Coverage Checker requests either a postcode or phone number, however neither are retained by the remote server past your initial service.

**Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Security**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. All information such as IP, E-Mails (if submitted) are kept in ‘none readable’ locations and protected by ‘admin only access’. The only person with the ability to access this information is the owner of the server and nobody else, your data is kept totally confidential. Please see ' _Special Relationships_ ' above for information regarding our partnership with Thinkbroadband.
