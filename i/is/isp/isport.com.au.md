Privacy Policy

This statement sets out iSport's policies relating to your personal information. It applies to your conduct on the iSport network of websites (the "Network"). These policies are in addition to iSport's general Terms of Use governing the Network and should be read in conjunction with such Terms of Use. 

Please note that separate policies apply to the use of sites that are available through the Network but are not operated by iSport directly. 

**1\. Your personal information is important to us**

iSport recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policies will govern how iSport handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy. 

**2\. iSport is committed to the best-practice privacy standards**

iSport is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our privacy policy represents industry best practice. iSport is a member of the Internet Industry Association, which is developing a Code which provides a high standard of privacy protection. iSport is already committed to complying with this Code, and is committed to complying with the voluntary National Principles for the Fair Handling of Personal Information developed by the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner in 1998 [see the Australian Privacy Commissioner's website]. iSport will comply with any laws introduced to strengthen protections for consumers' privacy. 

**3\. Collecting information about you**

iSport will not collect or monitor any personal information about you without your consent unless we believe it is necessary:   
· Because it is required by law.   
· To provide you with a service which you have requested.   
· To implement our terms of service.   
· To protect the rights or property of iSport, any iSport user, or any member of the public.   
· To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.

You may provide iSport with information directly, such as through subscribing to email lists or identifying yourself when using particular services. The amount of information we collect about you depends on how you use the sites on our Network. The only personal information we collect is what you tell us about yourself, for example by subscribing to the iSport Clubhouse or newsletter. 

iSport uses cookies to help maximise your enjoyment of our Network. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. Please see further information on how we use cookies below. 

iSport intends to introduce a membership system that will give you the option of enjoying enhanced services on our Network. Again, any changes in how we use your personal information will only occur with your consent. 

Any further collection of your personal information than that explained above will only occur with consent from you. iSport only collects information from your use of our Network and not from other organisations. 

**4\. Our use of cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the Network. 

The use of cookies can enhance your enjoyment of what is offered by iSport, because they can help personalise your experience of our website. They can make it easier for you to shop online and can ensure that information provided to you is most relevant to your interests. Cookies can also provide us with aggregate information on how people use our websites, and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Network. 

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies simply operate as a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our website, almost like a continuing questionnaire. We do not link this information back to other information that you have provided to us. ISport does not store any information inside cookies. 

**5\. Using and disclosing your personal information**

iSport will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, or access your communications on our websites, unless: 

· Required by law.   
· We believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested.   
· To implement our terms of service.   
· To protect the rights or property of iSport, any iSport user, or any member of the public.   
· To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.

iSport and its affiliates recognise the trust you place in us when you give us personal information. In order to operate the website or deliver a service we may sometimes share your personal information with an affiliate or with a service partner. We will not otherwise disclose your personal information to other companies without your explicit consent. 

**6\. "Spam" (promotional email)**

We will not send you "spam" (advertising information) without first asking you whether you wish to have promotional information sent to you. If you are receiving promotional information about iSport or its affiliates and do not wish to receive this information any longer, you may remove your name from our list either by visiting the website from which the communication was sent and following the instructions on how to withdraw your information from that site (where that facility is available), or emailing us at privacy@iSport.com.au and asking to be removed from our mailing list. Please allow seven days for this request to be processed. 

**7\. Storage and security of your personal information**

iSport will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is stored on secure servers that are protected in controlled facilities. In addition, our employees and data processors are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by iSport. However, iSport will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information. 

You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the iSport website. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security. 

**8\. You can access the information we keep about you**

Your trust in iSport is very important to us. If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information any part of our Network is holding about you, you are welcome to request your folder by emailing us at privacy@iSport.com.au. Our file of your information will be made available to you within seven days. 

**9\. Changing and deleting the information we have about you**

If at any time you wish to change personal information that is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us by e-mailing us at privacy@iSport.com.au. and we will change this record. If you wish to have your personal information deleted, please let us know in the same manner as referred to above and we will take all reasonable steps to delete it unless we need to keep it for legal reasons. 

**10\. ISport and links to other websites**

iSport provides links to websites outside of the iSport service. These linked sites are not under the control of iSport, and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using their websites. 

**11\. What to do if you have a problem or question**

If iSport becomes aware of any ongoing concerns or problems with sites on our Network, we will take these issues seriously and work to address these concerns. If you have any further queries relating to our privacy policy, or you have a problem or complaint, please contact us at privacy@iSport.com.au. 

**12\. Future changes**

Our commitment to make iSport Australia's leading Community Sports Web network means that we are constantly adding new sites and features to the Network. Because of this, from time to time, our policies will be reviewed and may be revised. iSport reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time and notify you by posting an updated version of the policy on its website. 

**13\. Specific conditions: iSport sites**

These principles apply generally to the iSport Network. However, some iSport sites will be operated jointly with other reputable organisations. These sites may have special terms and conditions that differ from these and may affect the handling of your personal information. Please check these when using these sites. In a situation where these privacy principles and the specific terms and conditions of a iSport website differ, the specific terms will prevail.
