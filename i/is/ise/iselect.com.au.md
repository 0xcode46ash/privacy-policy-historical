**Security and Access**

The iSelect service is professionally hosted and operates in a secure environment. The utmost care is taken to ensure the security of your information once received. While we take all reasonable care to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee that information sent and received over the Internet is 100% secure. Sending and receiving information over the iSelect Internet site is therefore at the users own risk. 

Only authorised persons employed by iSelect will have access to your personal information. This is kept in a secure environment and all employees are required to adhere to strict confidentiality policies. 

**Personal Information**

iSelect will not disclose or sell any personally identifiable information received through our web site, e-mail, call centre, fax and mail. We will only disclose specific information if required by law. 

iSelect has requested that its participating [health insurers](https://web.archive.org/web/20050616172041id_/http%3A//www.iselect.com.au/health_insurance_funds_participating.htm) ensure client data is kept in strict confidence by maintaining appropriate privacy procedures. iSelect is not responsible, nor can we guarantee use of information required by the health insurance funds for the purposes of membership application or potential membership validation where members have not joined directly through iSelect. iSelect will not disclose individual client data regarding health insurance preferences to health insurers unless required as part of the normal membership application or validation process. 

We may use the information we collect from you in aggregate to help us analyse the quality of our service and help design better health insurance products for our clients.
