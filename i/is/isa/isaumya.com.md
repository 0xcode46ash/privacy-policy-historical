# Privacy Policy - Saumya Majumder

At  **iSaumya.com** , I am dedicated to safeguarding and preserving your privacy when visiting my site or communicating electronically with me. This Privacy Policy, together with myterms of use, explains what happens to any personal data that you provide to me, or that I collect from you when you are on this site. I do update this Policy from time to time so please do return and review this Policy regularly.

###  **Information I  Collect**

In operating my website I may collect and process the following data about you:

 **i.**  Details of your visits to my website and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data.

 **ii.**  Information that you provide by filling in forms on my website, such as when you registered for information or make a purchase.

 **iii.**  Information provided to me when you communicate with me for any reason.

###  **Use of Your Information**

The information that I collect and store relating to you is primarily used to enable me to provide my services to you. In addition, I may use the information for the following purposes:

 **i.**  To provide you with information requested from me, relating to my products or services. To provide information on other products which I feel may be of interest to you, where you have consented to receive such information.

 **ii.**  To meet my contractual commitments to you.

 **iii.**  To notify you about any changes to my website, such as improvements or service/product changes, that may affect my service.

If you are an existing customer, I may contact you with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of a previous sale to you.  
Further, I may use your data, or permit selected third parties to use your data, so that you can be provided with information about unrelated goods and services which I consider may be of interest to you. I or they may contact you about these goods and services by any of the methods that you consented to at the time your information was collected.

If you are a new customer, I will only contact you or allow third parties to contact you only when you have provided consent and only by those means you provided consent for.  
If you do not want me to use your data for my or third parties you will have the opportunity to withhold your consent to this when you provide your details to me on the form on which I collect your data.

I will take all reasonable steps to make sure that your data is treated securely and in agreement with this Privacy Policy.

Data that is provided to me is stored on my secure servers. Details relating to any transactions entered into on my site will be encrypted to ensure its safety.  
The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore I cannot guarantee the security of data sent to me electronically and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk. Where I have given you (or where you have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of my site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.

Other than as mentioned above, I will not send you or any of your representatives, unsolicited emails, commercials, offers or advertisements. We will not sell, rent, or loan customer information to any outside firm nor will I use the personal information for my or its partners own marketing purposes, other than as requested.

I use industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and it is implemented throughout my application systems and networks.

Information exchanges and transactions, including authentication, reporting, passwords and billing related data between customers and Mobile Marketing Allies application systems are strictly protected using SSL technology.

This ensures that the customer’s session is completely private and secure from both external systems and other customers using Mobile Marketing Allies.

### Credit Card Information

I use PayPal to process all payments. When credit/charge card payment is chosen, information is then transferred to Mobile Marketing Allies’ payment processing partners using industry-leading, secure transmission technology, including SSL – the transmission standard used for transactions by major financial institutions.
