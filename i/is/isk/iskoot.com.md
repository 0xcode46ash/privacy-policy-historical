The EEA and Switzerland also have recognized the Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, iSkoot adheres to the principles set forth in the Safe Harbor.

#### Data retention

We retain your personal information as necessary to provide our Services as well as support our internal needs. However, by doing so we do not either expressly or impliedly endorse, affirm or in any manner assume any responsibility for such information. If you would like us to delete your personal information from your account, see the section “Deletion of information” below.

#### Deletion of information

If you wish to delete your personally identifiable information that is stored in our databases, please use the ‘Contact us’ page on the Website.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, there may be circumstances where we are legally required to retain the information we collect about you (for example, in connection with court proceedings) and despite your request for us to delete your personal information, we will retain what we are legally required to keep. Moreover, we reserve the right to make anonymous the personal information so that it is no longer associated with you rather than deleting it.

If you close your account, we have no obligation to retain your personal information, and may delete any or all of your personal information without liability.

#### Information security

We implement information security systems and procedures to secure the information stored on our servers.
