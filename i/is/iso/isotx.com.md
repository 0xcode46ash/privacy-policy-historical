        Isotx has created this privacy policy (the " **Policy** ") to explain our privacy practices so you will understand when and how personal information is collected, used, disclosed and protected with respect to our software(“ **Software** "), and Web site (" **Site** ") located at [http://www.Isotx.com](http://www.isotx.com/).  By using the Site and the Software, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Policy.

We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. If we make any material changes to our Policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and update the "last revised" date set forth above and notify each registered user at the email address we have on file for them.  The updated Policy will govern each use of the Site from the date of update forward.  Therefore, we encourage you to check our Policy whenever you use the Site.

### INFORMATION ABOUT YOU

We collect three basic types of information with our Site and Software, namely personal information, individual usage patterns and aggregate information.  Personal information is information that is directly associated with a specific person or entity such as a user's e-mail address, usage information and user-chosen ID and password.  Individual Usage Patterns includes information automatically collected by the Software about your game play (including frequency and type of games played), and usage patterns of the Site, the Software and the third party software downloaded through the Software.  We may share Individual Usage Patterns with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes.

Our definition of personal information does not include “aggregate information.”  Aggregate information is data we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, information on how you use our Site and Software may be collected and combined with information about how others use the Site and Software, but no personal information will be included in the resulting data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users' needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services.  We may share aggregate information about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand and improve our services, and for advertising and marketing purposes.

Those are the types of personal and other information we collect. You should refer to the rest of this Policy to see how we use, disclose and protect this information:

### Information You Give Us.

We collect information you give us at various times when you register with us and use our Site and the Software.  For example, when you register an account on the Site, we may collect various kinds of contact information about you including, for example, your e-mail address.  You will also be asked to create a user-chosen ID and password for your use when accessing certain portions of the Site. We may also collect personal information if you provide it via e-mail, message boards, or other interactive services. Please do not post any information on the message boards or other interactive services that you expect to keep private.  Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions.
