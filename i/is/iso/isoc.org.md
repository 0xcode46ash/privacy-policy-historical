**THE INTERNET SOCIETY'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY**

In keeping with the goals and objectives of the organization, the Internet Society is committed to the highest degree of respect for the privacy of our members and of visitors to our site. 

**WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**

As is standard practice for most web sites, certain visitor characteristics are reflected in our web server logs (e.g. operating system, browser version, and Internet Protocol (IP) address). We make no attempt to link them with the individual visitors to the site. 

In the case of online balloting for Internet Society elections, Members are asked to supply numbers corresponding to those on their printed ballots to ensure that only a single vote is registered. The details of the actual votes are maintained only during the election process solely to allow proper verification and audit of the election. 

On its web site, the Internet Society gives visitors the option of providing certain personally identifiable information for purposes such as joining the organization, renewing membership, participating in discussion groups, submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for conferences. This information includes name, postal address, email address, and other pertinent data.

**WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION**

With regard to non-personally identifiable information, we may periodically analyze our web site logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order to better serve the needs of visitors to the site. Under some circumstances this information may be used for purposes of systems administration or server troubleshooting and security.

We do not sell, rent or share any personally identifiable information voluntarily supplied by visitors or our membership mailing list. We may occasionally subcontract a provide such information to third party subcontractors to make specific offerings on our behalf and with our consent, but only on contractual terms that protect and after measures have been taken to monitor against misuse and unauthorized disclosure of that information. Members may choose to participate in these offerings. More information on the procedure to do so is supplied below.

Membership information is collected and maintained solely in order to provide our members with access to specific benefits accorded to them through membership in the Society.

Any further email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information submitted by visitors voluntarily in the course of inquiries and comments are used only for purposes of taking action in relation to the nature of the inquiry or comment.

These mailings must be requested by checking the applicable box at the time of membership or renewal, or through the manner described in the above paragraph. If this option is not selected, you will not receive these offerings.
