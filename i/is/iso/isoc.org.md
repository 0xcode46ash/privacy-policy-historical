# Internet Society Privacy Policy | Internet Society

**Effective date: 15 December 2011**

###  The Internet Society's Commitment to Privacy

In keeping with the goals and objectives of the organisation, the Internet Society is committed to the highest degree of respect for the privacy of our members and of visitors to our site.

###  What Information do we collect?

As is standard practice for most web sites, certain visitor characteristics are reflected in our web server logs (such as, operating system, browser version, and Internet Protocol (IP) address). We make no attempt to link them with the individual visitors to the site.

In the case of online balloting for Internet Society elections, Members are asked to supply numbers corresponding to those on their printed ballots to ensure that only a single vote is registered. The details of the actual votes are maintained only during the election process solely to allow proper verification and audit of the election.

On its web site, the Internet Society gives visitors the option of providing certain personally identifiable information for purposes such as joining the organisation, renewing membership, participating in discussion groups, submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for conferences. This information includes name, postal address, email address, and other pertinent data.

By voluntarily providing us with your Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Due to the nature of the Internet if you are visiting this site from a country other than the United States, your communications will inevitably result in the transfer of information across international boundaries. By visiting this web site you consent to these transfers. If you provide personal data to this site, you acknowledge and agree that such personal data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of the Internet Society and its affiliates, agents, and service providers located in the United States and in other countries.

###  What we do with the Information

With regard to non-personally identifiable information, we may periodically analyse our web site logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order to better serve the needs of visitors to the site. Under some circumstances this information may be used for purposes of systems administration or server troubleshooting and security.

We do not sell, rent, or share any personally identifiable information voluntarily supplied by visitors or our membership mailing list. We may occasionally provide such information to third party subcontractors to make specific offerings on our behalf and with our consent, but only on contractual terms that protect, and after measures have been taken to monitor against misuse and unauthorised disclosure of that information. Members may choose to participate in these offerings. More information on the procedure to do so is supplied below.

Membership information is collected and maintained solely in order to provide our members with access to specific benefits accorded to them through membership in the Society.

Any further email addresses, phone numbers, or other contact information submitted by visitors voluntarily in the course of inquiries and comments are used only for purposes of taking action in relation to the nature of the inquiry or comment.
