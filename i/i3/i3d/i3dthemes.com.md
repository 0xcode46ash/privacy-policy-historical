**Identifying Information.** In general, you can visit the site without telling us who you are or providing any information about yourself. In some areas of the site, we ask you to provide information that will enable us to process an order, offer services that require registration, assist you with technical support issues or to follow up with you. Generally, i3d requests identifying information when you: 

  1. Register at our website. 
  2. Place an order.
  3. Provide feedback to an online survey or tell us about an idea or suggestion. 
  4. Participate in a rebate program, contest, or other promotional offer. 
  5. Request a custom design (logo, banner, intro page, or graphics)
  6. Request information or files from technical support or customer service. 



In these instances, Lucky Marble will ask for your name, address, e-mail address, phone number and other appropriate information needed to provide you with these services. In all instances, if you receive a newsletter or other mailing from us, you will always be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.

**What Lucky Marble Will Do With Your Information.** If you choose to give us personal information for any of the purposes above, this information is retained by LuckyMarble and will only be used by i3d to support your customer relationship with us. We will not add you to a mailing list, or newsletter without your registration from this service. We will only contact you if further information is required from you to complete a service.

**What Others May Do With Your Information.** LuckyMarble **does not** share, rent, or sell **any** personally identifying information provided through our site to any outside organization for use in its marketing or solicitations. We may also share aggregate information about its customers and its web site visitors to advertisers, business partners, and other third parties. For example, we might share that our users are x percent PCs users and y percent Macintosh users. None of this information, however, will contain personal, identifying information about our users. 

**LuckyMarble On-line Store.** The LuckyMarble On-line Store is designed to give you options concerning the privacy of your identifying information. If you choose, you can set up an account. This will allow you to have a customized order page for express ordering and to view your purchasing history. To protect your privacy, we have designed the sites to include certain steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections in an account. You will always have access to this account information and can view it, update it or correct it at any time. To access your information, you will need to use a password. 

When purchasing products through the our web site, the order form will also ask you to provide a daytime telephone number. However, the telephone number is only used to quickly resolve questions relative to an order, such as to clarify customer email addresses that are inactive, or entered incorrectly.

Credit card information stored within our system is encrypted. Should any information need to be displayed, the account number is masked and will only show the last four numbers.

**Third Party Links.** i3dthemes.com does provide links to other sites. Other Internet sites and services have separate privacy and data collection practices. Once you leave i3dthemes.com, i3d cannot control, and has no responsibility for, the privacy policies or data collection activities at another site. 

**Cookies.** At times, we will use a feature on your web browser to send your computer a "cookie". We do not use cookies to retrieve any personal information from your computer. We only use cookies to learn ways to enhance our Sites, and to give you better, more personalized service while in our web site. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is sent. However, some functions of the Sites will not function if you refuse cookies. These area's of our web site will have information posted about cookies, and when a cookie will be uploaded to your computer.

**Children's Privacy Protection.** 'Lucky Marble' is sensitive to the heightened need to protect the privacy of children under the age of 13. The vast majority of the material on our web site is not intended for children and is not targeted to children under the age of 13. i3d does not knowingly collect data from children and, if we learn that we have received personal data from a child, we will remove this information from our database. 

**Changes to this Policy.** i3d may from time to time revise its privacy policy. You should therefore periodically visit this page, so you are aware of any such revisions. We will not, however, use your existing information in a manner not previously disclosed. You will be advised and have the opportunity to opt out of any new use of your information.

We know customers are concerned about credit card security. You have three choices when purchasing from us. You may either: 

  * Use your PayPal account (or sign up today!), in which case your personal credit card information is not given to i3d.
  * Purchase via i3dthemes.com, in which case your personal credit card information is used, but not stored, unless you sign up for a recurring (subscribed) order such as web hosting or web plugin. 
  * Or contact our sales department to arrange another method of payment.
