This privacy policy describes the privacy practices of Ixia and its worldwide affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “Ixia,” “our,” or “we”), with respect to Personal Data or other information that has been obtained by Ixia through our websites or any other way (the “Privacy Policy”). Ixia is committed to protecting your privacy and we want to ensure that you understand what we collect from or about you, how we use it and the safeguards we have in place designed to protect it.

This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.

**_Data Collection_**

“Personal Data" may include your name, addresses, telephone number, email addresses, user name, password, and other specific information such as your organization’s employees or contacts at your customers, partners and/or suppliers.  In addition to information we receive from you, we receive information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, social media platforms and other third parties.

Each Ixia website has a specific purpose and has its own characteristics. If additional Personal Data collections are necessary for a specific Ixia website, you will be so informed on the website.

The following paragraphs describe how Ixia may use your Personal Data.

_Fulfilling your Request_

If you request something from Ixia, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, for instance, Ixia's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, or customs authorities involved in fulfilling your request.

_Website use_

We may use information we collect about you to improve the content of our websites and provide you with a personalized experience on our websites, such as providing you with content in which you may be interested and making navigation on our sites easier.

Ixia websites can include hyperlinks to third party websites. Ixia does not control these websites and thus may not be held responsible for their practices relating to the confidentiality and security of your Personal Data. We invite you to review those websites' privacy policies before using them or providing them with your Personal Data.

We may use your Personal Data to provide support for products or services you have obtained from us, such as notifying you of a product update or fix.

If such information includes your email address, postal address or telephone number, you may receive periodic emails, postal mailings or telephone contact from us with information on new Ixia products and services, Ixia upcoming events or other Ixia marketing information.

_Information of Business Partners_

If you represent an Ixia business partner (including a customer, supplier, etc.), we may use information provided to Ixia to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent, and Ixia business partners generally. We may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes, as well as use the information in connection with entering into or performing transactions with you, unless you have told us not to.
