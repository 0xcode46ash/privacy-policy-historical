A cookie is a small text file that a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit a site. It enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login, language, font size and other display preferences) over a period of time, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or browse from one page to another.

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

We use two types of cookies:  persistent cookies and session cookies.  A persistent cookie helps us recognize you as an existing user, so it’s easier to return to our sites.  A persistent cookie stays in your browser and will be read by us when you return to one of our sites.  Persistent cookies will expire after one year.  Session cookies only last for as long as the session (usually the current visit to a website or a browser session).

**_What is Do Not Track (DNT)?_**

DNT is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism for allowing Internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites by using browser settings. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been working with industry groups, Internet browsers, technology companies, and regulators to develop a DNT technology standard. While some progress has been made, it has been slow. No standard has been adopted to date. As such, Ixia does not use "do not track" signals.

**_Privacy Policy Amendments_**

Any amendments the Privacy and/or Cookie Policy will be posted at this URL and will be effective when posted.  This Policy was last updated on June 27, 2017.
