# Privacy policy - ICRC

The new-look ICRC website has many new features to help you find information about our organization. Find out how to get the most from the ICRC site.

## Privacy policy for the websites of the International Committee of the Red Cross

The ICRC is committed to protecting your online privacy. This policy governs all pages hosted by the ICRC, including the FamilyLinks website* (see below). It does not apply to pages hosted by other organizations, including National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies and their International Federation, which have their own privacy policies.

The ICRC uses the information it collects about you to better understand how its website is used, to send information on the ICRC you have requested or that may be considered of interest to you, and to manage online donations.

To understand how your personal information will be treated, please read the following policy. This policy may change from time to time so please refer to it periodically.

## This policy will let you know:

  * What identifiable information is collected from you
  * How the ICRC uses the information
  * Who is collecting the information
  * With whom the information may be shared
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information



## What identifiable information is collected from you?

The type and amount of information received and stored by the ICRC depends on how you use the website. You can access most ICRC pages without stating who you are and without revealing any personal information.

The ICRC does not collect information identifying you personally (such as your name, address, phone number or e-mail address) unless that information is voluntarily disclosed. There are instances where the ICRC requests information that does identify you personally for the purpose of providing you with specific services or of corresponding with you. Information that you supply in this way will not be shared with any third party except where needed to provide a requested service.

## How does the ICRC use the information?

The ICRC does not distribute, sell or rent user information to anyone. The ICRC uses the information collected about you to improve its understanding of web visitors and to send information that you have requested or that may be considered of interest to you. Some information identifying ICRC donors is forwarded to third parties for purely technical and administrative processing. These parties are not authorized to distribute, sell or rent user information.

## Who is collecting the information?

Any personal information that you disclose on the ICRC website is shared only with the ICRC, unless stated otherwise. For example, once you fill in and submit the form for making an online donation, you are redirected to the highly secure “Saferpay” environment of a partner company (Telekurs Card Solutions AG), where you are invited to enter your credit card details.

## With whom may the ICRC share the information?

As a general rule, the ICRC will not disclose any information identifying you personally, except with your permission or where required by law.

## What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information?

Any information on new ICRC products that you register to receive will be sent to you electronically or by other means. The ICRC may also send you unsolicited e-mail messages it feels may be of interest to you. On some ICRC forms, such as that for online donations, you are invited to indicate whether you are interested in receiving information via e-mail about the ICRC. You will not be placed on any mailing list if you do not select this option.
