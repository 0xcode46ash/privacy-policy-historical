# About The Center for Public Integrity | Our Organization - Privacy Policy and Terms of Use

**Terms of Use**

This site is published by the Center for Public Integrity, a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization located at 910 17th Street NW, Washington, DC 20006. Contents of this site, including all site and section names, logos, other graphics, organized listings, presentation strategies, interface design, and other design elements, are covered by trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual and trade property rights, held jointly or separately by the Center for Public Integrity. All rights are reserved. Contributing writers also may hold rights to some material. Material on this site may not be copied, mirrored, cataloged, displayed simultaneously with another site in part or in whole, nor may any of its sub-programs be accessed from any page without the express written consent of the appropriate rights holder. Use of this site contractually obliges each user to these terms. News media may use portions of the content of this site and refer to its contents with appropriate credit given to the Center for Public Integrity. [Republication rights](http://www.publicintegrity.org/about/our_organization/press_kit/) inquiries may be made to the media relations manager, Steve Carpinelli.

**Privacy Policy**

The Center for Public Integrity is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The Center for Public Integrity collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about him or her. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user need not log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he or she may still use our site. The only drawback is that access for such a user will be limited in some areas of our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user visits to our site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the Center for Public Integrity is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage those leaving our site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this website. Links to other websites are provided as a convenience. By clicking on them, you will be leaving the Center for Public Integrity’s website. The Center does not approve or control these sites and does not guarantee the accuracy of their information.

**Newsletter**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for such contact information as e-mail address.

**Tell-A-Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask for that friend’s e-mail address. The Center for Public Integrity will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. The Center for Public Integrity stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail.

**Security**

The Center for Public Integrity takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration form asks a user to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or Social Security number), that information is protected with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and or on the address bar of browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when just “surfing.” While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users’ information—not just the sensitive information mentioned above—is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you may use our online form to [contact the webmaster](http://www.publicintegrity.org/about/our_organization/contact/).

**Special Offers**

Established members will occasionally receive information about products, services, special deals, or our newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive such communications. Please see our “Choice/Opt-out” section below. 

**Choice/Opt-out**

Our users are given the opportunity to “opt-out” of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point we ask for the information. For example, our donation form has an “opt-out” mechanism so users who contribute to us, but don’t want to receive marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by accessing their subscription management page or by selecting the “unsubscribe” or “remove” options printed at the bottom of each newsletter.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. When we do, we will also revise the “last updated” date at the bottom of the privacy statement. 

**Questions**

Questions about this policy may be directed to the Center’s media relations manager [Steve Carpinelli](mailto:scarpinelli@publicintegrity.org) at (202) 481-1225.
