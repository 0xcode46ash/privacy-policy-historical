Terms of Use

All rights are reserved. Contributing writers also may hold rights to some material. 

Material on this site may not be copied, mirrored, cataloged, displayed simultaneously with another site in part or in whole, nor may any of its sub-programs be accessed from any page without the express written consent of the appropriate rights holder. Use of this site contractually obliges each user to these terms.

#### Privacy Policy

The Center for Public Integrity is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. The Center for Public Integrity collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. 

**Order**   
We request information from the user on our order form. Here a user must provide contact information (name and shipping address, for example) and financial information (credit card number and expiration date). This information is used exclusively for billing purposes or to fill a customer's order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. 

**Cookies**   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about him or her. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes his browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user need not log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, he may still use our site. The only drawback is that such a user will be limited in some areas of our site. 

**Log Files**   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user visits to our site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**   
We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Links**   
This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the Center for Public Integrity is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage those leaving our site to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Newsletter**   
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for such contact information as name and e-mail address. 

**Tell-A-Friend**   
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask for that friend's name and e-mail address. The Center for Public Integrity will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting him or her to visit the site. The Center for Public Integrity stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact the Center for Public Integrity at www.publicintegrity.org to request the removal of this information from the database. 

**Security**   
The Center for Public Integrity takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks a user to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number or Social Security number), that information is protected with SSL, the best encryption software in the industry. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon at the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when just "surfing." 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information—not just the sensitive information mentioned above—is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you may use our online form to contact the webmaster. 

**Special Offers**   
Established members will occasionally receive information about products, services, special deals, or our newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive such communications. Please see our "Choice/Opt-out" section below. 

**Choice/Opt-out**   
Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want to receive marketing material, can keep their e-mail address off our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter may opt-out of receiving these communications by sending an e-mail to majordomo@lists.publicintegrity.org; in the body of the message enter "unsubscribe public-i" (without the quotes). Once the request has been processed, an acknowledgment message will be sent. 

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of the privacy statement.
