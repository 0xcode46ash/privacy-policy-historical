# Privacy Policy | ICF International

ICF International, Inc. ("ICF International") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information and does not sell, rent, or trade personal information you provide to us through this Web site. "Personal Information" is information that would allow someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your full name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address. 

By accessing this Web site, you consent to the collection, usage, and storage of your personal information by us in the manner described below. If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/Contact_Us/contact.asp). We reserve the right to amend this policy at any time by posting the amended version on our Web site. We encourage you to learn as much as you can about your privacy on the Internet. This Privacy Policy covers the following issues and information:

  * How Personal Information is Collected and Used
  * The Privacy and Security of Your Personal Information
  * Web Site Linking Policy and Disclaimer
  * Children's Online Privacy Protection



##### How Personal Information is Collected and Used

Information is collected in two ways, directly and indirectly. We directly collect Personal Information from you when you submit an online form through our Web site or send an e-mail to us requesting information or assistance. If we collect Personal Information from you at any other time on our site, we state that Personal Information is being collected at that time and it is always a voluntary submission. 

Due to the open nature of the Internet, ICF International requests that no unsolicited proprietary or other confidential information be sent to it through the Web site. ICF International does not accept unauthorized idea submissions outside of established business relationships. Any such information supplied through the Web site will be deemed to be nonconfidential. 

Persons who supply us with their e-mail addresses or any other personal contact information online may receive e-mail or telephone contact from us for assistance, such as in response to queries from potential clients or in the employee recruitment process. Personal Information is used only by ICF International and, on some occasions, subcontractors of our firm who are involved with you in a client relationship. Our subcontractors are subject to strict contractual prohibitions on selling or sharing any Personal Information as well.

ICF International will not sell, rent, or trade personal information you submit to any third party. For example, we do not sell your e-mail address or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers or advertisers. The ICF International Web site does not contain or accept advertising of any kind, such as banner ads or other promotional intrusions.

Information is collected indirectly through the technology common to all Web sites. When you enter a URL, your browser requests a page from our server. At that time, the server automatically logs certain nonidentifiable information, such as time, date, browser type, and IP address. We study this aggregated data in our Internet access logs to help us tailor content toward your interests and needs. For instance, to determine the usefulness of a particular Web site feature, we may analyze collective traffic by visitors to this portion of our site. This collective data contains no personally identifiable information and is used to help us operate and enhance our site and services. 

##### The Privacy and Security of Your Personal Information

ICF International Group, Inc., owns and operates the ICF International Web site and servers and is the company that collects Personal Information through the Web site. The mailing address for [corporate headquarters](https://web.archive.org/Locations/default.asp) is 9300 Lee Highway, Fairfax, Virginia 22031 USA. We have established and maintain reasonable procedures to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your Personal Information. Our security measures are designed to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under our control. 

Your choice to disclose Personal Information in an e-mail submission or online form is voluntary. We cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other Personal Information will not be inadvertently disclosed to third parties. For example, although we take every precaution to maintain the security of our Web site and servers, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. At the discretion of ICF International, we may choose to disclose Personal Information or the content of an e-mail message to law enforcement, government officials, or other investigative personnel that we believe is necessary or appropriate in order to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries.

##### Web Site Linking Policy and Disclaimer

ICF International is not responsible for the content or accuracy of any third-party linked site that is not owned by ICF International or for any other links contained in such third-party sites. We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience only and for informational purposes. The inclusion of any link to a site not owned by ICF International is not an endorsement by ICF International of the site or its contents or accuracy and does not suggest that the opinions expressed on a third-party site are representative of the views or opinions of ICF International.

You may post a link to any portion of the ICF International Web site without written permission as long as ICF International is portrayed in a positive manner.

##### Children's Online Privacy Protection
