# Privacy Policy | ICF International

By accessing this Web site, you consent to the collection, usage, and storage of your personal information by us in the manner described below. If you have questions regarding this Privacy Policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact_us/contact.asp). Because the Web is an evolving medium, we reserve the right to amend this policy at any time by posting the amended version on our Web site and updating the Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to use this Web site after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

We encourage you to learn as much as you can about your privacy on the Internet. This Privacy Policy covers the following issues and information:

  * How Personal Information is Collected and Used

##### 

#### How Personal Information is Collected and Used

Information is collected in two ways: 

> 1) Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us  
>  2) Information Collected Automatically

##### 1) Information You Voluntarily Provide to Us 

We directly collect Personal Information from you when you submit an on-line form through our Web site or send an e-mail to us requesting information or assistance, such as through the submission of a contact form, signing up for a mailing list, downloading a white paper, or in the recruitment process. ICF International may also collect and store identifiable information about personal Web site usage via e-mail when you voluntarily follow a link from an e-mail to a feature on our Web site. We also directly collect Personal Information when you participate in a forum, such as submitting a comment on a blog. Individual data can be used to customize your view of the Web site in a registration-based area and to tailor information you receive from ICF. 

If we collect Personal Information from you at any other time on our site, we state that Personal Information is being collected at that time and it is always a voluntary submission. Due to the open nature of the Internet, ICF International requests that no unsolicited proprietary or other confidential information be sent to it through the Web site. ICF International does not accept unauthorized idea submissions outside of established business relationships. Any such information supplied through the Web site will be deemed to be nonconfidential. 

Persons who supply their e-mail addresses or any other personal contact information on-line may receive direct mail, e-mail, or telephone contact from us for assistance. If you decline to supply certain information while using the Web site, you may not be able to access select content or participate in some features.

ICF International will not sell, rent, or trade personal information you submit to any third party. For example, we do not sell your e-mail address or your name and personal demographic information to mass marketers or advertisers. Personal Information is used only by ICF International, its subsidiaries, and, on some occasions, subcontractors of our firm. Our subcontractors are subject to strict contractual prohibitions on selling or sharing any Personal Information as well. Please note that as our business evolves, we may buy or sell various assets, and information about our Web site visitors may be among the transferred assets.

Please note that when you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties on-line, such as on a blog, your information can be viewed, collected, and used by individuals and companies outside of ICF International. ICF International is not responsible for any unauthorized third party use of such information that is provided in a public forum.

##### 2) Information That is Collected Automatically

Information is collected indirectly through the technology common to all Web sites. When you enter a URL or a search query, or as you navigate through the site, your browser requests a page from our server. At that time, the server automatically logs certain non-identifiable information, such as time, date, browser type, and IP address. 

ICF International also uses standard “cookies” to enhance your experience on the Web site. Cookies are small files that your Web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to speed up performance, for instance, by remembering you and your preferences. You may choose to turn off cookies in your Web browser’s options, but it may reduce your ability to navigate the site and to access select content or participate in some features.

ICF International studies this data in our Internet access logs at both an aggregate and individual level to help us tailor content toward your interests and needs. For instance, to determine the usefulness of a particular Web site feature, we may analyze collective traffic to a portion of our site. This collective data contains no personally identifiable information and is used to help us operate and enhance our site and services.

#### Your California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our Web site visitors who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, details about their personal information (if any) that we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If applicable, this information would include a list of the categories of personal information that was shared and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared information in the immediately preceding calendar year. 

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:
