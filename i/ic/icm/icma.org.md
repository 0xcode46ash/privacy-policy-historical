**Please read this Privacy Policy carefully.**   Remember that your use of the Sites is at all times subject to our [Terms of Use](http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/about/terms_of_use), in which this Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made a part of those [Terms of Use](http://icma.org/en/icma/knowledge_network/about/terms_of_use).

**_WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT AND HOW IS IT COLLECTED?_**

**Types of Information We Collect.**

We collect several types of information from and about you and other users of our Sites, including: (i) personally identifiable information; and (ii) non-personally identifiable information, both as defined below:

**_Personally Identifiable Information:_**

Our definition of personally identifiable information includes any information that may be used to specifically identify or contact you, such as your name, postal and email addresses, phone number or bank, debit or credit card information. In certain circumstances, we may request, allow or otherwise provide you an opportunity to submit your personally identifiable information in connection with a feature, program, promotion, sale or some other aspect of our Sites. Certain information may not be personally identifiable when standing alone (e.g., your age), but may become so when combined with other information (e.g., your age and name). Whether or not you provide this information is your choice; however, in many instances this type of information is required to participate in the particular activity or service, realize a benefit we may offer or gain access to certain content through our Sites.

**_Non-Personal Information:_**

Our definition of non-personal information is any information that does not personally identify you. Non-personal information can include certain personally identifiable information that has been de-identified; that is, information that has been rendered anonymous. We obtain non-personal information about you from information that you provide us, either separately or together with your personally identifiable information. We also automatically collect certain non-personal information from you when you access our Sites. This information can include, among other things: (1) your IP address or other unique identifiers that are automatically assigned to your computer, mobile or other device used to access the Sites; (2) the domain name of your Internet service provider; (3) the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, etc.) and/or the operating system you are using (e.g., Vista, Windows XP, Mac OS, etc.); (4) the third party website from which your visit originated; (5) the search terms you use on our Sites; (6) the specific areas within our Sites that you visit; (7) the time of day and duration of your visits; and (8) the number of unique views received by the pages of the Sites. While not all of the information that we collect from users is personally identifiable, it may be associated with personally identifiable information that users also provide to us.

Additionally, certain information regarding your computer systems, network locations, IP address and software may be communicated to us in certain circumstances by the digital rights management systems associated with certain Content that you download or access via the Sites in order to prevent unauthorized use or distribution of the associated Content.

**Personal Information You Provide.**

We collect personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us. For example, we may collect your personal information, such as your name, address, email address, demographic information, and payment information, when you complete your online profile, submit a membership application, make a purchase such as a book or conference registration, complete a survey, send an email to us through our “[Contact Us](http://icma.org/en/icma/about/contact)” feature, make a donation, or provide information via paper forms or in-person interactions (e.g., making a purchase at an on-site conference).

**Content You Post.**

We allow users to post or provide content via the Sites, including questions, comments, blog posts, file uploads, document submission, and wiki contributions, (collectively, “ **User Postings** ”) and you may choose to contribute User Postings to our community and on our Sites. Because your User Postings are associated with your profile, they may be identifiable to us and to other users.  Please do not include any personal information as part of your User Postings, particularly sensitive information.  Your use our Sites and any features we offer at your own risk, and we cannot be held responsible for any use of the personal information that you may include as part of your User Postings.

**Technical Information Collected Automatically.**

We automatically record several types of technical information when you use our Sites, including through the following methods:

_Web server log information_ — Standard information automatically collected in web server logs, including but not limited to, IP address, web browser type, and pages accessed in order to create reports of common website metrics such as page views, time spent on a page, and clicks on a page.

_Cookies and other web technologies_ — Cookies are small textual identifiers used to identify your device when you visit one of our Sites. You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our Sites. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you direct your browser to our Sites. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the Sites. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser. You can choose to disable cookies on your browser or allow your browser to notify you when a cookie is being sent, however this may prevent you from utilizing certain features of the Sites. Other certain features of our Sites may use local stored objects (or “Flash” cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, from, and on our Sites. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as are used for browser cookies. Pages of our Sites and our e-mails may also contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity). We may also use cookies, web beacons, and other web technologies to maintain your preferences and security rights, and to provide traffic statistics via Google Analytics.  For more information about Google Analytics and your privacy options, see <http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html>.

_Advertising technologies  — _We may also allow other companies, called ad networks, to serve advertisements to users via the Sites. Ad networks include third party ad servers, ad agencies, ad technology vendors and research firms. We may “target” some ads to users that fit a certain general profile. To deliver these ads properly, the Sites may include a file from these ad networks within pages served by the Sites or implement other monitoring technologies so the networks may provide anonymous, aggregated auditing, research and reporting for advertisers as well as to target ads to you while you visit other websites. These general targets may also be used by ad networks to display targeted ads on other web sites as a substitute for random, irrelevant ads. In addition, the Sites may use the technology of ad networks to serve ads only when you visit this Sites. Ad networks may use non-personal information, such as your state or zip code, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of particular interest to you while you visit this Sites. Because your web browser must request these advertisements from the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit or set their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from their site. Currently, we work with Smart AdServer for Internet advertising technologies and services. Smart AdServer uses cookies designed to improve your online experience, including the display of more relevant ads. You can opt-out of Smart AdServer's cookie by visiting <http://www.smartadserver.com/diffx/optout/IABOptout.aspx>. For more information on Smart AdServer's privacy policy, see <http://smartadserver.com/company/privacy-policy/>.

_Email open and click-throughs_ — We collect information about whether you have opened email messages from us and/or clicked on links in those emails. This helps us evaluate the relevance of the content in our communications.

_Visits to shortcut website addresses_ — Some published website addresses such as ICMA.org/311 are shortcuts that redirect you to a page with a longer address. When a redirect is initiated, we log shortcut website address, date, time, and IP address.

_Log-ins and attempted log-ins_ — When you create a user account, log in, log out, or attempt to log in with invalid credentials, we record the date, time, your user ID (if you are logged in), IP address, the website address (URL) you accessed, web browser type, and a description of the event, which would include email address if you entered one as a username.

**_HOW IS THIS INFORMATION USED?_**

**Content and Feature Presentation and Development.**

We use the information we collect about you to administer and present the Sites and its Content to you, including to provide you with information, products, memberships, or services that you request from us, to fulfill any other purpose for which you provide it, to provide you with notices about your account/membership, including expiration and renewal notices, to allow you to participate in interactive features on our Sites, and for research regarding the effectiveness of the Sites and the business planning, marketing, advertising and sales efforts of our company and our trusted affiliates, independent contractors, and business partners.

We also use the information we collect about you to carry out our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts entered into between you and us, including for billing and collection.

We may also use the information we collect about you to generate reports on website activity and to conduct analysis for internal use.  The purpose of this analysis may include, but is not limited to, improving content and functionality, and customizing your experience on the Sites based on your activity and preferences.

**Marketing.**

We may use the information to contact you for market research and to inform you of products and services we offer. We may also use your information to contact you or allow third parties to contact you about third parties’ goods and services that may be of interest to you. We may send emails that may contain information regarding third party products or services; however, this does not necessarily mean that we have traded your personal information to any party.

We may use the information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to our advertisers’ target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your personal information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume that you meet its target criteria.

To learn how to change your marketing settings, please see the section below titled, “What choices do you have about how your information is shared?” To the extent applicable, to opt out of further communications from a marketing partner or sponsor with whom your information has been shared, please contact that partner directly.

**Aggregate Reports and Deductions.**

We reserve the right to create aggregate reports about your activity and may share these reports to third parties for the purposes of demonstrating the value of our Sites, selling advertising, or building partnerships with other organizations.

**Combining Information from Other Sources.**

We may combine the information we collect from you directly with other information about you that we collect from other sources. For example, we may import census data that would let us know the population of the community where you work. We may update or add to your record when we receive information about you from external sources such as data provided by other organizations with whom we work.

**Other Uses**.

We may also disclose your information to law enforcement and other governmental authorities pursuant to the section entitled “With whom may we share this information?”.

We may also use your information in any other way that we may describe when you provide the information or for any other purpose with your consent.

**_WITH WHOM MAY WE SHARE THIS INFORMATION?_**

**Affiliated Companies and Service Providers.**

We may disclose personally identifiable information collected from you and other users to our parent, subsidiary, and other related companies and trusted affiliates, to independent contractors, and to business partners who will use the information for the purposes outlined above, including as necessary to provide the Sites themselves, our mobile apps, the products and services offered by the Sites (including processing banking and credit card information for your transactions with us), to assist us with our advertising efforts, to help us analyze our data so that we can better understand usage trends and for the specific purposes for which the information was collected.

**State Associations and Other Nonprofit Organizations.**

We may share your personal information and other membership information (for example:  name, title, employer, mailing address, email address, business phone number, membership status, event registration status) with partnering nonprofit organizations, including without limitation state associations of local government management, the National League of Cities, the National Association of Counties and our licensee, ICMA-RC. Your information may be used by these other organizations for communications and to invite you to special events such as receptions at conferences.

**Candidates Seeking Election to the ICMA Board.**  
For only those users with memberships and that are eligible to vote to fill ICMA Board positions, petition candidates for the ICMA Board may purchase access to ICMA voting members’ email addresses for up to two email solicitations to those members. If you are an ICMA member, you may choose not to have your email address shared with petition candidates by changing your privacy and communication preferences in the “My Account” area of the website.  You can access this section by selecting the “My Account” link in the top right corner of all ICMA webpages.  

**Strategic Partners.**

We may share our membership lists with our corporate partners and their customers, and inform a corporate partner of the membership status of those customers. This enables our corporate partners to contact their customers who are also a member of our Sites for certain business purposes, such as participation in focus groups. We may also contact you on behalf of a corporate partner without sharing your contact information with the corporate partner.

**Mailing Lists Renters.**

We may share your information (e.g., your name, job title, and contact information) to a mailing list rental company, who may provide your information to organizations whose products or services may be of interest to you.  If you prefer not to be included on these lists, you may opt out using the methods outlined in the section titled, “What choices do you have about how your information is shared?”

**Legal Purposes and Required Disclosures.**

We may disclose information about you to law enforcement agencies, governmental officials or other third parties in response to a subpoena, court order or legal procedure.  We also reserve the right to disclose your information if we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to (1) prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss to us; (2) prevent or report suspected illegal activity; (3) protect anyone’s rights, property, or safety; or (4) enforce any of our terms and conditions.

**Merging or Acquiring Business Entities.**

We may share your information with other business entities, should we plan to merge with or be acquired by that business entity or in connection with a partial or total sale of assets, bankruptcy, or another corporate change.

**When You Otherwise Consent.**

We also reserve the right to share your information with third parties when you explicitly ask us or provide your consent to send your information to such third parties.

**_WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE ABOUT HOW YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED?_**

**Choices about what is Visible in Your Profile.**

When you create a profile on our Sites, we request that you submit certain personal information, including optional information like your birth date and gender. When you complete your user profile you will have the option of limiting what information is visible. You are not required to provide any optional information and it will not appear in our member directory if you so choose. Other personal information, however, such as when you select your home address or phone number as your primary address, will appear in the member directory. You will have the option of limiting what information is visible by logging in and clicking “Edit Profile” at the top right.  On the screen where you enter contact information, set the “Who can see this?” option at the right for each section of information.

**Choices about Whether Your Information is Shared with Other Organizations.**

You may choose not to have your contact information shared with certain third parties, such as state associations, affiliates, and our partnering nonprofit organizations.  You also may choose not to have your mailing information shared with our strategic partners and other private sector companies.  You may change your privacy and communication preferences by going to the “My Account” area of the site. You can access this section by selecting the “My Account” link in the top right corner of our Sites.

**_HOW WILL YOU BE INFORMED OF CHANGES IN THE PRIVACY POLICY?_**

We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy, in which case we will post the revised Privacy Policy on the Sites and update the Effective Date to reflect the date of the changes. When we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will strive to notify you (it is your responsibility to provide correct and updated contact information to ensure that you receive these notifications) or by posting a notice on homepage of the Sites, but you are expected to check this page each time you access the Sites, so you are aware of any changes, as they are binding on you. Your continued use of the Sites following the posting of revised Privacy Policy means that you accept and agree to the changes.

**_WHAT ABOUT LINKS TO THIRD PARTY WEBSITES?_**

This Privacy Policy applies only to our Sites.  Our Sites may link to websites that are not under our control.  For example, we may provide links to the websites of local governments, or links to social networking sites.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices at these third party websites or their use of your information.  We encourage you to review the privacy policies for these third party websites.

**_DO YOU COLLECT ANY INFORMATION ABOUT CHILDREN?_**

Our Sites are general audience websites and are not directed to children under the age of 13 and we restrict the use of our service to individuals age 18 and above (or 13 and above with parental consent).  No one under age 13 may provide any information to or on the Sites, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are under 13, do not use or provide any information on this Sites or on or through any of its features/register on the Sites, make any purchases or subscriptions through the Sites, use any of the interactive or public comment features of this Sites or provide any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, or any screen name or user name. If we learn we have collected or received personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information. If you believe we might have any information from or about a child under the age of 13, please contact us at:

**_WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IF I AM A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT?_**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us information about the personally identifiable information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to:

ICMA

Attn: Compliance Officer

777 North Capitol Street, NE  
Suite 500

Washington, DC 20002

Under California law, website and online service operators are also required to disclose how they respond to web browser “do not track” signals or other similar mechanisms that provide consumers the ability to exercise choice regarding the collection of personal information about a consumer’s online activities over time and across third party websites, to the extent the operator engages in that collection.  At this time, we do not track our customers’ personal information over time and across third-party websites and therefore this requirement does not apply to us.  California law also requires website and online service operators to disclose whether third parties may collect personal information about their users’ online activities over time and across different sites when the users use the operator’s website or service.  It is our policy not to permit unauthorized third parties to collect personal information directly from users on our Sites. 

**_WHAT ABOUT THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION ON THE SITES?_**

When you submit information to us through our Sites, you should be aware that your information is transmitted across the Internet and that no method of transmission over the Internet is completely or 100% secure. While we take reasonable precautions to protect your information, you also need to ensure you take appropriate steps to protect your information. We have implemented security measures we consider reasonable and appropriate to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Please be advised, however, that while we strive to protect your personally identifiable information, other information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online, and we are not responsible for the theft, destruction or inadvertent disclosure of your personally identifiable information or any other information. In the unfortunate event that your “personally identifiable information” (as the term or similar terms are defined by any applicable law requiring notice upon a security breach) is compromised, we may notify you by e-mail (at our sole and absolute discretion), to the last e-mail address you have provided us, in the most expedient time reasonable under the circumstances; provided, however, delays in notification may occur while we take necessary measures to determine the scope of the breach and restore reasonable integrity to the system as well as for the legitimate needs of law enforcement if notification would impede a criminal investigation. From time to time, we evaluate new technology for protecting information and, when appropriate, we upgrade our information security systems.

**_WHAT ABOUT WORLDWIDE TRANSFER AND PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION?_**

We, as the owner of the Sites, are based in the District of Columbia in the United States of America. We provide the Sites for use only by persons located in the United States. We make no claims that the Sites or any of its Content is accessible or appropriate outside of the United States. Access to the Sites may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries.

By providing us with personal information, you acknowledge and agree that your personal information may be transferred outside of the country from which you are accessing the Sites, including transferred outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), to the United States. Each of these countries has different privacy laws that afford varying levels of protection for your personally identifiable information, and such laws may not be as comprehensive as those that exist in the EEA. By registering on the Sites or otherwise using our Sites and services, you consent to our and our affiliates’ transmission to, and collection and processing of your information in, any jurisdiction, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
