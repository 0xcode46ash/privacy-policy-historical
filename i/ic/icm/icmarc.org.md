### Our Privacy Policy.

Protecting your privacy is important to us. In providing financial services and investment products to you, we collect certain nonpublic personal information about you. Our policy generally is to keep this information strictly confidential, and to use or disclose it as needed to provide services to you, or as permitted or required by law or by you. Our privacy policy applies equally to our former customers and investors, as well as individuals who simply inquire about the services or investments we offer. We may change this privacy policy in the future upon notification to you. 

### Information We Collect.

The nonpublic personal information we have about you includes information you give us when you open an account, invest in The Vantagepoint Funds, or write or call us, such as your name, address, social security number, employment, investment objectives and experience, financial circumstances, and investment transactions and holdings. 

### Information We Disclose.

We disclose nonpublic personal information about you to our affiliates, and to outside firms that help us provide services to you, for use only for that purpose. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information to nonaffiliated third party financial institutions with which we have established relationships, such as financial institutions that offer our affinity credit card program, or to other institutions with which we may establish relationships in the future in order to offer select financial products of interest to our customers. You have the right to stop us from disclosing nonpublic personal information about you to these parties, except as permitted or required by law. To do so, call us toll free at 1-800-827-2710. If you do not notify us that you wish to block disclosure of this nonpublic personal information, we will allow information to be sent to you from all third party financial institutions with which we have established relationships. Currently, ICMA Retirement Corporation has an established relationship with First USA Bank for its affinity credit card program. Before any additional third party relationships are added, they must be approved by the Board of Directors of the ICMA Retirement Corporation. Once approved, ICMA Retirement Corporation will notify you of any additional third party relationships in future publications of this privacy policy. 

### How We Safeguard Your Information.

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those persons who need to know it or who are permitted or required by law or by you to receive it. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your information.
