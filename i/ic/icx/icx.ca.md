It is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains an Internet privacy policy to protect your personal information on its ICX.CA website.

This web site consists of, and includes links to many sites including home pages of REALTORS® and real estate Boards and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display the CREA Privacy Policy statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this site, which do not display the CREA Privacy statement. Personal information that you choose to provide to other sites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites.

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this site, you may communicate extensively with a REALTOR® or Broker. The agent may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. The Canadian Real Estate Association also collects the e-mail address provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this web site, so we can respond to your questions or suggestions.

Similar to other commercial web sites, our web site utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our web site is used. Each time a visitor comes to the ICX.CA site, our web server collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address but not the e-mail address. This information may be consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with research firms and member Boards and Associations. The shared data will not disclose your identity or personal data and will not enable the recipients to contact you.

The data collected is also used to help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its visitors in order to improve the content and design of ICX.CA. Personal information will not be sold to any third parties, nor will such information be added to bulk e-mailing lists.

Any changes to the CREA Privacy Policy will be promptly communicated on this page. Policy changes will not alter how we handle previously submitted personal information.
