**General Internet Hazards**

You should be aware that receiving files from third parties, via any application (e.g. ICQ, email, etc.) may be harmful. Before receiving any files from any user, and even if the account from which the file transfer notice is sent looks familiar to you, it is strongly recommended that you verify that the person sending you these files is indeed the person you think he is, for example by asking him for some kind of information known only to the two of you. Please make sure not to receive files from users you do not trust, from users you are not sure they are whom they say they are or whenever you are not sure you want to receive the files. 

You should be aware that communications over the Internet are not secure unless they have been encrypted. ICQ does not encrypt your communications.
