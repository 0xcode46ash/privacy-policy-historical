In which circumstances can you exercise your rights with ICC?

  *  **Right of access**

    1. the purposes of the processing;
    2. the categories of personal data concerned;
    3. the recipients or categories of recipient to whom the personal data has been or will be disclosed, in particular recipients in third countries or international organisations;

    6. the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority;
    7. where the personal data is not collected from the data subject, any available information as to their source;
    8. the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject.
    9. Where personal data is transferred to a third country or to an international organisation, the data subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46 relating to the transfer.
    10. The controller shall provide a copy of the personal data undergoing processing. For any further copies requested by the data subject, the controller may charge a reasonable fee based on administrative costs. Where the data subject makes the request by electronic means, and unless otherwise requested by the data subject, the information shall be provided in a commonly used electronic form.
    11. The right to obtain a copy referred to in paragraph 3 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.


  *  **Right to rectification**



The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller without undue delay the rectification of inaccurate personal data. Taking into account the purposes of the processing, the data subject shall have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by means of providing a supplementary statement.

  *  **Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**


  1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies:
    1. the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which it was collected or otherwise processed;
    2. the data subject withdraws consent;
    3. the data subject objects to the processing on grounds relating to his or her particular situation including profiling and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing for direct marketing;
    4. the personal data has been unlawfully processed;
    5. the personal data has to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject.


  2. Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of the personal data.
  3. Paragraphs 1 and 2 shall not apply to the extent that processing is necessary:
  4. for exercising the right of freedom of expression and information;
  5. for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller;
  6. for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in so far as the right referred to in paragraph 1 is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing;
  7. for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.


  *  **Right to restriction of processing**


  1. The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller restriction of processing where one of the following applies:
    1. the accuracy of the personal data is contested by the data subject, for a period enabling the controller to verify the accuracy of the personal data;
    2. the processing is unlawful and the data subject opposes the erasure of the personal data and requests the restriction of its use instead;
    3. the controller no longer needs the personal data for the purposes of the processing, but it is required by the data subject for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
    4. the data subject has objected to processing on grounds relating to his or her particular situation including profiling pending the verification of whether the legitimate grounds of the controller override those of the data subject.
    5. Where processing has been restricted under paragraph 1, such personal data shall, with the exception of storage, only be processed with the data subject’s consent or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the Union or of a Member State.
    6. A data subject who has obtained restriction of processing pursuant to paragraph 1 shall be informed by the controller before the restriction of processing is lifted.


  *  **Notification obligation regarding rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing**



The controller shall communicate any rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing carried out to each recipient to whom the personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. The controller shall inform the data subject about those recipients if the data subject requests it.

  *  **Right to data portability**


  1. The data subject shall have the right to receive personal data which he or she has provided to a controller, in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format and have the right to transmit that data to another controller without hindrance from the controller to which the personal data has been provided, where:
    1. the processing is based on consent; and
    2. the processing is carried out by automated means.
    3. In exercising his or her right to data portability pursuant to paragraph 1, the data subject shall have the right to have the personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible.
    4. The exercise of the right referred to in paragraph 1 shall be without prejudice to the right of erasure. That right shall not apply to processing necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller.
    5. The right referred to in paragraph 1 shall not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others.


  *  **Right to object**


  1. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his/her particular situation, at any time to processing which is based on legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedom of the data subject. The controller shall no longer process the personal data, unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.
  2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing.
  3. Where the data subject objects to processing for direct marketing purposes, the personal data shall no longer be processed for such purposes.
  4. At the time of the first communication with the data subject, the right referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject and shall be presented clearly and separately from any other information.
  5. In the context of the use of information society services, and notwithstanding Directive 2002/58/EC, the data subject may exercise his or her right to object by automated means using technical specifications.
  6. Where personal data is processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, the data subject, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, shall have the right to object to processing of personal data concerning him or her, unless the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out for reasons of public interest.


  *  **Right to object to automated individual decision-making, including profiling**


  1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him/her or similarly significantly affects him/her.
  2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision:
    1. is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller;
    2. is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or
    3. is based on the data subject’s explicit consent.
    4. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his/her point of view and to contest the decision.


  *  **Right to unsubscribe**



If you no longer wish to receive communications from ICC, you may opt out by cancelling your subscription on the ICC Site through the link sent in each email you receive from ICC, or by sending an email to [dataprotection@iccwbo.org](mailto:dataprotection@iccwbo.org)

###  **9\. Cookies Policy**

  * General



Subject to your prior explicit consent where such consent is required by the applicable law in your jurisdiction, ICC Sites use “cookies” (i.e., small text files which are downloaded to a user’s device when visiting the ICC Sites) in order to improve navigation around the ICC Sites for the user and improve the quality of the ICC Sites.

By using <https://iccwbo.org/>, you consent to the use of cookies. If you do not consent to such use, you may disable these cookies through your browser.

  *  _Which cookies are we using?_
    * ICC uses cookies to save your logged in status and track that you have visited the site. This is useful for you and means that you do not have to login to access your preferences each time you visit the ICC website. This is also useful for us as it helps us gauge how many users have visited our site.



The Site also uses Google Analytics with the anonymizer function, a web analytics service provided by Google. Google Analytics collects first-party cookies, data related to the device/browser, IP address and on-site/app activities to measure and report statistics about user interactions on the websites and/or apps that use Google Analytics. Google Analytics uses IP addresses to derive the geolocation of a visitor, and to protect the service and provide security to our customers. When anonymizer function is enabled, Google Analytics uses only a portion of an IP address collected, rather than the entire address. The last octet of the user’s IP address prior to its use and storage is removed, which means that the full IP address is never written to disk. This does slightly reduce the accuracy of geographic reporting.  
More information on Google Analytics is available under: <https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245>
