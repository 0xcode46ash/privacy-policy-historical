# ICC Online Privacy Policy | ICC

### **Introduction**

The International Code Council, Inc., International Accreditation Service, Inc., ICC Evaluation Service, LLC, Solar Rating and Certification Corporation and their respective affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, "ICC," “we,” “us,” or “our”) are strongly committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Please carefully read the following Privacy Policy. Any person accessing, browsing or otherwise using any ICC Web site or online service (the "Site") either manually or via an automated device or program, shall be considered a "User." This Privacy Policy ("Policy") explains the type of information that ICC collects from our Users of the Site, what ICC does with that information, and with whom ICC shares this information.

###  **User Consent to Privacy Policy**

By accessing, browsing or using the Site, Users acknowledge that they have read, understand, agree and consent to the terms and conditions of the Policy. Users consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of User information, including information collected from or about you or the device you use to access the Site (together “Information”) pursuant to the terms of this Policy. **If you do not consent to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use this Site or otherwise provide Information to ICC.**

###  **The Information ICC Collects**

#### Information You Provide

ICC may collect Information when you use the Site or when you otherwise provide Information to ICC. ICC may collect the name, phone and fax number, mailing address, email address, credit card number, and any other personal information provided by a User who contacts ICC or any of ICC’s representatives through the Site, via email or otherwise, such as when a User: (a) submits an application for membership; (b) submits Information to become a volunteer; (c) submits Information at a seminar or other event; (d) purchases a product through the Site; (e) submits Information through our forums; (f) provides Information to ICC outside of the Site; or (g) engages in any other activity through the Site in which Information is provided to ICC.

ICC may also collect demographic information related to your professional expertise and experience, including your title, company name, industry, technical specialty, trade and/or organization(s)/associations(s) to which you belong.

By submitting Information to ICC on or through the Site, Users acknowledge that they have read this Policy, understand it, agree to its terms, and authorize ICC to collect, use and disclose Information pursuant to the terms of this Policy.

Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose Information through the Site, such as on message boards or in advertising or notices you post, that Information may be publicly viewable and can be collected and used by third parties without ICC’s knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties.

#### Automatically-Collected Information

ICC and certain third parties that advertise or provide other services on the Site may automatically collect certain information about the computer or devices (including mobile devices) you use to access the Site, such as when you use the Site or certain Site services, or click on advertisements on the Site or in ICC periodicals, such as the eNews or Building Safety Journal. For example, ICC and its partners and service providers may collect and analyze information such as: (a) your Internet Protocol address; (b) your mobile device ID; (c) your computer’s or mobile device’s operating system and version; (d) the name of the domain you used to access the Internet; and (e) information related to the ways in which you interact with the Site, such as: referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, the number of clicks, domain names, landing pages and content viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time you used the Site, the frequency of your use of the Site, error logs, and other similar information. This information is collected passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, and similar technologies, and is further explained below. As described further below, ICC may use third-party analytics providers and technologies, including cookies and similar tools, to assist in collecting this information. As we adopt additional technologies, we may also gather additional information through other methods.

 **Browser Cookies:** We and certain third party advertising partners may use “cookies.” When you use the Site, the pages you see, along with something called a “cookie,” may be downloaded to your computer, mobile device, or tablet (collectively, “Equipment”). Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your Equipment. These cookies may be used:  (a) to improve or enhance your experience using the Site; (b) to deliver content, including advertising, specific to your interests; and (c) for other purposes, such as security and administrative functions. For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, though different browsers may address cookies differently. Your browser may enable you to set your Equipment to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services or other features not being provided to you when you use that Equipment.

 **Flash Cookies:** We and certain ICC advertisers may choose to use Flash cookies in advertisements available on or through the Site or in ICC periodicals. Flash cookies, also called Flash Local Shared Objects, are used by the Adobe Flash Player to store user preferences. Flash cookies operate differently than browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser may not remove flash cookies. More information concerning flash cookies, including how to remove them from your computer or device is available at [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html).

 **Web Beacons, Pixels and Clear GIFs:**   We and our advertising partners may use web beacons, pixels and clear GIFs. These electronic technologies are transparent image files that, if used, allow us and our advertising partners to track Web site usage information, such as the number of times a given web page has been viewed and whether and when you have opened a HTML email, how many times the email was forwarded and which links in the email were clicked. Unlike cookies, these technologies are not placed on your Equipment. We and our advertising partners use information collected through Web beacons, pixels, and clear GIFs to improve and enhance our Site and measure the effectiveness of these communications with you. These technologies may be used in association with cookies to understand how visitors interact with the Site or advertisements made by our advertising partners.

#### Information from Third Parties

ICC may obtain additional information about you from third parties such as marketers, partners, researchers, and others. We may combine Information that we collect from you with Information that we obtain from such third parties and Information derived from any other product or service we provide.

#### Aggregate or De-Identified Data

ICC may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Site or via other means so that the data is not intended to identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified data is not subject to any restrictions under this Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.

###  **How ICC Uses the Information**

ICC uses the Information collected from its Users for the following purposes:

  * For the purposes for which you provided it;
  * To respond to Users’ questions and/or comments;
  * To provide products, services or information to Users;
  * To process a User’s purchase;
  * To provide a User with details of his or her account status;
  * To notify a User about new features of the Site, or products, services, special offers, or other information that we believe will be of interest to a User;
  * To perform analytics and research used in marketing, promotion, or similar activities;
  * To monitor Site performance and perform analytics and research aimed at improving the accuracy, effectiveness, usability, or popularity of the Site;
  * To enforce the legal terms that govern a User’s use of the Site;
  * To prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities;
  * To administer sweepstakes and contests;
  * To ensure that ICC complies with applicable laws.



###  **ICC Sharing of your Information**

ICC may, without limitation, share your Information with any agent or company that is part of ICC. ICC only will share Information that it collects or receives regarding its Users with non-affiliated third parties under the following circumstances.

  *  **Consent:** If ICC has a User’s consent to share any Information, it may do so. For example, if a User agrees to have their Information posted in the Members Only area of the Site, that User consents to ICC sharing their Information with other ICC Members. We may also share a User’s Information to provide that User with services or products that the User has requested.
  *  **Agents:** ICC may utilize other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf, such as marketing new or additional ICC products and services, sending postal and email to Users, transmitting text messages requested by Users, processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, delivering products and services, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  *  **Sweepstakes and Contests:** When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your Information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, or sponsors and the use of that Information may also be governed by those advertisers’, operators’, or sponsors’ privacy policies or practices.
  *  **Aggregate Data:** ICC may aggregate and/or de-identify information collected by the Site or via other means so that the data is not intended to identify you. Our use and disclosure of aggregated and/or de-identified data is not subject to any restrictions under this Policy, and we may disclose it to others without limitation for any purpose.
  *  **Advertising and Analytics:** As described in the section on Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising, ICC also may provide automatically-collected information to third parties for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements and performing analytics.
  *  **Protection of ICC or Others:** ICC may disclose your Information to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, to protect the rights, property or safety of ICC or others, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud.
  *  **Business Transfers:** We may share your Information in connection with any actual or proposed merger, reorganization, or sale of some or all ICC assets, or a financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our assets or business by another company.
  *  **Third Parties Providing Relevant and Valuable Products and Services:** From time to time, ICC may share your Information with other organizations that provide products or services that we believe Users will find relevant, valuable and interesting.



### Online Analytics and Tailored Advertising

#### Online Analytics

We may use third-party web analytics services on our Site, such as those of Google Analytics. These service providers use the sort of technology described in Section 1.2 to help us analyze how users use the Site, including by noting the third-party Web site from which you arrive. The information (including your IP address) collected by the technology will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers, who use the information to evaluate your use of the Site. We also use Google Analytics for certain purposes related to advertising, as described in the following section. To prevent Google Analytics from using your information for analytics, you may install the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on by clicking [here](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

#### Tailored Advertising

Also, third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised via the Site may also place cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device to collect information about your use of the Site in order to (i) inform, optimize, and serve ads based on past visits to our Web sites and other sites and (ii) report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our Web sites and use of our Site. We also allow other third parties (e.g., ad networks and ad servers such as Google Analytics, DoubleClick and others) to serve tailored ads to you on the Site, and to access their own cookies or other tracking technologies on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Site. [We also may share with third-party advertisers a hashed version of your email address, solely in non-human readable form and content that you share publicly when using the Site (e.g, user-generated content) for purposes of delivering tailored advertising.] We neither have access to, nor does this Policy govern, the use of cookies or other tracking technologies that may be placed on your computer, mobile phone, or other device you use to access the Services by non-affiliated, third-party ad technology, ad servers, ad networks or any other non-affiliated third parties. Those parties that use these technologies may offer you a way to opt out of ad targeting as described below. You may receive tailored advertising on your computer through a web browser. If you are interested in more information about tailored browser advertising and how you can generally control cookies from being put on your computer to deliver tailored advertising, you may visit the [Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices) , the [Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out link](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/) or [TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices Page](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) to opt-out of receiving tailored advertising from companies that participate in those programs. You may also use the links available in advertisements that appear in the Site to learn more about advertising practices on our Site.

To opt out of Google Analytics for display advertising or customize Google display network ads, you can visit the Google [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) page. Please note that to the extent advertising technology is integrated into the Site, you may still receive advertisements even if you opt-out of tailored advertising. In that case, the ads will just not be tailored.  Also, we do not control any of the above opt-out links and are not responsible for any choices you make using these mechanisms or the continued availability or accuracy of these mechanisms.

When using a mobile application you may also receive tailored in-application advertisements. Each operating system, iOS for Apple phones, Android for Android devices and Windows for Microsoft devices provides its own instructions on how to prevent the delivery of tailored in-application advertisements. You may review the support materials and/or the privacy settings for the respective operating systems in order to opt-out of tailored in-application advertisements. For any other devices and/or operating systems, please visit the privacy settings for the applicable device or contact the applicable platform operator.

### California Do-Not-Track Disclosure Requirements

ICC is committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our Site for third-party purposes, and that is why we provide above the Network Advertising Initiative’s “Consumer Opt-out” link, Digital Advertising Alliance’s Consumer Opt-Out Link, TRUSTe’s Advertising Choices page, and the Google opt-out link in this Policy. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated Do Not Track signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working on Do Not Track standards, implementations and solutions.

### International Users

Information that is submitted to this Site will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law. If you are a non-U.S. User, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your Information and disclose it to other entities outside your resident jurisdiction, as discussed in “ICC Sharing of Your Information” above. In addition, such Information may be stored on servers located outside your resident jurisdiction. U.S. law may not provide the degree of protection for Information that is available in other countries. By providing us with your Information, you acknowledge that you have read this Policy, understand it, agree to its terms, and consent to the transfer of such Information outside your resident jurisdiction.

### Accessing or Changing Your Personal Information

ICC allows you to change or correct inaccuracies to certain Information collected from you by logging into your account on the Site and making changes to your Information. Your account information can be accessed through the “My ICC” links on the Site.

### Choices for Use or Sharing of Certain Information

ICC values your concerns about the privacy of your Information. Therefore, we offer you the opportunity to opt out of use or sharing of certain Information. For information that is shared with third parties, you should be able to opt-out of receiving further promotions from these third parties by unsubscribing to their email correspondence to you or contacting them directly. ICC is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties who may send you correspondence.

Any emails sent by ICC subject to the CAN SPAM Act will include an option to unsubscribe from further correspondence. In addition, you can always opt-out of receiving commercial emails from ICC [here](http://www.iccsafe.org/content/icc-email-preference-center/). Please note that even if you opt-out from receiving certain email from ICC, you will continue to receive transactional messages, such as messages conforming a product purchase, an event you registered for and certain essential ICC membership information.

You may also access your “My ICC” profile to change what profile information is displayed to other ICC Members or to the public. Please note, however, that the visibility of some profile information, such as your name and location, cannot be changed through “My ICC.”

### Linked Internet Web Sites

The Site provides hyperlinks, which are highlighted words or pictures within a hypertext document, including advertisements that, when clicked, take you to another place within the document, to another document altogether, or to other Web sites not controlled by ICC. These hyperlinked Web sites may contain privacy provisions that are different from those provided herein. ICC is not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of information collected through these Web sites, and ICC expressly disclaims any and all liabilities related to such collection, use, or disclosure.

### Children’s Privacy Protection

The Site is not directed towards children under 13 years of age, and ICC does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age through the Site. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not permitted to submit information to ICC through the Site.

### Security

ICC implements measures to protect Information that is submitted to ICC and is under its control. These measures vary on the sensitivity of the information that ICC collects and stores. You should be aware, however, that ICC has no control over the security of other Web sites that you might visit or use even when a link to those Web sites is available on or through the Site. If you share your Equipment or use Equipment that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser when you finish using the Site.

No system can be completely secure. Therefore, ICC makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of its security measures. ICC shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages that result from a lapse in compliance with this Policy as a result of a security breach or technical malfunction. Certain information may be transmitted to you by email. Although it may be illegal to intercept or disclose these messages under U.S. Federal law, these transmissions are not secure. In addition, Users’ communications through the Site are, in most cases, viewed only by you and anyone to whom you address your message. As the operator of the Site, ICC may need to review or monitor your electronic mail and other communications from time to time as may be required by law, but it has no obligation to do so. Therefore, you should not expect to have a right to privacy in any of your electronic communications.

In accordance with applicable law , ICC will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps in the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your personal information. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es) we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your personal information. Please refer to the [Federal Trade Commission’s Web site](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm) for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

### Codes and Standards Discussion Forum and eMail Discussion Lists

Certain services provided on the Site, such as the Codes and Standards Discussion Forum and eMail Discussion Lists, are provided by third parties for ICC and its Users. Use of these services is subject to the specific terms and conditions and privacy policies that are provided to a User when signing up these services. Users acknowledge that the collection, use and disclosure of their Information is subject to these policies when using the Codes and Standards Discussion Forum and eMail Discussion Lists.

### Amendments to Privacy Policy

We may occasionally update this Policy, as noted by the “effective date” at the end of the Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Policy to stay informed about our collection, use, and disclosure of Information. Your continued use of the Site constitutes your agreement to this Policy and any updates.
