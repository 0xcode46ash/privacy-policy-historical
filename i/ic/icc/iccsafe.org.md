ICC Online Privacy Policy 

## Introduction

The International Code Council, Inc. and its affiliates (collectively "ICC") are strongly committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. Please carefully read the following Privacy Policy. Any person accessing, browsing or otherwise using this Web site located at [www.iccsafe.org](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Site") either manually or via an automated device or program, shall be considered a "User." The purpose of this Privacy Policy ("Policy") is to explain the type of information that ICC collects from our Users, what ICC does with that information, and with whom ICC shares this information.

 **User Consent to Privacy Policy**

By accessing, browsing or using the Site, Users acknowledge that they have read, understand, agree and consent to the terms and conditions of the Policy. Users consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of User information including personal and non-personal information and anonymous browsing information (together "Information") pursuant to the terms of this Policy. ******If you do not consent to these terms and conditions, please do not access, browse, or use this Site or provide Information to ICC.**

## The Information ICC Collects

**  
Anonymous Browsing Information and Non-Personal Information**

Users can browse the Site without revealing personal information. In this context, our servers or the servers of advertising partners may collect certain anonymous browsing information, such as your Internet Protocol address, your computer's operating system, the name of the domain you used to access the Internet, the Web site you came from and the Web site you visit next. This information is collected passively through the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs, and similar technologies and is further explained in the Cookies section below. Anonymous browsing information is not used, nor is it intended to be used to personally identify an individual. 

ICC may also collect non-personal demographic information related to your professional expertise and experience, including your title, company name, industry, technical specialty, trade and/or organization(s)/associations(s) to which you belong. 

**Personal Information**

ICC may collect the name, phone and fax number, mailing address, email address, credit card number, and any other personal information provided by a User who contacts ICC or any of ICC's representatives through the Site, via email or otherwise, submits an application for membership, submits personal information at a seminar or other event, purchases a product through the Site, or engages in any other activity through the Site in which personal information is provided to ICC.

By submitting Information to ICC on or through the Site, Users acknowledge that they have read this Policy, understand it, agree to its terms and authorize ICC to collect, use and disclose Information pursuant to the terms of this Policy.

## How ICC Uses the Information 

ICC uses the Information collected from its Users to respond to Users' questions and/or comments, provide products, services or information to Users, process a User's purchase, or provide related account status. Anonymous browsing, non-personal and personal information may be used to gather broad demographic information used in marketing, promotion, analytics, or similar activities. This information may be aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent, page views and other statistics about Users of the Site. ICC also may use this data to monitor Site performance and to make the Site easier and more convenient to use. ICC may also use Information collected from its Users to enforce its agreements with Users, prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities, for other legally permissible purposes and generally to ensure that ICC complies with applicable laws. 

## ICC Sharing of your Information

ICC only will share Information that it collects or receives regarding its Users with third parties under the following circumstances.

  * **Consent:** If ICC has a User's consent to share any Information, it may do so. This includes ICC Members who agree to have their Information posted in the Members Only area of the Site. 
  * **Agents:** ICC may utilize other companies and individuals to perform functions on its behalf such as marketing new or additional ICC products and services, sending postal and email to Users, processing credit card payments, fulfilling orders, delivering products and services, and providing customer service. These third parties have access to Information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. 
  * **Aggregate Anonymous Information:** ICC may provide to others the aggregate statistics about our Users' site activity for purposes of marketing, promotion, analytics or similar activities. None of these statistics will identify Users personally. ICC also may provide anonymous browsing information to Clearspring Technologies through the AddThis Platform for purposes of delivering targeted advertisements. See Cookies section below for more information.
  * **Protection of ICC or Others:** ICC may disclose Information about our Users to others if we have a good faith belief that we are required or permitted to do so by law or legal process, to respond to claims, to protect the rights, property or safety of ICC or others, or take action regarding illegal activities or suspected fraud. 
  * **Business Transfers:** In the event that ICC decides to sell all or part or its assets, ICC reserves the right to include Information among the assets transferred to the acquiring company. 
  * **Affiliates:** ICC may share personal, non-personal and anonymous browsing information with its affiliates, including without limitation, International Accreditation Service, Inc., ICC Evaluation Service, LLC., and the International Code Council Foundation.
  * **Third Parties Providing Relevant and Valuable Products and Services:** From time to time, ICC may share your Information with other organizations that provide products or services that we believe Users will find relevant, valuable and interesting.



## Cookies

ICC and certain third parties that advertise or provide other services on the Site may automatically collect certain types of passive, anonymous information whenever you use the Site, certain Site services, or click on advertisements on the Site or in ICC periodicals, such as the eNews or Building Safety Journal. If ICC or these third parties collect this anonymous information, it will be done passively through  the use of certain electronic technologies, such as cookies, web beacons, pixels, clear GIFs and similar technologies as explained below. 

> **_HTML Cookies_** : We and certain third party advertising partners may use “cookies.” When you use the Site, the pages you see, along with something called a "cookie," may be downloaded to your computer, mobile device, or tablet (collectively, “Equipment”).

For example, cookies are used to store your preferences for certain types of information so that you do not have to input those preferences every time you use the Site. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you usually can change your browser to limit or prevent cookies. Cookies in themselves do not personally identify the individual user, but rather the Equipment that is being used to access the Site. You may have the opportunity to set your Equipment to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or to not receive cookies at any time. Different browsers may address cookies differently. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, it may result in certain personalized services not being provided to you when you use that Equipment. **__**
