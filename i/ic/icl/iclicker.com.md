The functionality of our site may let you share a page of our site with a friend.  In order to share a page, we will ask for your name and e-mail address, and your friend’s e-mail address.  We will not use your friend’s e-mail address other than to forward the page on your behalf.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small text files that Web sites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize a computer when a user of that computer returns to a Web site that was visited previously. We use cookies on our Web site, to help us administer certain site features. We may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your log-in information. The “help” portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, in order to use certain features of our Web site, users must have the “cookie” function on their browsers enabled.

**Other Passive Collection Information** ** **

When you visit our Web site, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using, your originating domain, your web browser type, and your computer operating system.

i>clicker may use standard Internet technology, such as log files, web beacons and other similar technologies to track your use of iclicker.com. If you are a registered user of our Web site, this information may be associated with your user name or id. i>clicker also may include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages and newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services that are offered to our visitors/customers, to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our content, programming, promotional e-mails, marketing, and other activities.

**How We Use Information We Collect**

Information collected through our Web site is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted (for example, to contact you if you win a sweepstakes or contest, to allow you to participate in a chat room, to contact you with an answer to a question, or to send you information or a product you’ve requested).  We may also contact you as a user of our products to: ask you to serve as a reviewer; to request an appointment with you at your campus or at a conference to talk about an existing or planned product; and other similar kinds of feedback and discussion. We may also use the information we collect to send you information or products we think may be of interest to you, and to customize our contacts with you.  Finally, we may use some of the information we collect to analyze Web site use and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers.

**Information We Share**

We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. If we describe more limited sharing practices in connection with your use of a specific product or service anywhere on our Web sites, those more limited practices will apply as to that product or service only. We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to i>clicker through common ownership. We also share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities, such as contests or promotions, with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Web site visitors with them. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**Links to Other Web sites**

We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience. Also, on occasion, we may provide to a department, program, class or instructor access to a third-party Web site (which may also include access to third-party software). These sites may operate independently from i>clicker, and may not be under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We may not be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.

**Children’s Privacy**

We do not target or knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If our policy concerning collection of information from children under 13 changes, we will revise this portion of our privacy notice and will comply with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

**Security**

We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect information in our possession and control against foreseeable hazards. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.
