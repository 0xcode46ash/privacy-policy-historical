**Customer Support**  
We may offer content, products and services to our adopting customers (e.g., adopting instructors, school administrators, company administrators). A user account may be necessary to get access to and/or support for such content, products and services. To create a user account, you will need to enter your name and e-mail address. You will also need to establish a password of your choosing. We may require additional information to confirm your status as an adopting customer (e.g., your school/company name and location, course/department information,  and a telephone number where we can contact you). In addition, you may choose to provide optional information (e.g., your areas of interest), which will allow us to serve you better.

**Student Registration**  
Instructors may ask you to register your i>clicker to your name/student ID.  Such registration is necessary for instructors to assign credit to you for participating in class and/or selecting correct answers using the i>clicker.  If you choose to register online, you will need to register your name, i>clicker ID and student ID (as designated by your instructor).  

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Other Promotions**  
From time to time we may run sweepstakes, contests or other promotions on our Web site. If you choose to participate, we may request your contact and other information in connection with the promotion.

**Surveys and Questionnaires**  
We may ask visitors to our Web site to complete online surveys and opinion polls on a variety of topics, such as their activities, attitudes, and interests, and our products and services. These surveys help us understand the needs of our visitors.

**Chat Rooms, Forums, Blogs and Discussion Groups**  
We may host chat rooms, forums, blogs and/or discussion groups (including by e-mail, bulletin board, instant messaging or other technologies) on our own or on third-party Web sites. If you choose to participate in a chat room, forum, blog or discussion group, we may request certain information such as your e-mail address, date of birth, academic status and affiliation, and other pertinent information. Please be aware that some or all the information you provide (including personally identifiable information such as your name) in connection with a chat room, forum, blog or discussion group may be available to specific groups or to the public generally, depending upon the technologies used.

**"Contact Us" and Technical Support**  
You may choose to contact us through our Web site. If you e-mail us comments or questions, we will have your e-mail address, as well as any other information you choose to provide.

**Newsletters and Updates**  
You may sign up for e-mail alerts such as i>news and other newsletters or updates on a variety of topics such as software and other developments involving i>clicker.

**Cookies**  
We use cookies on our Web site, to help us administer certain site features. Cookies are small text files that Web sites often store on the computer hard drives of visitors to their sites. A cookie contains a unique code, which is used to recognize a computer when a user of that computer returns to a Web site that was visited previously. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to stop accepting new cookies, how to be notified when you receive a new cookie, and how to disable existing cookies. However, in order to use certain features of our Web site, users must have the “cookie” function on their browsers enabled.  
**  
Other Passive Collection Information**  
When you visit our Web site, your browser automatically sends us certain Internet-related information, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you’re using and your originating domain.

We also use log files to collect certain aggregate information about Web site use, such as how many users visited our site, the average time spent on the site and the pages viewed. By collecting this information, we learn how best to tailor our Web sites to our visitors. While we generally examine such information only in the aggregate, such information could be linked back to individual IP addresses. In addition, if you are a registered user of our Web site, this information may be associated with your user name or id.

**How We Use Information We Collect**  
Information collected through our Web site is used in connection with the purpose for which it was submitted (for example, to contact you if you win a sweepstakes or contest, to allow you to participate in a chat room, to contact you with an answer to a question, or to send you information or a product you've requested).

We may also contact you as a user of our products to: ask you to serve as a reviewer; to request an appointment with you at your campus or at a conference to talk about an existing or planned product; and other similar kinds of feedback and discussion. We may also use the information we collect to send you information or products we think may be of interest to you, and to customize our contacts with you.

Finally, we may use some of the information we collect to analyze Web site use and to do other internal analyses, such as market research, that will allow us to better meet the needs of our customers.

**Information We Share**  
We do not sell, rent, trade or otherwise disclose personal information about our Web site visitors, except as described here. If we describe more limited sharing practices in connection with your use of a specific product or service anywhere on our Web sites, those more limited practices will apply as to that product or service only. We may share the information you provide with companies that are related to i>clicker through common ownership. We also share information provided by our Web site visitors with service providers we have retained to perform services on our behalf. In addition, we may share information about you with non-affiliated third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you. These third parties may contact you about their products and services. We will not share your information with these third parties for their own marketing purposes if you request that we not do so. We may, however, engage in joint marketing activities, such as contests or promotions, with selected third parties and may share personal information about our Web site visitors with them. In addition, we may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law, (ii) in response to legal process, (iii) to law enforcement authorities or other government officials, or (iv) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.

We reserve the right to transfer any information we have about you in the event we sell or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. Should such a sale or transfer occur, we will use reasonable efforts to try to ensure that the transferee uses personal information you have provided through this Web site in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice.

**Links to Other Web sites**  
We provide links to other Web sites for your convenience. Also, on occasion, we may provide to a department, program, class or instructor access to a third-party Web site (which may also include access to third-party software). These sites may operate independently from i>clicker, and may not be under our control. These sites may have their own privacy notices in place, which we strongly suggest you review if you visit any linked Web sites. We may not be responsible for the content of these sites, any products or services that may be offered through these sites, or the privacy practices of these sites.

**Security**  
We use administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect information in our possession and control against foreseeable hazards. Please note, however, that perfect security does not exist on the Internet.

**Your Choices About Marketing**  
We give you the option of requesting that we not share personal information about you with third parties that are unrelated by common ownership with i>clicker for marketing use. Click here if you DO NOT want us to share your personal information with unrelated third parties for their own marketing use.

We also give you the option of requesting that we not share your information with companies related to i>clicker by common ownership for marketing use. However, PLEASE NOTE that, because of the integrated nature of the businesses of i>clicker and some of these companies, if you opt out of sharing with them, you will also automatically be opted out of marketing use by i>clicker. That means that you will not receive information about new products, promotions and services from i>clicker. Click here if you do not want us to share your information with related companies for marketing use (or use the information for marketing purposes ourselves). (Keep in mind, however, that some of our related companies may have independently obtained your information, in which case you may continue to receive communications from those companies, unless you opt out directly with them.)

Please be aware that we are able to effectuate an opt-out only for a specific e-mail address, or for a name and address or other identifying information. For example, we are unable to opt out "John Smith" by name alone, because of the large number of persons by that name in our databases. So, if you have more than one e-mail address, if you move or change jobs, or if the information you provide us when opting out doesn't match the information in our databases, your opt out request may not be effectuated properly. If you believe you have opted out, but continue to receive e-mails from us, please contact us by one of the means listed under "How to Contact Us", below, and we will endeavor to resolve the issue.

**Updates to this Privacy Notice**  
We may change or update portions of this Privacy Notice at any time and without prior notice to you. Please check back from time to time so you are aware of any changes or updates to the Notice. We will indicate above the effective date of the Notice.
