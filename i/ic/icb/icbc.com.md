# Our privacy policy

We're dedicated to protecting your privacy. It's an essential part of our commitment to integrity, dedication, accountability and caring whenever we deal with our customers. 

The B.C. Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) sets out rules around ICBC’s ability to collect, use and disclose personal information. It also requires us to protect your personal information by keeping it secure.

“Personal information” includes any recorded information about you as an identifiable individual such as your name, address, driving record, or claims information. It would not include things that cannot be linked back to you, such as crash statistics for an intersection with names and identifying features of individuals removed.

The purpose of our Privacy Policy is to:

  * help you understand ICBC’s privacy commitments, and

  * give you information about where you can go with questions or concerns about privacy.
