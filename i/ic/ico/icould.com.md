# Privacy policy - icould : icould

This page explains the types of personal data we may collect about you. It also explains how we store and handle that data, and keep it safe.

### Personal Data

Personal data is any information that relates to a living person who can be identified from that data.

We respect your privacy and store your personal data securely. We do not share your personal data with anyone else (third parties).

We hold three types of personal data:

**Mailing list subscriber data  
**You can subscribe to our mailing list to keep up to date with our news and to receive careers information. We hold details of your name, email address and how you describe your interest in careers (exploring own career interests, teacher or careers professional, other).

The data and consent are stored and processed by [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy/).

You can unsubscribe from our mailing list at any time.

**Site login data**  
You can register with icould.com to manage your favourite videos and interests. To do this you need to provide an email address and password. This information is stored on our server.

You can also login using an account you have with a social media or other company that we do not control. You need to check with them how they use your data.

**Career video data**  
Anyone who is featured in an icould video signs a consent form for use of their image and sound. The consent form can include name, email address, contact number and job title. We  hold a paper copy of this data and may also hold a digital version on our computer system.
