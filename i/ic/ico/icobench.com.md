# Privacy Policy | ICObench

Your privacy is critically important to us. At ICObench, we have a few fundamental principles:  
\- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.  
\- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.

Below is our privacy policy, which incorporates these goals.

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us.

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, ICObench collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. ICObench’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how ICObench’s visitors use its website. From time to time, ICObench may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

ICObench also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comment. ICObench only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that expert IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the website.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to ICObench’s websites choose to interact with ICObench in ways that require ICObench to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that ICObench gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up as experts and/or sign up for newsletters and/or submit ICOs to provide an email address. In each case, ICObench collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with ICObench. ICObench does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

ICObench may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. ICObench may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, ICObench does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

ICObench discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on ICObench’s behalf or to provide services available at ICObench’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using ICObench’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Some of these services include commercially available remarketing services (for e.g. Facebook Custom Audience). ICObench will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, ICObench discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request. If you have submitted your email address for newsletters or you have registered as an expert on the website, ICObench may occasionally send you an email to tell you about news, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with ICObench. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. ICObench takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

ICObench visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using ICObench’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of ICObench’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If ICObench’s, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired right to use user`s information is transferred to acquirer. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ICObench may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

## Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by ICObench and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
