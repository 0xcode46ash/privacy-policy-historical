This Privacy Policy applies to information that we collect and maintain about you when you visit [www.iContact.com](http://www.icontact.com/ "Email Marketing and Social Media Marketing Software - iContact") ("Site") and when you use our services, as well as information collected from other sources, such as information you provide at tradeshows or seminars or to our business partners.

## What Type of Data Do We Collect?

Generally, we collect or maintain the following categories of data: 

  * **Customer Registration Data** : when a customer, whether an individual or an entity, activates our services, creates an account at the Site or registers at an event we collect account information from that customer, which we refer to in this Policy as "Customer Registration Data." The Customer Registration Data we collect includes individual or contact name, company name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, as well as information about services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We also assign customers a unique username and password to access their account information through the Site;
  * **Customer Message Recipient Data** : we also maintain data that has been provided to us or uploaded to the Site by our customers, which we refer to in this Policy as "Customer Message Recipient Data." Typically, Customer Message Recipient Data relates to individuals or entities who have opted in to receive email messages or other types of communications from our customers, and may include name, e-mail address, contact information, and other information. Under our Anti-Spam Policy, customers must obtain a recipient's consent prior to sending the recipient an e-mail through our service. For more information, please see the section below entitled "Why Do You Receive E-mails"; and
  * **Site Data** : we use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site and users of our services, which we refer to in this Policy as "Site Data." The Site Data we collect includes browser type, operating system and IP address, as well as information of the web pages viewed and links clicked by visitors and/or customers. We may combine Site Data with other data we have collected from users, such as Customer Registration Data.



Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the Customer Registration Data submitted or maintained by us may identify or relate to an individual ("personal data"), rather than a business. 

## How Do We Use the Data We Collect?

We may use the information we collect and maintain, including any personal data, for the following purposes: 

  * If you have provided your contact information to us, we may use such information to contact you for marketing and promotional purposes by various means, including regular mail, email or telephone. If we receive your express consent, we may also send you pre-recorded messages or SMS text messages.
  * To process orders, requests and payments, and to communicate with our customers about their accounts or any requests, orders or payments;
  * To provide requested services to our customers. The services we provide to our customers may include certain marketing and promotional services, including sending or facilitating the delivery of communications on behalf of and at the request of our customers. In such cases, our customers are responsible for the content and delivery of such communications.
  * To respond to any inquiries submitted to us and to provide technical support to customers and Site visitors.
  * To tailor the content and information that we may send or display to customers or Site visitors, to display targeted advertisements, and to otherwise personalize experiences at the Site;
  * To better understand how users access and use our Site and services, both on an aggregate and individualized basis, for the purposes of improving our Site and services and responding to customer and visitor desires and preferences; and
  * To detect violations of applicable policies. For example, we may use automated filters to screen the content of e-mails sent by or on behalf of our customers in order to restrict the sending of pornography or other prohibited content. We may also track or screen certain e-mail activities, such as the importation of large e-mail lists or the receipt of returned e-mails, to detect and prevent illegal spamming activities.



## How Do We Disclose the Data We Collect?

We do not sell, rent or trade personal information, whether Customer Information or Customer Recipient Data, without prior consent. We may however, disclose the information we collect or maintain, including personal information, without prior consent as described below:

  * **Service Providers**. We may disclose the information we collect from you to third- party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform the following functions on our behalf: such as credit card processing to bill you for goods and services and a live chat vendor to assist us with customer service marketing analysis services to help manage our online advertising, customer relationship management services, and internal system monitoring and performance services. These third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality, security and integrity of personal information and to use such information only as directed by us.
  * **Business Transfers** : If we are acquired by or merged with another company, if part or of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the personal information we have collected to the acquiring company or entity. You will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.
  * **In Response to Legal Process**. We may also disclose the information we collect in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
  * **To Protect iContact and Others**. We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or violations of this Policy, our [Terms & Conditions](https://web.archive.org/permission-email-marketing "Terms & Conditions"), our [Anti-Spam Policy](https://web.archive.org/anti-spam-policy "Anti-Spam Policy"), or our [End User Service Agreement](https://web.archive.org/permission-email-marketing#endUser "End User Service Agreement").
  * **Aggregate and De-identified Information**. We may share aggregate, anonymous, or de-identified information, such as Site Data, about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes; however, we do not disclose personal data to such third parties.



## Why Do You Receive Emails?

If you received one or more marketing or promotional e-mails ("commercial e-mails") from us, it means that a) your email address is on our list of customers, trial users or prospective customers; or b) you have provided us your email address so that we could contact you. If you believe you received an email from us in error, please contact us immediately at [abuse@icontact.com](mailto:abuse@icontact.com "abuse@icontact.com").

Our customers may also use iContact's service to send commercial e-mails to users who have opted-in to receive such e-mails. According to iContact's Anti-Spam Policy, our customers are not permitted to send unsolicited marketing or promotional e-mails, and are required to obtain opt-in consent from a recipient, prior to sending a commercial e-mail to the recipient's e-mail address. While we have a strict Anti-Spam Policy, we can not guarantee that our customers will always honor such policy. If you believe you have received an e-mail from one of our customers in error or in violation of our Anti-Spam Policy, please contact us immediately at [abuse@icontact.com](mailto:abuse@icontact.com "abuse@icontact.com").

## What About Public Forums?

Our Site also offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas is visible to and may be read, collected, used or disclosed by other registered Sites users or public visitors to the Site. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, contact us at [customercare@icontact.com](mailto:customercare@icontact.com "customercare@icontact.com").

In addition, even after removal from the Site, certain content may remain in our systems for a period of time, or may be viewable in cached and archived pages of the Site.

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information. We do obtain the customer's consent via email prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial. To request removal of your personal information from our testimonials, contact us at [customercare@icontact.com](mailto:customercare@icontact.com "customercare@icontact.com"). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

## How Do We Secure the Personal Data We Collect?

We use commercially reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of data that we collect or maintain. We also provide each customer with a unique user name and password that must be entered when logging in the customer's account. No data security measures, however, can guarantee 100% security all of the time. While we strive to protect your data from unauthorized use or disclosure, iContact does not warrant or guarantee the security of the data that you provide to us.

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

If you have any questions about security on our site, please email us at [abuse@icontact.com](mailto:abuse@icontact.com "abuse@icontact.com").

## What About Third Party Websites?

The Site contains links to third party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party websites. Customers and visitors who link to other third party websites from the Site should check the privacy and security policy statements of such third party websites to understand the policies and practices of such third party websites as we are not responsible for those policies and practices. Customers and visitors who access a linked site may be disclosing their private information to the owner of such third party websites. It is your responsibility to keep such information private and confidential.

## How Do We Use Cookies & Other Tracking Technologies?

When you interact with the Site, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We may use or engage others to use cookies, clear gifs and Flash LSOs to track user activity and collect Site Data. In addition, we may combine the Site Data we collect with the other data we collect.

**Cookies** : When you come to the Site, our web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. There are two types of cookies: session-based and persistent-based cookies. In addition, we may permit certain third parties to place cookies through our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site, other than by linking persistent cookies to our current customers as defined below.

  * **Session Cookies**. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer. iContact uses session cookies to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to the Site. This allows us to process your online transactions and requests, and to verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
  * **Persistent cookies**. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer. iContact uses persistent cookies that only iContact, or its service providers, can read and use, to identify the fact that you are an iContact customer or prior Site visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
  * **Third Party Cookies**. We may also engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable Site Data. We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of the Site, and to analyze Site usage. We do not share this data with other third parties, except as described above in the section "How We Disclose the Data We Collect." You should note, however, that we do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data.



**Disabling Cookies** : Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in future. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Site visitors who disable their web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be able to browse the Site; however, you must enable cookies in order to use our services.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)** : We or the third parties we engage to track and analyze Site Data may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) to help us better manage content on the Site. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer's hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails. They let us know which emails have been opened by recipients, allowing us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. For information on how to opt-out of receiving marketing e-mails from iContact, or from an iContact customer, please see the section "How to Stop Receiving E-mails" above.

**Flash LSOs** : We may use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your Site preferences, to personalize your visit, or to display content based upon what you view on our Site. Third Parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. We do not have access to or control over these third party cookies nor does this Privacy Policy cover such third parties' use of data.

Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount and type of data stored. In addition, you can not control, delete, or disable the acceptance of Flash cookies through your browser. To learn how to manage your settings for Flash cookies, visit <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118>.

## Termination Policy

Pursuant to Section 22 of the EUSA, at any time, either party may terminate Customer's iContact account for any reason. Customer may request a termination by calling 866-936-5680, Monday through Friday, between the hours of 8:00 a.m. (EST) and 12:00 a.m. (EST).

Amounts paid are not refundable. Subscriptions to our service are pre-paid. As such, any cancellations that occur in the middle of a payment term (month, quarter, or year depending on payment schedule) will be made effective on the final day of such term.

Notwithstanding any termination of this Agreement, Customer will remain obligated to pay iContact Fees which were incurred prior to (and on) the effective date of such termination.

If you use the Services through iContact Free Edition and wish to terminate your account, no action is required. If you use the Services through iContact Free Edition and fail to use the Services for at least sixty (60) consecutive days, as of the sixty-first (61st) day after your last use of the Services your account will automatically expire.

## Credit Card Expirations or Declines

Please note that allowing a credit card to expire or failing to submit payment by check regardless of invoice receipt status will not automatically cancel your account as we maintain all account data, allow subscriptions to occur, and allow you access to your account. You will remain responsible for paying the monthly subscription fee, which will accrue to your account, until we receive a valid termination notice.

We may send notice to the email on record if your credit card is declined. We may also follow-up by phone or mail. We reserve the right to send delinquent accounts to a collection agency if they are not paid within ninety (90) days.

## Retrieving your Data After your Account has been Terminated

Upon any termination of your account, and your payment of all unpaid and outstanding Fees and your written request received by iContact within thirty (30) days of such termination, iContact will provide you with an electronic file of the Customer Recipient Data. You acknowledge that after the thirtieth (30th) day following any such termination, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such Customer Recipient Data without providing you with notice of such deletion. If you use the Services during a Trial Period and fail to convert your account to a standard paid customer account upon the expiration or other termination thereof, iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data after the date of such expiration or termination. If you use the Services through iContact Free Edition and fail to use the Services for at least sixty (60) consecutive days, as of the sixty-first (61st) day after your last use of the Services, you acknowledge that iContact has no obligation to retain the Customer Recipient Data and may delete and destroy such data without providing you with notice of such deletion. Please be sure to export all data you wish to save before terminating your account.
