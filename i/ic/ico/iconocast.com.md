**Site Feedback**  
Under "About Us," we maintain email links to various members of the ICONOCAST organization for feedback on products and services. We collect visitors' contact information (like e-mail address). The customer's contact information is used only to respond to their inquiries. 

**E-mail List**  
If you choose to receive our free weekly e-cast, we ask for an e-mail address you would like ICONOCAST sent to. We only use e-mail addresses to send ICONOCAST. We do not sell or rent out your e-mail address to marketers. In order to provide you with this service, e-mail addresses are shared with Media Synergy Inc.

**Online Surveys**  
Occasionally we send out an online survey via e-mail to random subscribers of the newsletter. Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their e-mail address) and general demographic data (like their gender, geographic location or occupation). We use the results of surveys on an aggregate basis, so that we can improve ICONOCAST. No personal information is shared with third parties. We do not sell or rent out your e-mail address to marketers. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see "Delete/Deactivate" below.

Optionally, visitors to the "Tell Jaco" page on our site can submit timely tips and rumors for potential publication in the "Jacobyte" section of our weekly ICONOCAST e-mail newsletters. In exchange, users are rewarded with gifts supplied by an ICONOCAST marketing partner. For gift mailing purposes only, we collect name, mailing address and phone number. We do not sell or rent out this information to marketers.
