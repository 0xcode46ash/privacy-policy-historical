We have developed a data protection policy, an information security policy and other internal controls to ensure that our uses of customer information comply with the eight Data Protection Principles of good information handling.

The principles require data to be: fairly and lawfully processed; accurate and kept up to date; adequate; relevant and not excessive; kept no longer than necessary; processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects; held securely; and not transferred to countries without adequate protection.

Iceland Foods LTD is committed to ensuring the privacy of your information. We understand that the privacy of your information is very important to you. We are careful about the information we ask you to provide and only use your information to process orders and to provide you with the best shopping experience possible.

We have set out below details of the information we will collect about you, how we ensure the security of your information and how we will use your information.

**What personal information do we collect?**  
We only collect personal information that is knowingly and voluntarily given. Generally, this occurs when you register on the website, change your details, request a service, email us, enter a competition or provide us with feedback.

  * When registering with us, we need to collect the following information:
  * your postcode to find your full address and to establish whether we can deliver to your area;
  * your email address to confirm your order via email. We will also need your email address if you have given us permission to contact you about new features and special offers;
  * your telephone number in the event of a problem with your order or delivery, as we may need to contact you quickly;
  * your credit/debit card number, valid from date, expiry date, and issue number (if applicable) to collect payment for your order. We require only the same information that you would give when paying with your card in a store;
  * a user name and password so we can store your details securely. A user name and password also mean we can recall your information for you each time you log in. 

  
We automatically collect anonymous information each time you visit. The information obtained in this way, which may include purchasing history or browsing patterns, is purely statistical and only used in aggregate form - it cannot be used to identify you. Typical information of this sort may be '40% of our customers buy spaghetti'.

Information in aggregate form is used to:

  * build our understanding of customer habits, interests and requirements; 
  * build marketing profiles; 
  * help with the strategic development of our site and service; 
  * track usage of the site; 
  * measure the success of our service. 

  
**Cookies**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website places on your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to reject them, but you may not be able to take full advantage of our site. Our cookies do not contain or transfer any personally identifiable information about you, but they do enable us to provide enhancing features, such as storing your shopping basket between visits.

**How we store your personal information**  
We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology that provides 128-bit encryption on your information before it is sent to us. This means only our secure server can read your information.

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access or improper use. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you. We have a strict internal policy, which members of staff must comply with as a condition of employment and no external access to the system is permitted. 

**How we use your personal information**  
Personal information is used to: 

  * process orders; 
  * carry out market research; 
  * provide information about the products and services we offer; 
  * deal with queries; 
  * provide the best possible service; 
  * run competitions. 

  
If you do not wish to receive information about our products and services, or about services offered jointly with or on behalf of other organisations, you can decline the opportunity during registration.

**Updating your personal information**  
On the shopping site, you are able to change the details you gave us when registering by clicking on 'my details' and selecting 'Personal profile'. You can change your name, phone number, email address and password. To change your registration address, select 'deliver to another address' when asked to confirm your delivery address during log in, then click 'i've moved' to enter your new address.

**Disclosing information**  
We will not pass your information to any third parties if you have told us not to. We may pass on some general statistical information about our customers, sales figures, traffic patterns and related matters to reputable third parties, but these details will not include any personally identifying information. 

If you have any queries or concerns about the privacy of your information, or how we use your information, please contact our Legal Department at Iceland Foods LTD, Second Avenue, Deeside Industrial Park, Deeside, Flintshire, CH5 2NW (or by telephone on 01244 843610).[](javascript:history.back\(\))
