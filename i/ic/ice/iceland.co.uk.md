 **Web Analytics – What information is collected from your device and how is it used?**  
We use a web analytics service (eVisit Analyst) which compiles data your device automatically offers when you access any website in order to enable that site to function correctly, such as IP (internet protocol) address and browser user agent data (including browser type, operating system and device type). All information is processed anonymously and is not used in any way, or in combination with any other data, to personally identify individuals. The data is stored in the EU by our analytics service provider and is only shared with authorised third parties.

This information is used to create web statistics data to help us build a picture of how our website is used including how many visitors we have, number of return visits, how frequently pages are viewed, what is popular with visitors and where in the world our visitors are located. We use this data to improve the way our website works so we can make sure our visitors can easily find what they are looking for and have a better overall browsing experience when they visit our website.

 **Who is your personal information shared with?**  
We are required to share our information with the police and other law enforcement authorities if required to do so by law or court order for fraud detection and prevention.  We may also disclose personal information as required to enforce and protect our rights under contract and at law.
