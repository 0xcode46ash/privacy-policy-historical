# Icenium Privacy Policy

**Telerik AD**

## Icenium™ Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy describes our privacy practices as they relate to your use of our Icenium service. This Privacy Policy applies only to the information shared and collected by us through your use of Icenium and does not apply to any third party applications, websites, or posts.

## Information We Collect

In order to download and use the Icenium service, users log in to the Icenium developer portal (the “Portal”) with either personalized Google, Facebook or Yahoo account credentials or Telerik account credentials.

  * If you choose to log in to the Portal using your Google, Facebook or Yahoo account, the applicable third party site will share with us certain personally identifiable information (your name, email address, company name, and the country you have specified upon registration) in order to enable us to identify your account. 


  * If you choose to log in to the Portal using your Telerik account, we ask you to provide us with the following information: name, company name, country, phone number and email address. 



In addition, any time you use Icenium, we may collect standard information including account activity (such as cloud storage usage and number of log-ins), your machine’s IP address, date and time of access, and other product related information.  This information is retained in our server logs and used for the operation of Icenium in order to maintain quality of the service and to identify trends and usage statistics.

Icenium Service uses Rackspace Service to store your data (such as your source code and software components) created in Icenium.  This means that if you choose to use Icenium Services, your data will be stored through the Rackspace Service. Your use of this Rackspace service through Icenium is governed by the Privacy Statement, accessible at   http://www.rackspace.com/information/legal/privacystatement/. 

## Information-gathering Tools

**Persistent Cookies**

We use cookies to better serve Icenium users. Cookies are small text files a web site can use to recognize a repeat visitor to the web site. We may use cookies for various reasons. We use persistent cookies that expire after two weeks.  Only Icenium Service has access to these cookies. We will authenticate our Icenium users through an identity provider and assign a unique identifier cookie that is used by Icenium.  We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies and all of the information stored in the cookies is encrypted for additional protection. 

If you do not want us to deploy cookies in your browser, you can set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when a web site tries to put a cookie in your browser software. However, if you choose to disable cookies in your browser, your ability to use Icenium and/or related services may be affected.

## Google Analytics

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., to evaluate your use of the Product, compile reports on activity, and provide other services relating to Internet usage. Google Analytics uses first-party [cookies](http://www.google.com/intl/None/privacy/faq.html#toc-terms-cookie) that store information, such as what time the current visit occurred, whether the visitor has been to the site before, and what site referred the visitor to the web page. Browsers do not share first-party cookies across domains. 

Google classifies Google Analytics data as confidential information, governed by Google's privacy policies. Google’s privacy policy can be viewed at ht[tp://www.google.com/intl/None/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/intl/None/policies/privacy/).

By using Icenium, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above. If you choose, you can opt out by turning off cookies in the preferences settings in your browser, or by downloading and installing Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on at <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>. The add-on communicates with the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js) to indicate that information about the website visit should not be sent to Google Analytics. The Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to the website itself or to other web analytics services. For more information on Google Analytics, please visit <https://www.google.com/analytics/>.

## Use of Your Personal Information

We collect and use your personal information to provide and improve our products and services and to conduct research and development.

We also would like to be able to communicate with you and to keep you up to date on services that may be of interest to you. For this purpose, we may deliver personalized information through newsletters, events, or trainings. In addition, your personal information is essential to providing effective customer support. 

We will not use your personal information for any other purposes, unless we are  required to do so by law. In such case we will notify you as required and permitted by law.

## Sharing Your Personal Information Collected

We do not share any of your personal information with third parties. We may review information gathered from our customers for support purposes. For example, if you require support, we may review and test your data in order to provide you with the appropriate customer service. 

## Information Security

We are committed to protect the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we conduct internal reviews of our data collection, storage, and processing practices and implement physical security and encryption procedures. 

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. 

Access to your personal information is restricted to those Telerik employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to process it and provide personalized customer support to you. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination, if they fail to meet those obligations.

## How to Access and Update Your Personal Information

You can keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up to date by logging in to your icenium.com account and visiting the “Your Account” page. You may also email us at [support@icenium.com](mailto:support@icenium.com) with any requests to update your personal information. 

We will retain your personal information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. We may retain your personal information for a longer period, only if this is required or permitted by law.

You can unsubscribe from marketing communications or you can delete your account entirely. To do so, please email us at [support@icenium.com](mailto:support@icenium.com). 

## Public Forums 

We may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms through Icenium. Any personal information you choose to submit in such a forum may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.  Telerik is not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.

## International Transfer of Information Collected

Since we have a number of offices in different countries and Icenium Services are offered globally, we may transfer and access our customer’s personal information from around the world. This Privacy Policy is applicable if we transfer any customer information to other countries. 

## Changes to the Privacy Statement

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your explicit consent. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
