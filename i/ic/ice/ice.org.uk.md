# Privacy policy - Institution of Civil Engineers

The Institution of Civil Engineers is committed to protecting the privacy of both members and non-members. 

Any personal information captured on ICE websites is protected under the eight data protection principles outlined in the Data Protection Act 1998. These principles safeguard the reasonable and lawful use of personal data without infringing on user privacy. 

Data maintained by ICE will be used confidentially for normal purposes, including subscription collection, mailing of publications, and notification of conferences and events. ICE may also submit relevant data to carefully screened third parties who can offer members and customers useful information and services. Revenue secured from third parties will help ICE improve and enhance its current services.

Overseas members may have their data transferred to International Country representatives for administration of local events in their country of residence. ICE may also use relevant information to target and promote journals, training, and recruitment services. 

If you do not wish to receive such information, please inform the Data Protection Officer in writing or at the email address provided below.

Please note that some employers are not happy for recruitment information to be sent to work email addresses. You may wish to change your default email address to a home or private email address. Please check your employer's email policy.
