**What information does IKEA collect, and how does IKEA use this information?**  
There are two types of information we collect. The first is general information regarding the pages on our website. We keep track of how many people visit certain pages so we can improve the site. The second is specific information you give us if you choose to request printed materials or register for coupons or other promotions. We use this information to fulfill your request and to offer you discounts, and keep you informed of our products and special events.

IKEA uses session cookies to improve the usability of the site. These cookies are anonymous and are not saved on your computer. They are in no way linked to personally identifiable information.

**Does IKEA disclose the information it gathers to third parties?**  
IKEA does not sell, rent or release information gathered on our website to any individuals, companies or groups. Any information we gather is used for IKEA's own purposes as stated above. 

**Will I receive email from IKEA? Can I choose not to?**  
You will only receive email communication from IKEA if you register your email information with us (for example, when you register for a coupon) and choose to be included in future email communications. A check box is always included with every IKEA registration page, so you can choose not to receive emails if you prefer. Any email you receive from us will contain information regarding opportunities that may benefit you, such as sales and coupon offers. 

**How secure are my transactions?**  
IKEA uses secure server software. Should you provide us with sensitive information for any reason (such as a credit card number), that information will be encrypted with industry standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology. Please note that email is not encrypted and is not considered a secure means of transmitting credit card numbers.
