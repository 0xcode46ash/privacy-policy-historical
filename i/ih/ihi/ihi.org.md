#### Privacy Policy

We at the Institute for HealthCare Improvement (IHI), believe that you have the right to know how your personal information may be used or disclosed. You take your privacy seriously, and we respect your concerns. Accordingly, we have created this Privacy Statement in order to describe how we collect information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. Please read it carefully, and if you have any questions or concerns, please send us a comment at [info@ihi.org](mailto:info@ihi.org). Unless otherwise indicated, this Privacy Statement applies only to information collected via the IHI.org website. "Information" means information about you that is personally identifiable such as your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card information, areas of interest data related to your improvement work, and other information about you that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that IHI does not own or control, or to people that IHI does not employ or manage. 

**Gathering of Information**  
We collect data from you ("Information") in different ways and on many different parts of our website including: when you register for IHI.org; when you download or use articles and information; when you comment on content; when you use the search function; when you share your improvement stories, tools and other resources, or even when you are just perusing the site and reading content. 

**Use of Information**  
We may collect Information that you choose to share with us when you register for the website. This Information is only collected with your permission and may be updated or deleted by you at any time. If you choose these options during your registration, we may use your Information to send you a newsletter or email messages with updates and notices concerning new content posted to the site and/or products or services that we think might be of interest to you. Completing the registration information allows us to better understand you, your position, your organization type and interests. If at any time you would like to stop getting this email information you can do so by emailing [info@ihi.org](mailto:info@ihi.org).

When visiting any website, your browser sends information to the site's hosting server identifying the browser you are using, your Internet Service Provider, the page you last visited, and the page you are currently visiting. We log this Information. We may also track and catalog the search terms that you enter in search forms. We make use of a standard feature of browser software called a "cookie" that helps us recognize you when you visit. We store your email address in a cookie file and place the file on the hard drive of your computer. Most browsers accept cookies. However, if you wish, you can usually set your browser to refuse cookies. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, you will need to log in to the site each time you visit. 

**Access to Information**  
IHI.org, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement and its employees have access to your Information. We use all of this Information to administer and improve the operations of IHI.org. Aggregate Information or data on visitors to our site and how the site is being used, including the pages users are viewing, will also be logged. Aggregate data does not identify individuals but rather describes data as a whole. We may also share aggregate Information with market analysts, advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and any other third parties. 

We may allow third party service providers and consultants access to Information on an as-needed basis. We may also share Information as required by law or to cooperate with legal authorities in a criminal investigation. 

**Third Parties/Links**  
IHI.org links to other sites. Please recognize that we cannot control the use or security of your Information once it leaves our hands. If you have any concerns regarding the security or privacy of our affiliates, we encourage you to review their privacy policies or even to contact them directly. IHI.org and the Institute for Healthcare Improvement are not responsible for the privacy practices, data collection, security or content of other websites. We treat any Information we receive from third parties as carefully as the Information you provide to us directly. 

Please remember that when you respond to a classified advertisement by email you are sending information to a third party and not to the Institute for Healthcare Improvement or IHI.org. We cannot control the use or security of any Information that you send to a third party, so please be careful. 

**Extranet Functionality**  
IHI encourages robust information sharing over the extranet between authorized users. If you use the extranet, please remember that other authorized extranet users can view the information you share. You should exercise caution when disclosing any sensitive information. Never give out personal information such as your name, address, phone number or social security number. Never give out information about an organization, a patient or another person if you do not have the express authority or permission to share that information publicly. 

**Security**  
We use industry-standard SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of your personal Information. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the Information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. Please keep your password private. We will never ask for it by phone or email, and neither should anyone else. 

You may wish to delete unknown email attachments before opening them as they can contain destructive viruses. Remember that nothing you write on the Web is completely private â€” including email. 

**Viewing and Updating Your Information**  
You may view and correct your Information by accessing the "My IHI" link on the left hand of the website. Please note that you must log in with your private user name and password to access your Profile. 

By using IHI.org, you consent to the collection and use of your Information as we have outlined in this Privacy Statement and our Terms of Use. If you do not agree to our policy, you may not use IHI.org. We may change our policies at any time and without prior notice. If we decide to change this Privacy Statement, we will post the changes to this page so that users may be aware of our actions. Your continued use of IHI.org following a posting of changes to this Privacy Statement will mean that you accept those changes.
