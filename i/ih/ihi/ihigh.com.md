# iHigh.com's Privacy Policy | The iHigh.com Network

This policy covers how iHigh treats personal information that iHigh collects and receives, including information related to your past use of iHigh products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that iHigh does not own or control, or to people that iHigh does not employ or manage. 

**General Privacy Policy**

  * iHigh collects personal information when you register on the network, when you use iHigh products or services, when you visit iHigh pages or the pages of certain iHigh partners, and when you enter contests and competitions. iHigh may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. 

  * When you register we ask for information such as your name, email address, birth date, gender, and ZIP code. For some financial products, contest prize delivery, and services we might also ask for your address. When you register with iHigh and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. 

  * iHigh automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address and the page you request. 

  * iHigh uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. 

  * iHigh does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 



    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with iHigh under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help iHigh communicate with you about offers from iHigh and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 

  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of iHigh's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

  * We transfer information about you if iHigh is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, iHigh will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

  * iHigh does not provide any personal information to advertisers when you interact with or view an ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet targeting criteria that may be used to display the ad. 

  * We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the iHigh.com service, such as service announcements, and administrative messages, that are considered part of your iHigh account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of receiving them. 



  * You can delete your iHigh account by emailing the site administrator at [peter@ihighteam.com](mailto:peter@ihighteam.com)

  * We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 



  * We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you. 



  * iHigh may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to your iHigh Message Center or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
