# PRIVACY STATEMENT - iheartradio - Listen to 750+ Stations

This policy informs you of Clear Channel's practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information from this Clear Channel Website. This policy applies to information collected on the websites at which the policy is posted. It does not apply to information Clear Channel might obtain about you or from you through other means, including offline or when you send email messages to us. Personal information is information that allows us to contact you (such as email address, home address, or telephone number) or other information that, when linked to your name or contact information, allows us to personalize your visit to our site by providing you with information that suits your interests.

Clear Channel is the owner of this website and retains all ownership rights to the information collected at this site. Clear Channel reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy. Any changes to this Privacy Policy will be posted here, and we encourage you to check back from time to time. 

**Information Collection**  
Although you may use many features of this site without completing a registration or sign-up form, or otherwise providing us with your personal information, visitors who do register and/or sign up for special services may have access to additional features of the site and are more likely to receive information suited to their interests. For example, a registered user is eligible for additional services provided by this website such as listener clubs and personalized content. Our registration and special services sign-up forms may ask you for contact information (like name or email address) and demographic information (like zip code or age). You must provide the information in order to receive the benefits of registration or of the special service. In addition to website registrations, we also allow users to participate in other interactive features where submission of personal information is required. These features include our online surveys and contests, online shopping areas, interactive forums like blogs and chat rooms, and more.

 **Information Use**  
We may use the personal information you give us to respond to your request, to bill you for and deliver to you any products or services you order from us, to better tailor your website experience to your interests, to request your opinions with respect to media and entertainment, and to send you information about Clear Channel and its services as well as promotional material on behalf of some of our partners. We may use information that you provide to us to inform you of content on the web, radio and other methods of content delivery, in which you may be interested and to provide or display the content according to your preferences. We may also use the information as otherwise described to you (including at the time we collect your information), or for our other legitimate business purposes. We will also share this information within the Clear Channel family in order to enhance your experiences with Clear Channel, and those additional Clear Channel companies may use the information for their own purposes as described above. 

**Supplemental Information**   
To enhance Clear Channel's ability to tailor this site to your preferences, we may combine information that you provide us on our websites and otherwise with other information about you that we may obtain. 

**Public Forums**  
This site may make available chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that you disclose in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Information Sharing With Third Parties**  
We share information with third parties for our legitimate business purposes, which include the following circumstances:

  * With third parties who are providing services on our behalf, such as vendors or business partners who are operating features at our website (our online stores or career areas, for example), or vendors who are assisting with product delivery or prize awards. These third parties also include merchant and credit card companies, and by giving our site your credit card and related personal information, you are authorizing our store to give that information to the merchant and credit card company in order to confirm and fulfill your order.
  * From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by Clear Channel to provide additional features at this site. These special relationships may include "powered by" partners, business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). These might include, for example, pages that share our name and that of another entity, such as TicketMaster. You should look for a specific privacy statement on any such co-branded page. Any personal information that you provide when signing up at one of those co-branded pages may be shared with our third party partner. You should also check our partner's website for information regarding its privacy policies.
  * Also, the nature of some features of our site may require that we share personal information about you with persons or companies outside of the Clear Channel family. For example, this may occur at a feature that enables you, via our site, to ask questions of persons or entities that are not part of the Clear Channel family. By responding to those features of the site, whether by email or direct entry of information on our Website, you are consenting to our transferring that information to such persons or entities.
  * With respect to specific registration modules, like contests, we may disclose personal information collected, and we will post a conspicuous statement on the registration module to the effect that we will be disclosing the information collected with third parties.
  * If we believe we are required to do so by law, or to otherwise cooperate with a government or law enforcement request.
  * In the event that all or part of our business, this website, or features or functions offered by this website, is sold to, acquired by, or otherwise transferred to a third party, the personal information collected in connection with that business/website/feature/function will be transferred to the new owner.
  * We may share any of the information collected from you with these other non-Clear Channel companies in an aggregate basis. The aggregated information is not linked to any information that can identify you.
  * In addition, we may share this information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of the Clear Channel family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contact information. 



**Passive Information Gathering Techniques**  
We may use a variety of passive tracking techniques in the operation of this Website. For example, we may collect your IP address to administer our Website, to help diagnose problems with our server, to analyze trends, to track users' webpage movements, to help identify you and your shopping cart, and to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

This Clear Channel site may also use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the site. Cookies reside on your computer and help our website to recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. This information allows us to customize delivery of information. For example, our site may use cookies to save and remember registration information or preferences that you may have set while browsing the site, to keep track of your shopping cart, to ensure you don't see the same ad content repeatedly, to deliver content specific to your interests, and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. We use cookies only to gather information as indicated in this policy. 

In addition, on occasion our site may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires.

 **Advertising (Ad Networks and Banner Ads)**  
We may use an ad network provider to help present advertisements on this and other Clear Channel Websites. This ad network provider, like other advertising service vendors, uses cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on the hard drive of your computer to serve you advertisements tailored to interests you have shown by browsing on this and other sites you have visited, and to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before and to avoid sending you duplicate advertisements. In doing so, the provider collects non-personal data such as your browser type, your operating system, Web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other clickstream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by these ad network providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not ours. If you do not want the benefits of these advertising cookies, you may opt-out by visiting <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>. However, if you do so you may not receive the full benefit from the use of our site.

We license ad-server software from another company to place banner advertising on our sites. All of the data provided and generated by the ad-server software remains in our possession and no data is transferred to the licensor of the software. This feature of our site may, on occasion, set "cookies" on your computer. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is treated in the same manner as other information as described in this statement.
