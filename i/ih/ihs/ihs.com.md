**Privacy Statement for IHS**

Your right to privacy and to protect your personal information is important to IHS. We recognize that when you provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. 

The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices for www.ihs.com, www.ihsengineering.com, www.ihsgroup.com, global.ihs.com, and www.techsavvy.com. This site contains links to other Web sites, but IHS is not responsible for the privacy practices of other Web sites or companies.

**How IHS Gets And Uses Your Information**

Orders \- IHS requires users to provide contact, billing, and shipping information when they place an order. Financial information (like credit card number and expiration date) is required for online purchases. Sales representatives may collect additional information when orders are processed offline. All this information is necessary to fill your order and contact you if there is a problem. Customer information is also used to announce new products, provide support, and maintain relationships.

Registrations And Free Trials - Some Web pages may require or request registration information (like name and e-mail address). This information is used to manage usage, announce changes to the online resources, and provide news related to the resources you are registered to use.

E-Newsletters \- To keep you up to date with the product changes and news offerings, IHS provides many announcement services, including e-mail newsletters. E-newsletters are managed by a subscription model and require you to provide minimal contact information (like name and e-mail address). Your subscription information is used to send out annoucements on a regular basis. You may unsubscribe at any time.

Surveys And Feedback Forms - At times, IHS requests voluntary information to measure effectiveness in serving customers. Your information is used in aggregate to help us make decisions about the services we provide. The information is also used for follow-up responses and to provide news on the subject areas related to the surveys and forms.  


**How You Can Manage Your Information**

Account Management - Where possible, IHS provides you with password-protected access to your account contact information. You can update this information as needed on the Web site where you provided the information.

Unsubscribe \- All e-newsletters and announcements contain unsubscribe instructions. 

Contact Us - If at any time you wish to stop receiving information from IHS, you can e-mail your request to info@ihs.com or write to the address below. Please include your name, company, address, and e-mail address.   


**How IHS Group Will Protect Your Information**

IHS takes appropriate steps to protect your privacy and your information. Sensitive information submitted via this Web site is protected both online and offline. Credit Card information, for example, is protected by SSL encryption and managed by secure third-party applications such as CyberCash. All IHS databases reside behind a firewall, which is the best defense against theft or manipulation of your data. 

IHS does not sell or rent online user information to different companies. IHS considers your information a business asset and will take the appropriate steps to protect it from theft and improper use by others.

IHS Web sites are not targeted towards children under the age of 13. However, we know that children's curiosity could lead them to IHS. None of the content on our Web pages deals with topics of a sexual or inappropriate nature. However, parental guidance and consent are recommended.

**Third Party Services**

IHS contracts with third-party service providers, such as CyberCash, ClickAction, and Engage to manage some online customer services. To provide these services (like order processing, e-newsletter delivery, and content serving) your information is used by these third parties, but does not leave their control and is not sold or rented to other companies in accordance with the permissions you provide.
