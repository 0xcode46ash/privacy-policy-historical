# Privacy Statement for iFriends.net

* **Overview**

The iFriends Network respects and safeguards the privacy of every individual who visits our website. This Privacy Statement is a formal document that outlines the information which may be collected about you while you use the IFriends Network, and how that information may be used. (If you would like to review a plain-spoken presentation of how iFriends protects your privacy, and the practical ways that our policy might affect your life, please click here for our "side bar" article, "How iFriends Protects Your Privacy", or click here for a list of frequently-asked questions and answers concerning iFriends' privacy policies ) This Statement will also instruct you on what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared when you visit the iFriends Network website. 

* **Personally-Identifiable Information**

The iFriends Network will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you (including, but not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, email address, Social Security number, Bank account or credit card information, or any combination of data that could be used to identify you, such as birthdate, zip code, and gender) unless you provide it to us voluntarily.

If you do not want your personally-identifiable information collected, please do not submit it to us. If you have already submitted this information and would like for us to remove it from our records, please contact us at the Web site, listed at the bottom of this Statement. We will use reasonable efforts to delete your information from our existing files.

When you do provide us with personally-identifiable information, such information will be gathered solely by the iFriends Network, and is for use solely by the iFriends Network. At any point where personally-identifiable information is requested, any information that is optional to provide, rather than mandatory, will be clearly marked as such. We may use personally-identifiable information in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process that information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services; and we may use that information to contact you. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. 

The iFriends Network may utilize electronic newsletters to reach all or a subset of all registered users, using the e-mail address collected. Users may remove themselves from such mailing lists at any time by following the instructions found at http://www.ifriends.net/legal/unsubscr.htm or by following the instructions that shall be sent as part of any of such mailings. 

The iFriends Network may request personally-identifiable information on specific pages that allow users to contact the iFriends Network, including the "Sheriff's Office", "Unsubscribe from e-mail", "Cancel my account", "Report Bugs", and "Help" services. In all of the above cases, such information is being collected to assist us in solving a specifc issue addressed by the user and/or to allow us to contact the user with an appropriate response. 

Under no circumstances, unless required to do so by subpoena or court order by an authorized law enforcement agent or appointed Officer of the Court, will the iFriends Network release any personally-identifiable information, in whole or in part, to any third party, without first obtaining the express consent of the individual user. 

* **Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Collected Automatically**

In some cases, information may be collected about you that is not personally-identifiable. iFriends may collect this information directly, or indirectly, through [certain third parties such as DoubleClick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/). Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site. To learn how to prevent iFriends and other parties from using cookies during your visit to iFriends, see "How to prevent iFriends or other parties from writing cookies to your hard drive" and "How to erase cookies from your hard drive" below. 

* **Non-Personally-Identifiable Information Collected Automatically Which Could Theoretically be Linked With Other Databases in the Future**

Internet advertising networks such as [DoubleClick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/) (which is used on this web site) are currently the focus of regulatory and legislative scrutiny concerning the breadth and ultimate use of information collected from websites like iFriends. When you navigate through iFriends, DoubleClick may set cookies during your viewing of certain pages. iFriends utilizes the data which DoubleClick has collected in this fashion to determine how far you have progressed into the iFriends site. (This information is of great value to iFriends as it can be used to determine which advertisements have the greatest likelihood of ultimately leading you to the iFriends Membership Signup page or to other iFriends pages where products or services are sold). 

As you navigate through iFriends, DoubleClick has the opportunity to record the "referring URL" of the page you viewed while the cookie was written. For example, a referring URL such as [_http://apps7.ifriends.net/~wsapi/ifbrowse.dll?room=2 &type=L&filter=n_](http://apps7.ifriends.net/~wsapi/ifbrowse.dll?room=2&type=L&filter=n) contains certain information intended for, and read by, iFriends' web servers, and which is generally understood only by iFriends' programmers and technical staff. For example, "room=2&type=L&filter=n" indicates that the user is viewing a series of videochat rooms which are in the "Psychics/Advice" category (room=2), are displayed in the "list" format (type=L) and which are "filtered" in such a way as no adult-oriented content should appear (filter=n). 

Although iFriends does not provide DoubleClick or any other party with a reference or index that can be used to translate the meaning of these codes, DoubleClick or other third parties have the _technical_ and _theoretical_ capability to build a database dictionary, based upon manual, human labor by substantial numbers of DoubleClick staff who, through an observational trial-and-error scheme, may ultimately be able to independently compile an accurate index of what each iFriends room number relates to, as well as dozens of other variables that at one time or another are visible in the iFriends referral URL. Were such a dictionary ultimately produced, and were it maintained in such a way that every time iFriends altered its internal linking syntax, a human at DoubleClick observed the change and performed a corresponding update in DoubleClick's own dictionary, the information could potentially be associated with useful information about you that DoubleClick has collected from other sources, and which ultimately be added and stored to an online "profile" about you. (To continue the example, such an online profile might record your preference for and interest in psychics/astrology). 

However, since there are thousands of commercial web services using DoubleClick products and services in a manner similar to iFriends, the already complex task of organizing and maintaining "decoding" dictionary databases and reference works related to each website is multipled in complexity by the number of different websites that could conceivably be tracked. Absent such a labor-intensive undertaking, the referral URL information exposed to DoubleClick as you traverse iFriends is unintelligible gibberish. Nevetheless, the computer and internet industries are known to progress at extremely rapid rates, and there is no guarantee that the necessary technology and manpower will not exist in the future to prevent such online "profiles" from ever being compiled. 

iFriends' contract with DoubleClick gives iFriends' ultimate ownership of all collected data, and DoubleClick is not entitled to use it other than for general reporting of aggregate information. Should regulations and laws evolve which impose limitations and restrictions on iFriends' collection and use of such data (beyond the self-imposed limitations iFriends already imposes upon itself, set forth in this privacy policy), iFriends will be pleased to abide by such laws/regulations. 

You can prevent DoubleClick from tracking anything related to your iFriends experience by [clicking here](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy/opt-out.asp?asp_object_1=&). 

* **Information That May Be Placed Automatically On Your Computer's Hard Drive**

When you view one of our websites, we, [or certain third parties such as DoubleClick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/), may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and will help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to tailor web pages to better match your interests and preferences. iFriends also utilizes services provided by [certain third parties such as DoubleClick.net](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/) which enable iFriends to determine which advertisements are most likely to lead to a certain event or outcome, such as a purchase transaction. Such cookies also can be used to present advertisements to you which you may have not seen before or to present advertisements to you which your browser is known to be capable of displaying, such as "rich media" advertisements (advertisements with sound, video, etc). With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies, or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions.

  1. **How to erase cookies from your hard drive**  
**Netscape Navigator/Communciator**  
Windows users: Make sure that Netscape is not running. Using the "My Computer" or "Windows Explorer", browse to "Program Files", then "Netscape", then "Users", then your current user profile folder (often "default"). Within this folder, locate the file called "cookies" or "cookies.txt". Right-click on this file and select "Delete". 

Mac users: Make sure that Netscape is not running. Go to your Mac System Folder, open Preferences, and open "Netscape Users". Locate the "Magic Cookie" file, drag it to the Trash, then empty the trash. Once you restart Navigator or Communicator, your cookies will be gone.

Unix users: Make sure that Netscape is not running. Simply delete the "cookies" file in your ".netscape" directory. 

**Microsoft Internet Explorer**  
Windows users: Make sure that Internet Explorer is not running. Using the "My Computer" or "Windows Explorer", browse to the Windows folder. If you are using Windows 3.1 or Windows 95/98 without user profiles enabled, double-click the "Cookies" folder. If you are using Windows 95 with user profiles enabled or Windows NT, double-click the "Profiles" folder, double-click the folder with the same name as the name you use to log on to Windows, then double-click the Cookies folder. Locate the _username_ @ _site_.txt file ( _username_ is the name you use to log on to Windows and _site_ is the name of the site whose cookie you wish to delete). Click the cookie file, then click Delete on the File menu. If you wish to delete ALL cookies, just delete all the file that follow that are named _username_ @ _site_.txt.   


Mac users: The instructions for deleting cookies depend on which version of MSIE you are using. For MSIE 2.x, simply delete the System Folder:Preferences:Explorer:Cookies.txt file. For MSIE 3.0, Delte the System Folder:Preferences:Internet Preferences file (however, this may affect other Internet-based applications, so do not delete this file unless you have written down all of the settings your others applications may need). For MSIE 3.01a, on the Edit menu, click Preferences, then, under "Receiving Files" click Cookies, then the cookies you wish to delete, click delete, and click OK. For MSIE 4.x, on the Edit menu, click Preferences, then cookies, click the cookies you wish to delete, click delete, then OK.   


Unix users: Go to your home directory, then change to the .microsoft directory within. Change to the Cookies directory inside. Delete all .txt files within this directory ( _username_ @ _site_.txt). 

  2. **How to prevent iFriends or other parties from writing cookies to your hard drive**  
**Netscape Navigator/Communicator**  
From within the Netscape application, click the " _E_ dit" pull-down menu and click "Pr _e_ ferences...". When the Preferences window appears, click "Advanced". Click "Disable Cookies", then click OK. This will prevent your browser from accepting any site's cookies. 

**Microsoft Inernet Explorer**  
From within the Internet Explorer application, click the " _T_ ools" pull-down menu and click "Internet _O_ ptions...". When the Internet Options window appears, click the "Security" tab. Then, click the " _C_ ustom Level...". Scroll down the Settings options until you get to the Cookies section. Set both "Allow..." options under cookies to "Disable". Click "OK", and "OK" again. This will prevent your browser from accepting any site's cookies. 



* **Public Forums**

This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

* **Minors**

Because iFriends is an e-commerce-driven web-conferencing platform, the company's services are directed to adults who possess validated credit-card information, and are never marketed to individuals under the age of 18. iFriends' tens of thousands of registered "video chathosts" host chatrooms under a potentially infinite number of different categories, ranging from how/to instruction to adult-oriented topics. 

Certain portions of iFriends which may contain content considered offensive to some, are inaccessible to individuals under the age of 18 via a standard "credit-card" wall, as advocated by the Communications Decency Act. For those portions which may be accessible to individuals under the age of 18, such as the iFriends home page and other areas presenting non-offensive content, iFriends has no intention of collecting any personally-identifable information (that is, name, address, telephone number, or email address) from individuals under eighteen years of age. Where appropriate, the iFriends Network will specifically instruct minors not to submit such information on our websites or advertisements. If a minor has provided us with personally-identifiable information, a parent or guardian of that minor should contact us at the email address or phone number listed at the bottom of this Statement if they would like this information deleted from our records. We will use reasonable efforts to delete the minor's information from our existing files. 

* **Who to Contact**

If you have submitted personally-identifiable information through the iFriends Network website and would like that information deleted from our records, please contact our customer service desk at the e-mail address of [help@ifriends.net](mailto:help@ifriends.net) and provide us with your name, your iFriends Network screenname, and any information you feel important. We will use reasonable efforts to delete this information from our existing files.
