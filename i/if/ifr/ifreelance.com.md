# iFreelance.com: Freelance Marketplace - Help: Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. Please read this Privacy Policy to learn about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. iFreelance does not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes without your explicit consent. In the unlikely event that we choose to do so in the future with trustworthy third parties, you will be notified by email, 30 days in advance, and given the opportunity to tell us not to share your personal information with those third parties. 

In addition, as we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell assets. In such transactions, user and customer information is generally one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that EliteTech, Inc. d/b/a iFreelance or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

All registered users of the iFreelance website clicking the "I AGREE" checkbox on the User Registration form agree to the IFreelance Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

**1.        ****INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

The iFreelance website is a Web-based marketplace that directly connects buyers with service providers (collectively "registered users"). iFreelance is the sole owner of the information collected on this website. IFreelance will provide the personal identifying information of registered users to other registered users, with the identified registered user's consent, in connection with facilitating a possible working relationship between registered users. 

Service providers on the iFreelance website agree that some profile information is made accessible to buyers who conduct searches of the iFreelance database. This information includes, but is not limited to, compensation, work availability, region, and self-evaluation.

**2.        ****SECURITY**

iFreelance takes every precaution to protect registered user information. When you submit or view sensitive information via our website, your information is protected, both online and offline. All financial transactions and otherwise sensitive information is protected using very strong encryption levels. In addition, any sensitive information that is stored in our database is heavily encrypted and is secured in a highly supervised environment. We employ many different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized access by users inside and outside the company. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

**3.        ****SERVER LOGS**

iFreelance may log IP addresses for system administration purposes. This information is used to diagnose server problems, monitor traffic patterns, analyze trends, administer the website, track member user patterns, and identify the most popular areas of the website to deliver content most relevant to registered members. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information and are only used to gather broad demographic information for aggregate use, except in the case of fraud. 

**4.        ****EXTERNAL LINKS**

The iFreelance website contains links to other websites and is not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. iFreelance encourages its members to read the privacy policies of all websites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by IFreelance.
