We take seriously the collection of personally identifiable information from our visitors and work to protect each visitor's privacy in accordance with the terms of this policy. We use the terms "visitors" and "you" to include any person who accesses this website for any amount of time. Please carefully review our privacy practices below. 

**I. How To Reach Us**

This website is owned and operated by the Independent Film Channel LLC (referred to herein as "IFC," "We," "Us," or "Our"), a subsidiary of Rainbow Media Holdings, LLC ("Rainbow"). You may contact us directly if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy. Please contact us at [webmaster@ifc.com](mailto:webmaster@ifc.com).

**II. Collection of Personal Information by IFC**

We provide various informative, educational, and/or entertaining features as part of this website. To operate these features and allow website interaction or participation, we may request and collect certain personally identifiable information from our visitors, including, but not limited to, name, home and email addresses, telephone numbers and birth date (referred to herein as "personal information"). For example, to participate in contests, we may ask you to complete an online entry form that requires the submission of your personal information. We use the personal information on the entry form for contest registration, to contact the winners of the contest or as otherwise described below.

We may use collected personal information to allow site membership or online subscription submissions; distribute our newsletter; respond to visitor inquiries or requests; improve our services, including our website; allow participation in public or interactive areas; protect the security of our visitors, system and/or website; for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program or website services; and to survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing, information or other entertainment preferences and how we can improve our programming and website.

We use contract and/or third party service providers to collect visitor personal information over our website on our behalf. These providers disclose personal information to us and/or may assist us with the features provided above.

The personal information collected through this website may be combined and maintained with information we collect offline.

**III. Collection of Personal Information by Site Partners or Co-Sponsors**

Certain third parties may join with us to offer website activities, features or promotions, such as contests or special events. For joint website activities, the co-sponsor or partner of the activity may request and collect your personal information. If you submit personal information in joint activities, the co-sponsor or partner may share personal information submitted for the activity with us and/or we may share such information with them. The co-sponsor or partner may also maintain separate privacy policies governing the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information. IFC and/or the third party partner or co-sponsor may also use the personal information collected in conjunction with such activities for the marketing of additional services, promotions or events. Depending on the activity, visitors will be able to either grant approval on the types of additional offers or services they want to receive before personal information is collected ("opt-in"), or choose to deny use of their personal information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). 

IFC, its parents, affiliates and subsidiaries are not responsible for the collection, use and disclosure practices of third parties.

**IV. Collection of Non-Personal Information and Use of Tracking Devices**

We may collect non-personal information about visitors through use of cookies or other tracking devices, such as gifs.

**Cookies.** A cookie is a small data file that contains a unique identification number that a website places on your hard drive. The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site and selections chosen.

**Gifs.** A clear gif [Graphics Interchange Format] (also known as pixel tags, web beacons or web bugs) is a tiny line of code only 1 by 1 pixel in size that is programmed to collect certain information about a visit to a particular website, such as how many hits a site link receives or to retrieve certain cookies or track visitor preferences. 




These and other tracking devices collect aggregate "hits" data, including Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, clickstream information, the web page from which a visitor enters our site, web pages visited, and duration of visit and domain type. This aggregate information may also include demographic or geographic data and visitor usage patterns.

We may use these devices and information gathered to gauge the effectiveness of our website and site features; to tailor our website to your specific interests, requests or participation; to simplify site navigation; or to deliver a more personalized website service by recognizing certain choices you have made on our site so you do not need to re-enter these choices when you return to our site. For example, we may use cookies to simplify access to member-only features or to track contest entries. We may also use tracking devices to conduct research, for auditing purposes, or to estimate our audience size.

We do not use tracking devices to independently collect personal information. However, the aggregate "hits" data collected by these tracking devices may electronically link to some personal information that you have voluntarily provided over our website. We do not disclose this combined information (personal information linked to our cookie and gif collection practices) to nonaffiliated third parties.

To prevent the automatic recording of data by cookies, you can configure your browser to either reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent. You do not need to have cookies turned on to browse most of our website. You may find, however, that some areas on the website will be slower, may not function at all, and/or you may not be able to participate in activities on our website that require you to log-in or register.

**V. Collections by Advertisers**

We may permit advertising on our website by third parties and/or link to the websites of third parties that are not owned or operated by IFC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries or that do not participate in joint activities with us. These third parties may independently solicit and collect personal information, send their own cookies to our visitors, or link visitors away from our site. They may also use collected data differently than IFC. Please be advised that when you click on an advertisement or link to or visit another website you will be subject to the privacy policy and [terms of usage agreement](https://web.archive.org/ifc/article/bottom/0,,AID-2-CLR-white-BCLR-FFFFFF-,00.html) of that advertiser/website operator. Programs or other applications on your computer may cause advertisements not affiliated with our website to appear on top of our webpages. IFC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries will not be responsible for advertiser ads, links and/or "pop-ups" or the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of other third party advertisers.

**VI. Disclosure of Personal Information by IFC**

We may disclose your personal information with other parties when you consent to the disclosure; it is required or permitted by law; it is necessary to operate our website or our website services; to protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property; to investigate or help prevent unlawful activity or activity that threatens our network or website; to provide or enhance our website features or operations; to enable participation in contests or sweepstakes; to allow receipt of membership or newsletter information; or when disclosure is consistent with IFC's practices for services that are similarly provided offline, such as magazine or program subscription services.

The third parties with whom we disclose personal information include our parents, affiliates or subsidiaries; website sponsors or partners; agents; consultants; content or service providers, including fulfillment services and maintenance and technical service providers; entities that provide website operational support; attorneys; accountants; auditors; authorized government entities or other lawfully authorized parties. We may disclose personal information with other third parties in conjunction with entering into an agreement for the sale of our stock or assets or if we are involved in bankruptcy proceedings.

IFC uses third party service providers to fulfill newsletter requests. If a visitor submits a newsletter request online, IFC and/or the service provider may collect the personal information in the request and we may share such information with each other to process and deliver the newsletter. Our service providers may also combine personal information gathered from online subscriptions with information gathered offline for similar subscriptions. IFC may also disclose personal information to providers that perform other services on its behalf, such as for sending membership or promotional emails.

IFC may further disclose the names of visitors on its website for certain events, such as the winners of contests. If possible, IFC will either notify visitors of this possibility when personal information is collected online or when the information is posted. 

We may disclose aggregate, non-personal information to other parties for other purposes, such as marketing or promotional activities.

**VII. Content of Electronic Communications**

When visitors send an email or other electronic information to us, we will protect the privacy of the visitor's email address and other personal information consistent with this policy. However, we may disclose the content or portion of the email or electronic message that does not contain personal information to other third parties not identified in this policy.

**VIII. Message Boards and Chats (e.g., IFC Rants)**

Please remember that message boards and chat rooms are public areas on our website and any information posted in these areas can be viewed by other visitors or Internet users. Thus, you should not post personal information in these areas. Visitors using message boards or chat rooms must also follow our Interactive Area Code of Conduct. See our [Terms of Usage Agreement.](https://web.archive.org/ifc/article/bottom/0,,AID-2-CLR-white-BCLR-FFFFFF-,00.html)

**IX. How to Discontinue Online Memberships or Registrations**

Online membership, newsletter and schedule features are voluntary offerings. If at any time you choose to discontinue receipt of such electronic communications, please follow the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions contained in the applicable email or electronic communication or go to the "Subscribe/Unsubscribe" area of our website. We will take reasonable efforts to efficiently process your request.

**X. How to Change Personal Information**

You may request that we change or delete certain personal information that we collect about you by contacting us via email at [webmaster@ifc.com](mailto:webmaster@ifc.com). Certain information that we collect cannot be deleted for security purposes, in accordance with various laws or per our business retention practices. We retain the right to refuse to change or delete certain personal information.

**XI. Retention of Personal Information**

We retain personal information for as long as it is needed to maintain our business records in the ordinary course, preserve our database and website records, to comply with laws governing our business, or if there are authorized requests for retention and/or disclosure from government, law enforcement or the courts. This means that we may retain personal information for years after the initial collection of the information.

**XII. Security of the Personal Information We Collect**

We use reasonable commercial efforts to protect the security of personal information transmitted to us through our website and stored by us. We require our employees to protect the privacy of visitors' personal information. Only employees and contractors/vendors with specific authorization have access to our databases containing visitors' personal information.

Please remember that despite our security measures, the transmission of data over the Internet and our storage of data are not guaranteed to be completely secure. Parties not under the control of IFC, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may intercept or access electronic transmissions or other data without authorization. Thus, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of information you send to or receive from us. Any electronic transmissions that you submit or accept are at your own risk.

**XIII. Changes to Our Privacy Policy**

If we update or change the terms of this Policy, we will post changes in a revised Privacy Policy available on this website. To keep informed about the information we collect, how we use it and our disclosures, you must review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.

**XIV. Children's Privacy Policy**

We do not target this website to children under the age of thirteen and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen. If upon notification by a parent or guardian, or discovery by other means, that a child under thirteen has improperly registered on our website, we will immediately cancel the child's membership and/or participation and delete the child's personal information from our records.

If we decide to request information from children, we will require verifiable parental consent before we collect any personal information from children under thirteen years of age, except in circumstances allowed by law.
