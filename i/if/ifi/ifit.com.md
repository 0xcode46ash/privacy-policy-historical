# iFit® :: Privacy Policy » iFit Live

**iFit.com respects your privacy. We have established this policy to define when we collect personally identifiable information from visitors to iFit.com and what we do with such information.**

### Privacy

Privacy refers to information that we at ICON Health & Fitness, Inc. ("ICON"), owner of this site, gather about you and the use that we make of it in the course of our business.

ICON collects personally identifying information only during contests, sweepstakes and site membership registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the site in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. ICON may use such information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event ICON plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and can decline from having such information posted.

Information submitted at the time of any form of registration may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by ICON. ICON does not share this information with other companies. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use at any time by written request.

### Registration

When you register with iFit.com, we ask for your email address, age, gender, weight, height, and personal goals and interests. When you use a credit card to pay for any of iFit.com's services or products, we ask for your name, address, credit card and credit card-related information. Once you give us your name and address -- and log on to our services -- you are not anonymous to us. 

iFit.com automatically receives and records information in our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the page(s) you request.

iFit.com may use information in three general ways: to respond to your requests for information, services and products; to contact with reports about your personalized services and about special offers; and, to customize both the content and advertising you see on iFit.com pages.

### Use of Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites. Cookies help make this site better by showing how and when guests use the site. They do not, however, gather user specific information about persons who use the site. Many content updates and improvements are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This statistical information is most easily tracked with cookies. This information is not shared with any third parties whatsoever. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is possible that some areas of this site will not function properly if you do so.

### Editing Your Personal Information and Preferences

iFit.com allows you to edit your personal profile and preferences at any time.

### Security

Your iFit.com personal profile information is password-protected for your privacy and security.

iFit.com may use industry-standard SSL-encryption to protect certain data transmissions.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

iFit.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy. If we make a substantial change, we will post a prominent notification on iFit.com web pages. You can send mail with any further questions to us at:
