We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the IFILM Network, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We may partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Sale or Transfer**

IFILM reserves the right at its sole discretion to sell, trade or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration or contest submission. This information is used to better understand visitors' use of the IFILM Network, to support related transactions made on the site, and to better know our visitors and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions, or other notifications to them. Additionally, such data, both in an individual as well as in an aggregate form, may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses in the future. Each email newsletter always contains instructions on how to discontinue receipt of the newsletter. However, if a visitor at anytime chooses to no longer receive such information and opt-out from any future mailings, they should simply reply to IFILM's removal instructions and request to be removed from any such list and/or mailings, or they may also send such a request to [feedback@ifilm.com](mailto:feedback@ifilm.com). 

**_How can I talk back to IFILM?_**

**Opting Out; Removing and Modifying Information Provided to IFILM**

After gathering any user information, IFILM offers users the opportunity to remove their user-identifiable information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to no longer interact with the IFILM Network until they later chose to. IFILM additionally provides users the opportunity to update and modify any information they have previously provided by viewing their information sent directly to them following such a request from feedback@ifilm.com, or by U.S. Mail to IFILM Corp., Attn: Privacy Administrator, 1024 N.

**_Some final notes_**

**Third Party Links**

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, IFILM may choose various third party web sites to link to from, and frame within, its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with IFILM, IFILM has no control over these linked sites and each site will have its own, independent privacy and data collection practices. IFILM has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, IFILM seeks to protect the integrity of the IFILM Network and the links placed upon it and therefore requests any feedback on not only its own site, but for sites it links to as well (including if a specific link does not work) to [feedback@ifilm.com](mailto:feedback@ifilm.com). 

**IFILM's special note to parents**

IFILM realizes that many children will visit IFILM Network on the Internet, and IFILM therefore encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children, to participate in the interactive activities offered online, and for children to consult with their parents before submitting any information to any web site, including the IFILM Network. No information should be submitted to or posted on the IFILM Network by guests under 18 years of age without the consent and supervision of their parent or guardian. Although guests under 18 years of age may be allowed, with their parent permission and supervision, to participate in noted contests, if such a guest wins, notification and prizes are sent to the parents or guardian. However, IFILM believes that it is ultimately the parents' responsibility to supervise their children's online activities and consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a kid-friendly online environment. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing their name, address, and other personal information online without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the [Direct Marketing Association home page](http://www.the-dma.org/).

**Terms of Service**

Please also visit IFILM's terms of use establishing the use, disclaimers, and limitations of liability governing the use of the entire IFILM Network. 

**_Your consent_**

By using the IFILM Network, you consent to the collection and use of this information by IFILM. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
