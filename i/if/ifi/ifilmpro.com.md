PRIVACY POLICY

IFILM Corp. ("IFILM") respects the privacy rights of visitors to the website [www.ifilm.com](http://www.ifilm.com/) ("Website"), and we have prepared this "Privacy Policy" so that you will know just how and when we collect "personal information", and how we use personal information. "Personal information" is information that can specifically identify you such as your name, phone number and email address. By using the Website, you acknowledge that you have accepted the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy and User Agreement for the Website as to IFILM's processing of information (including personal information) which you provide to IFILM. 

**_Information Collected on the Website_**

In order to use certain portions of the Website, we may ask that you become a registered Website user by providing certain personal information such as your email address, year of birth and zip code, as well as creating a user name and password. This information will help us properly identify you as a registered user, enable us to customize the Website for your use, and provide faster more efficient customer service. 

We may also ask Website "visitors" (which includes registered and non-registered Website users) to voluntarily provide additional information, including personal information, such as phone and fax numbers, gender, date of birth, income level, occupation, demographic information, and personal consumer preferences. These requests will be marked "optional" (or the equivalent), and we hope that you will participate as your responses help us better know and support our customers. For example, by learning about your needs and interests, we may be able to better tailor specific features, promotions and other notifications within the Website user community. We may also use your registration information and other information you provide to us to create aggregate and anonymous data (in other words, aggregate or statistical information about groups of users, which cannot be used to identify a particular individual). We may use this aggregate and anonymous data for marketing or share it with our sponsors, business associates, or other affiliated companies. Rest assured that we only share your specific personal information with third parties with your prior authorization or as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

IFILM may offer various newsletters to inform Website users about changes or postings to the Website, as well as promotions or special offerings by IFILM or third parties posted on or offered through the Website. When registering as a Website user, you may identify whether you would like to receive these newsletters. If you change your mind at any time, just let us know by following the directions listed below under " ** _Contacting IFILM_** ". 

**_Contests and Promotional Events_**

On occasion, we may make certain contests, sweepstakes or other promotional features and events ("promotional events") available to Website users and we may request that participating users provide additional personal information. This information may be used to administer the promotional events and notify winners, as well as to create and use aggregate and anonymous data. If a promotional event is offered or sponsored by, or co-branded with, a third party, you agree that by participating in such events you authorize IFILM to share that personal information which you have already provided to IFILM with the participating third party. You further acknowledge that IFILM has no control over how these third parties use your personal information and that they may use it for direct marketing. We therefore recommend that you review the privacy policies of these third parties before participating in a promotional event and, if you do not want IFILM to share your personal information with a third party as set forth in this paragraph, you may "opt out" by not participating in the promotional event.
