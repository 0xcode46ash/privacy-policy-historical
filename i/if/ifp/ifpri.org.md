# Privacy Policy | IFPRI

This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. This privacy policy applies to all [IFPRI.ORG](http://ifpri.org/) and [IFPRI.INFO](http://ifpri.info/) websites.

**Personal information**

If you register for an email newsletter, order a print publication or data set, post to a blog or join a discussion group, you may be asked for information that helps to identify you, such as your name, email address, and organization. The information you are asked to provide is used for technical and customer administration of the site only and is not shared with third parties.

**Non-personally identifiable information**

In general, you can browse the IFPRI sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. The only information we gather during general browsing is from standard server logs. These include your IP (Internet Protocol) address, domain name, browser type, operating system, and information such as the web site that referred you to us, the files you download, the pages you visit, and the dates/times of those visits. These will not specifically identify you. The information will be used internally only for Web site traffic analysis. The purpose of this data collection is so that IFPRI can better understand the preferences of its visitors and improve its site and services. This information is never connected with any personal information you supply to us if you register on our website.

If you have any questions or concerns about the Privacy Policy, please contact us at [IFPRI-Webmaster@cgiar.org](mailto:ifpri-webmaster@cgiar.org?subject=Privacy%20Policy).
