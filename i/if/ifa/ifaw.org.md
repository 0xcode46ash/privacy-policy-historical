**Privacy Statement for www.ifaw.org**

The International Fund for Animal Welfare has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: www.ifaw.org. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.

IFAW processes it's donations through a third party service operated by Campaign Solutions of Alexandria, VA. This relationship is 100% confidential and secure. After a completed donation is accepted by Campaign Solutions' server and authorized, the credit card information is destroyed and a finalized report is sent through to IFAW. No information other than to diagnose problems with the transaction server is retained by Campaign Solutions. Campaign Solutions does not resell, retransmit, or retain any information about transactions or personal contact information for donors it processes on behalf of IFAW. 

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary.

Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. This credit card information is destroyed after a final authorization is received by IFAW's transaction processing company.

Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like their email address). We use contact data from our surveys to send the user information about our company.
