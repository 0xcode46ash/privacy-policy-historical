# Privacy policy | IFAW - International Fund for Animal Welfare

We (the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW1)) have created this Policy in order to demonstrate our commitment to preserving your privacy and safeguarding any personal details you provide to us, whether on this website or by another means. This Policy explains how we collect and use your information.

**By using our website or providing us with your personal information you are agreeing to this Policy. We may update this Policy from time to time without notice to you, so please check it regularly.**

**1\. When will I need to provide my details?**

We may collect personal information (for example your name, address, date of birth, e-mail address and telephone number) from you when you:

(a) Make a donation to us,

(b) Complete an online registration or other online form;

(c) Subscribe to our newsletters, updates or Action Alerts;

(d) Participate in our advocacy campaigns;

(e) Request information about IFAW, including our programmes and campaigns;

(f) Respond to our mailings, contests or prize-draws;

(g) Contact us or become involved with us in another way.

As part of these interactions, we may also collect additional information such as your IFAW supporter number, bank or credit card details, gift aid eligibility and information about your interests.

We may also collect information (such as your telephone number and date of birth) from the public domain, either directly or from third parties.

Except where permitted by law, we will never collect sensitive personal data about you without your consent.

**2\. Why do you need my details and how do you use them?**

There are different reasons why we might need your personal details – the main ones are to process your donation, to send you information that you have requested from us, to inform us about the interests and concerns of our supporters and general site visitors concerning IFAW's mission, to keep records of our contact with you, and so that we can better meet your needs.

We may also use your personal details for planning, analysis, and other operational purposes such as supporter profiling. Where we hold your date of birth, we may use this information to inform our legacy programme.

We may also use your details to get in contact with you by post, telephone or e-mail, to keep you up to date on the work of IFAW and the ways in which you can help us in our efforts to raise vital funds.

We also use IP addresses to help us analyse trends, administer the site, track users’ movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

When dealing with your personal information we will at all times comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 (“the Act”), and any other applicable legislation.

**3\. Do you pass my details to any other organisations or individuals?**

We will not sell your personal information, and we will not pass your personal information to any third parties except in the circumstances set out in this Policy.

If you have agreed, we may share your name and address with other charities and not-for-profit organisations so that they can contact you by post for marketing purposes. This enables you to be kept informed of other interesting charitable work that you may wish to support and helps IFAW to spread its message. You can withdraw your consent for us to share your details in this way at any time by following the instructions contained in section 9 of this Policy.

We may allow our staff, consultants, or other providers acting on our behalf to access and use your personal information for the purposes for which you have provided it to us. If we do this, we will not give those individuals/organisations any rights to use your personal information (or to contact you) except in accordance with our instructions.

We may share or disclose your personal information if we are required to do so by any law or court order.

**4\. How is my donation processed?**

Online donations are securely processed by our PCI (Payment Card Industry) compliant payment service providers. Your payment details are collected in an encrypted form (SSL Protocol). Any offline donations that you make by cheque, monthly debit or credit card are securely processed either by IFAW or our PCI compliant trusted service providers. Any credit card details provided to IFAW over the phone are retained only for as long as it takes to securely process your payment, at which point all but the last 4 digits of your card number are redacted from our records.

**5\. Free Will Service**

When you sign up to receive a Free Wills Information Pack, including on the “Your caring for animals lives on” page of our website, your name and address will be passed to the National Free Wills Network so that they can send you the requested information.

There is no obligation to leave a gift in your Will to IFAW as part of the Free Will Service. Your Will remains confidential and we will not receive a copy, but the National Free Wills Network will let us know if you have left a gift to us so that we can inform our legacy team and send you a thank you letter.

Please contact Leanne Beaton by calling 0207 587 6736 or sending an email to [lbeaton@ifaw.org](mailto:lbeaton@ifaw.org) if you would like any further information on the Service or on how your details will be used.

**6\. How do you keep my information secure?**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. This includes a firewall and 24-hour monitoring of site activities by our hosting service provider as well as 256-bit SSL encryption (where permitted by law) on all transaction oriented operations between you and IFAW via our transaction service provider.

While we use SSL encryption to protect personal information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line.

We make no representations about any other websites, and when you access any other website through a link on our website (including social media sites) you understand that it is independent from us and that we have no control over that website or the way your personal information is collected through those websites. Those websites may have their own privacy policies and we encourage you to look at those policies or contact the website operators directly to understand how your personal information is used.

**7\. Where is my information stored?**

The data that we collect from you will be transferred to, and stored at, our US headquarters2. The data may also be processed by staff of other IFAW entities operating outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”)3 or by one of our suppliers/vendors. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing.

**8\. How do you use cookies on the website?**

Our website uses cookies. A "cookie" is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. These cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website, which helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.
