## **INFORMATION SHARING**

Information about our members, customers, and visitors to our website is critical to IFT’s operations. We are not in the business of selling this information to others. This type of information is shared only as described below, and with subsidiaries which IFT controls that are either subject to this privacy policy or follow practices at least as protective as those described in this privacy policy.

  * Protection of IFT and Others: We release account and other personal information when we believe its release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our IFT Community Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IFT, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from members, customers, or visitors for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this privacy policy. 
  * IFT Annual Meeting & Food Expo:  We  periodically share basic attendee data on a one-time-only usage basis with exhibitors of the IFT Food Expo, for the purposes of exhibit-related promotion. Only mailing information is shared, and only data from that particular year’s event is made available to exhibitors at that event.  For the protection of attendees, email addresses are not shared with exhibitors. 
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share that information.
