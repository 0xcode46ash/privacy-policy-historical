Our websites are not currently set up to respond to browser do-not-track signals, but you can configure your browser settings to reject all cookies or prompt you before a cookie is set.

## Disclosure of Personal Information

We may disclose Personal Information as follows:

## Business Transitions

In the event iFunny Inc goes through a business transition, including, but not limited to, a merger, acquisition, partnership, business reorganization, debt finance or sale of company assets, or in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, we may use Personal Information as part of the context of any such business transition. In most instances, Personal Information will be part of the assets transferred. Additionally, we may share Personal Information with our partners, affiliates, contractors, and service providers, as necessary, to provide iFunny Services to you or to otherwise improve our services.

## Legal Disclaimer

Though we make commercially reasonable efforts to preserve user privacy, iFunny will not disclose Personal Information to third parties except in response to a duly authorized subpoena, court order, or search warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction over iFunny or in response to a valid emergency request. iFunny will evaluate emergency disclosure requests consistent with the law (including 18 U.S.C. § 2702(b)(8)) on a case by case basis. If, after reviewing an emergency disclosure request, iFunny has a good faith believe that there are exigent emergency circumstances that involve the danger of death or serious physical injury to a person, iFunny may disclose Personal Information necessary to prevent that harm.

iFunny may notify its users of third party requests for their Personal Information, including, but not limited to, by providing its users with a copy of the request, unless it is explicitly prohibited from doing so by valid legal process, such as a court order. Where prior notice is prohibited, iFunny may notify its users that a third party has requested their Personal Information after Personal Information has been disclosed.

## Safety and Protecting Our Interests

We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you in order to prevent damage to our tangible and/or intangible property, for safety reasons, in the course of collecting amounts owed to us, or for other similar reasons as we see fit in our discretion.
