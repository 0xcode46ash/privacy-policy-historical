Immigration Direct (the "Corporation," "we" or "us"), respects the privacy concerns of each visitor (a "Visitor," "you" or "your") to its website www.immigrationdirect.com (the "Website") and has created this Privacy Policy to explain the type of information gathered from the Visitor's visit to and use of the Website and its services, and how such information may be used.

As a general policy, no "Personally Identifiable Information" (as defined below) is automatically collected from the Visitor's visit to the Website. However, certain non-personal information, including the type of browser being used, its operating system and the Visitor's IP address, may be recorded by the standard operation of the Website's internet servers. This information can be used to help diagnose server problems, administer the Website and generally enhance the Visitor's online experience.

Personally Identifiable Information includes, without limitation: (i) contact data (such as a Visitor's first and last name, physical street address, city, state, zip code, phone number and e-mail address), (ii) financial data (such as a Visitor's credit card number, expiration date, and verification code), (iii) demographic data (such as a Visitor's zip code and gender), and (iv) other legal data (such as a Visitor's social security number and other sensitive information necessary to complete and generate the proper documents).

Corporation will collect and use Personally Identifiable Information about you to respond to your request for products or services offered through the Website. Corporation will also collect this information in order to notify you about products, services, and other opportunities we think will be of interest to you. The information Corporation collects may be from:
