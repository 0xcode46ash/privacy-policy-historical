# Province of Manitoba | Privacy Notification

This policy applies to the handling of personal information that is collected via the Government of Manitoba web site.

Logging of Site Visitors  
Like most web servers, the Government of Manitoba server collects some information about visitors to the site. However, the server only logs the domain name of visitors. Depending on the setup of your internet service provider (ISP), this information may identify who you are; you may wish to contact your ISP for more information in this regard. The log data is analyzed for trends and statistics, and then aggregated.

If you have any questions about the information gathered automatically by our Web site, please contact the webmaster at [webmaster@gov.mb.ca](mailto:webmaster@gov.mb.ca).

Any personal information that you provide through the Government of Manitoba’s Web site is collected in compliance with The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA). The personal information that you provide will be used only for the purpose(s) for which it is collected, and not in any other way without your consent.

If you wish to have a brochure or other publication mailed to you, we will request your name and address.

In some other instances, it may be necessary for us to collect additional personal information in order to provide you with the service that you want. When personal information other than your name and mailing address is collected, you will be notified of

  * the purpose for which the information is being collected
  * the legal authority for the collection
  * the title and business address (including email address) of an official who will answer any questions you may have about the collection of the information
