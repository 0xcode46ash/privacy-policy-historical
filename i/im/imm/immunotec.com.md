At Immunotec, we only retain personal information that you submit when you make a request for automatic shipment of Immunotec products, when you purchase online or when you submit a request to become a Consultant. These forms ask for your consent for us to use your personal information in accordance with the uses set out in our policy regarding the protection of personal information.

#### Personal information and our website

It is possible to visit our website without revealing your identity. However, our web server may register the IP address and the domain that you used to access the site, the type and version of web browser and operating system that you use, the number, duration and frequency of visits made to our site, as well as the previous and next websites that you visit. This anonymous information cannot be associated with a particular user. This information is useful to us to monitor the performance of the site for system administration purposes, to make the site more user-friendly, to improve our services and to collect summary information (e.g.: the number of visitors who accessed the site).

We use cookies, which are small files that your web browser installs on your computer’s hard drive, to memorize the user code, password and preferences of users who visit our website, and to facilitate their navigation of the site. Cookies allow us to adapt a website or advertisement according to your interest and preferences. Rest assured that cookies are safe to use.

Our website includes security mechanisms that protect the information that you entrust to us against loss, abuse and modification. Our servers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a state-of-the-art encryption technology that is compatible with both Netscape Navigator (version 2.0 and later) and Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 3.0 and later). This technology protects your personal information and ensures its confidentiality. Personal information, in particular credit card numbers, names and addresses are encrypted and cannot be read by anyone while it is being transferred over the Internet.

#### Access to your personal information

You, your Consultant and the sponsoring Consultants of your Consultant have access to your personal information. However, authorized access for Consultants and their sponsors is strictly limited to your name, address, phone number and purchasing history.

We are committed to not disclose your personal information to third parties other than those mentioned in this policy or unless we are required to do so by law or regulation. As well, we will seek your consent should we decide to disclose your personal information to third parties other than those mentioned here.

#### Protecting your personal information

Immunotec is serious about protecting the personal information of our customers and our employees are trained to ensure all personnel information is respected, protected and handled appropriately. Only employees who have a legitimate need to access your personal information to fulfill their duties are authorized to do so. As well, a highly sophisticated computer system ensures the protection of personal information supported by this medium. All files, photocopies of cheques and written requests for automatic shipments of Immunotec products and for distribution are kept in locked filing cabinets in offices with limited access. Finally, all our service providers that require access to our facilities or our computing services are contractually obligated to neither divulge nor use personal information that we retain about our customers.

We limit the length of time we retain personal information about our customers to a period that allows us to supply our products and services, that allows us to respect the timeframes imposed by laws and regulations and that allows us to fulfill legal requirements. At the end of this period, we close each file, and we ensure that all personal information in our possession is destroyed.

We use our best efforts to keep the contents of your personal file up to date. This means that we rely on you to inform us of any changes. You can also help us maintain up-to-date information by periodically verifying the personal information about you in our possession, by informing our Chief Privacy Officer of any change to the personal information in our possession or by filling out the update form on our website at [www.immunotec.com](http://www.immunotec.com/).
