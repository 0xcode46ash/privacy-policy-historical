## Privacy statement

The _Privacy Act 1988_ defines personal information as 'information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent, or can reasonably be ascertained, from the information or opinion'.

The Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) manages this website and treats personal information as confidential.

The _Privacy Act 1988_ is the key law designed to protect your rights and prevent misuse of personal information collected by government agencies such as this department. 

Also, information received by this department is protected from unauthorised use and disclosure by virtue of specific provisions in the _Migration Act 1958_ , _Crimes Act 1914_ , _Public Service Act 1999_ and the _Public Service Regulations 1999_.

A breach of these laws may make an officer liable to criminal and/or civil penalty.

As a general rule, we do not collect personal information about you when you visit this site. You can generally visit this site without telling us who you are, unless you choose to provide such information.

This website contains links to other sites. The immigration website is not responsible for the content and the privacy practices of other websites and the department encourages you to read each site's privacy policies.
