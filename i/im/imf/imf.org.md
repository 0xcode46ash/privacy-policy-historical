The IMF does not distribute, sell or rent any personal information collected via its website. This is also true for personal information (email address, postal address, etc.) sent to the website’s email addresses. The IMF does not send unsolicited emails to users of its site. The transmission of personal information entered via the site’s registration forms (e.g. [IMF Online Employment Application form](https://www.imf.org/external/np/adm/rec/db/index.htm), Annual and Spring Meetings registration form) is protected by security features.

 **Policy on Cookies**

The IMF website analyzes aggregate usage data to find out how often and when site content is requested.
