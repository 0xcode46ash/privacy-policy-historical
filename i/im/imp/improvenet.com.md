**What is a privacy statement and why do you publish one?**  
A privacy statement explains how a website collects information about its users. It also describes the ways in which it uses this information. 

ImproveNet is publishing this statement so that you, our customers, will understand the premium we place on your patronage. This site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which is an industry standard protocol used for secure transmission of data across the Internet. SSL protects against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We know that you place your trust in us when you give us your personal information. In return, we want to disclose exactly how we plan to safeguard this data. 

**What information do you collect about your users?**  
Different parts of the ImproveNet website prompt you for different types of information. For example, while we might ask you for just your name and contact information to use our message boards, we ask for a credit card number if you request a contract review. 

Depending on the services you use on our site (or the surveys you respond to or the contests your enter), you might be asked to give us any of the following types of information: 

  * your name
  * your email address
  * your phone number
  * your zip code
  * your home-remodeling interests
  * the timing of your projects
  * your credit card number



Also, although you do not submit certain information to us directly, we use programs called "cookies" to detect and record your IP address, which is the virtual address of the computer you use to access the Internet. This numerical information helps us understand a few other facts about you, such as the type of computer and software you are using, the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, and other broad demographic facts. 

**What do you do with the information you gather?**  
ImproveNet never sells or gives your information to any list management firms. Most of the advertisers on our site are also not permitted to receive your personal information, although we may report aggregate data to them, such as the total number of jobs we’ve received by job type, etc. 

The exception is advertisers that use our “Find a Contractor” service on their own sites. If you ask one of our advertisers to find a professional where the search process is Powered by ImproveNet, the information you provide about that particular job is shared by ImproveNet and that advertiser. ImproveNet will not share that information with any other advertiser or any list firm. You will need to check the advertiser’s privacy statement regarding its policies. 

When you register to find a contractor, architect, or designer, your information is given out ONLY to those professionals interested in bidding on your project. We give you a list and contact information of the professionals to whom we have given your personal information (never more than four professionals). Your information is also used by us to track progress on your project and to get feedback from you on the professional you chose. 

We share Personally Identifiable Information with third parties. From time to time in our email correspondence with you, we will provide you the opportunity to receive information on home improvement related products and services from outside third parties who have a contractual affiliation with ImproveNet. In the event that you elect to receive such information by affirmatively OPTING IN in your response to the email for information from a particular outside third party, then ImproveNet will deliver your Personally Identifiable Information to such third party. The outside third parties that have a contractual affiliation with us have agreed to use your Personally Identifiable Information only for the specific purpose of providing to you the home improvement products and services named in the email. However, we can make no assurances that the Personally Identifiable Information is not used in some other manner. Please refer to each third party’s website for its policy regarding the use of Personally Identifiable Information it receives.
