####  What is a privacy statement and why do you publish one?

A privacy statement explains how a website collects information about its users. It also describes the ways in which it uses this information. 

ImproveNet is publishing this statement so that you, our customers, will understand the premium we place on your patronage. This site uses SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), which is an industry standard protocol used for secure transmission of data across the Internet. SSL protects against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We know that you place your trust in us when you give us your personal information. In return, we want to disclose exactly how we plan to safeguard this data. 

####  What information do you collect about your users?

Different parts of the ImproveNet website prompt you for different types of information. For example, while we might ask you for just your name and contact information to use our message boards, we ask for a credit card number if you request a contract review. 

Depending on the services you use on our site (or the surveys you respond to or the contests your enter), you might be asked to give us any of the following types of information: 

your name  
your email address   
your phone number   
your zip code  
your home-remodeling interests  
the timing of your projects  
your credit card number  


Also, although you do not submit certain information to us directly, we use programs called "cookies" to detect and record your IP address, which is the virtual address of the computer you use to access the Internet. This numerical information helps us understand a few other facts about you, such as the type of computer and software you are using, the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, and other broad demographic facts. 

####  What do you do with the information you gather?

ImproveNet never sells or gives your information to any list management firms. Most of the advertisers on our site are also not permitted to receive your personal information, although we may report aggregate data to them, such as the total number of jobs we’ve received by job type, etc. 

The exception is advertisers who are also business partners that use our “Find a Contractor” service on their own sites. If you ask one of our partners to find a professional where the search process is Powered by ImproveNet, the information you provide about that particular job is shared by ImproveNet and that partner. ImproveNet will not share that information with any other advertiser or any list firm. You will need to check the partner’s privacy statement regarding its policies. 

When you register to find a contractor, architect, or designer, your information is given out ONLY to those professionals interested in bidding on your project. We give you a list and contact information of the professionals to whom we have given your personal information (never more than four professionals). Your information is also used by us to track progress on your project and to get feedback from you on the professional you chose. 

Here are some examples of the ways we use your information: 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to make sure that you don't see the same advertisements over and over again. 

A "cookie" file is a data file that we write to your hard drive when you visit us. With this cookie we are able to track every time you come to our site and keep track of your preferences, login, and password. This information helps us serve content specific to you in a form you prefer. Cookies are also used to prepopulate forms you request on our site. If you prefer not to be "cookied," you can disable this function from your web browser. 

We use customer contact information from the registration form to send you tailored information about interests that you have indicated and promotional material from some of our partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary, such as informing you of updates to our site and alerting you to special offers from us or our advertisers. (Users may opt out of receiving future mailings, if they wish to.) 

When you register on our site, your information will give you access to various features of our site. When your register to Find a Contractor, Architect, or Designer, we use your information to contact you to audit the quality of the work done and match your job with our highest-rated prescreened professionals. Your information is only shared with those professionals interested in doing your project (never more than four). 

Our site uses billing information (like credit card numbers) only to bill a user for products and services he or she orders. 

If we are going to use your personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify you via email. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post the notice we will also email users, who have opted to receive communication from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
