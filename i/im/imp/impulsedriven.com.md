# Impulse : Secure Checkout Process

###  RETURN POLICY - Software published by Stardock

**We require that you utilize our technical support services prior to issuing a refund.** Tech support can be contacted at [ support@stardock.com](mailto:support@stardock.com). If it is determined that your problems cannot be rectified, technical support will instruct you on how to receive a full refund. Do not contact sales about a full refund without first contacting technical support. Sales will not fully refund your sale without an RMA from technical support. We do not charge for technical support.

**We do not give refunds on beta or pre-release versions of software or subscription renewals.** Refunds are only available for fully-released programs.

###  RETURN POLICY - 3rd party software via Impulse

If you purchased an application not published by Stardock and are seeking a refund, we must receive authorization from the publisher of the application in question to provide a full refund.

Refunds for 3rd party titles will be for Impulse store credit only, except instances approved by technical support where a customer has been unable to download/install a title through Impulse.

**Some of our 3rd party titles offer beta access with pre-orders. If you pre-order a game to gain access to its beta, a refund is no longer possible when your order is processed and beta access has been granted.**

**We offer the capability to pre-load certain titles via Impulse if you place a pre-order. If you pre-order a game to gain access to the pre-load, a refund is no longer possible when your order is processed and pre-load access has been granted.**

**There are no refunds for Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games.**

**There are no refunds for games published by Electronic Arts.**

###  RETURN POLICY - General

Refund requests on all credit/debit card orders must be received within 90 days of the transaction. No partial or full refunds will be granted after this time.

PayPal orders can only be refunded for 60 days after purchase date.

Please note that most Stardock programs have demo versions available for preview prior to buying. Since we do offer shareware versions and customer service is available to answer any questions about the software before and after ordering, full refunds will not be issued for functional software that does not live up to your expectations. We DO NOT have a "try before you buy" policy; this is why we offer shareware versions of our programs for evaluation. Please use the shareware versions prior to purchase if you are unsure if you want to purchase the product.

For Stardock Products Only - Please review the minimum system requirements for our software carefully. If you request a refund and your computer does not meet the minimum system requirements, you will receive a partial refund of 75%.

If you are not willing to work with technical support on any problems you are having, or request a refund even if you are not having problems using the software, we will issue a partial refund of 75%. To receive a partial refund, please email [ sales@stardock.com](mailto:sales@stardock.com).

We try to process refunds within 5 business days of receipt, but refunds may take up to 2 weeks to process. An original signature on all refund request letters is required due to card processing regulations.

Stardock is open Monday through Friday, 8 am to 4 pm Eastern Time. If you experience problems ordering, registering, or using your software and contact us for help, please allow reasonable time for us to respond. Please do not reorder. We will not provide full refunds for duplicate orders under these circumstances. If you do not receive a serial number after the first order, there is probably something wrong with your email address, or routing to you; reordering will not fix this, so please do not reorder. Please email if you did not receive your serial number, and allow us 1 business day to respond. We make every effort to keep our systems up 24/7, but there are conditions beyond our control that may prevent processing to be fully functional.

If you have made errors entering your personal information on our order form, please send an email to [sales@stardock.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20110414174548id_/https%3A//store.stardock.com/sales@stardock.com). Do not reorder. We will not provide full refunds for duplicate orders under these circumstances.
