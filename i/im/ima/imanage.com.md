We transfer personal information to third parties such as vendors and service providers who perform tasks on our behalf such as for processing and storage purposes.

### International Data Transfers

We have our headquarters in the United States. Personal information we collect from you will be primarily processed in the United States, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and in other countries and territories. To facilitate our global operations, we may transfer and access such personal information from around the world, including from other countries in which any member of the iManage companies has operations for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy. If you are visiting our websites from the EEA or other regions with laws governing data collection and use, please note that you are agreeing to the transfer of your personal information to the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. By providing your personal information, you consent to any transfer and processing in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Data subject rights

The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation and other countries’ privacy laws provide certain rights for data subjects. A good explanation of them (in English) is available on the website of the United Kingdom’s Information Commissioner’s Office.

This Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with information about what personal information we collect about you and how it is used. If you have any questions, please contact us at [privacy@imanage.com](mailto:privacy@imanage.com).

### Security of your personal information

To help protect the privacy of personal information you transmit to us, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards. We update and test our security technology on an ongoing basis. We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who need to know that personal information to provide benefits or services to you. In addition, we train our employees about the importance of confidentiality and maintaining the privacy and security of your personal information. We commit to taking appropriate disciplinary measures to enforce our employees’ privacy responsibilities.

### Data storage and retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as is needed to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

For personal information that we process on behalf of our customers, we will retain such personal information in accordance with the terms of our agreement with them, subject to applicable law.

We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at [privacy@imanage.com](mailto:privacy@imanage.com).

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

If we modify this Privacy Policy, we will post the revised policy here, with an updated revision date. If we make significant changes to this Privacy Policy that materially alter our privacy practices, we may also notify you by other means, such as sending an email or posting a notice on our corporate website and/or social media pages prior to the changes taking effect.
