# ImageChef Privacy Policy

ImageChef collects aggregate statistical data on web site traffic.

No user information or e-mail addresses is shared with any third parties, with the exception of what is required to release to our credit card gateway partner for executing a purchase.

Cookies are pieces of information that a web site may place on your computer. ImageChef may use cookies to authenticate user sessions or provide other services. 

You can set your computer's browser settings to warn you each time a cookie is being sent, block third party cookies or block all cookies. Note that by blocking all cookies you may not have access to all of ImageChef's features. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). 

Some of our users may be shown a special offer after first registering on our site, offered by a partner. The user's personal information will be shown and he/she will be given the option of sending that information to the partner to sign up for a service, or to decline the offer. 

For sales, credit card information is not stored by ImageChef. User passwords are stored in encrypted format so they may not be read by anyone. Our servers are stored in a secure remote facility.
