## Privacy Policy and Data Processing Notice

Integrated Management Systems Hong Kong Limited (”We”) are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy.

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains what Personal Data we collect from you, through our interactions with you and through our products, and how we use that data.

Our Group means our ultimate holding company INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS HONG KONG LIMITED and its subsidiary INTER BIZTECH SOLUTIONS LIMITED.

This notice sets out the basis on which any Personal Data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

We respect your privacy rights about your Personal Data and do so in accordance with the Hong Kong Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap 486) (“Ordinance”) and the new General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (“ **GDPR** ”).

The GDPR is a new regulation which replaces the Data Protection Regulation (Directive 95/46/EC). The Regulation aims to harmonise data protection legislation across EU member states, enhancing privacy rights for individuals and providing a strict framework within which commercial organisations can legally operate.

Your new rights under the GDPR are set out in this notice but will only apply once the GDPR becomes law on 25th May 2018.

This statement applies to our interactions with you and any third-party software that we may use on your behalf as outlined below or agreed upon at time of contractual service agreement.

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your Personal Data and how we will treat it.

We are not required to appoint a Data Protection Officer. However, correspondence on any data protection matters should be marked for the attention of Anastasios Papadopoulos at Integrated Management Systems, 36/F, 41 Heung Yip Road, Wong Chuk Hang, Hong Kong.

## How we use personal data

The core service we offer to our clients is the implementation of digital services, including digital transformation, advanced analytics, strategic planning, marketing, organisation and operations.

Our legal basis for the processing of Personal Data is our legitimate business interests, described in more detail below, and also the performance of a contract, legal obligations and consent for some specific uses of data.

We will rely on contract if we are negotiating or have entered into an agreement for consulting services with you or your organisation or any other contract to provide services to you or receive services from you or your organisation.

We will rely on legal obligation if we are legally required to process information relating to you to fulfil our legal obligations.

We will in some circumstances rely on consent for particular uses of your data, and you will be asked for your express consent if legally required.

_We use information held about you in the following ways:_

To carry out our obligations arising from any contracts we intend to enter into or have entered into between you and us and to provide you with the information, products and services that you request from us or we think will be of interest to you because it is relevant to you or your organisation.

Providing and improving our services: We use data to provide and improve the services we offer and perform essential business operations. This includes providing service, maintaining and improving our services, conducting research, and providing customer support. Examples of such uses include the following:

  * Providing services. We use data to carry out your interactions with us and to provide our services to you, which includes collection and (statistical) analysing of information for individual profiling; Often, those services include personalised content and recommendations that enhance your productivity and automatically tailor your experience with us based on the data we have about your activities, interests and location.
  * Customer support. We use data to identify the services provided to you by us and provide other customer care and support services. The data we collect helps us to respond to customer service requests and support needs more effectively.

  * Security, Safety and Dispute Resolution. We use data to protect the security and safety of our customers, to detect and prevent fraud and enforce our agreements.
  * Business Operations. We use data to develop aggregate analysis and business intelligence that enable us to operate, protect, make informed decisions, and report on the performance of our business.
  * To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other Site feature. To send you the information you agreed to receive about topics we think will be of interest to you.
  * To personalise User experience. We may use information in the aggregate to understand how our Users as a group use the services and resources provided on our Site.
  * To process transactions. We may use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to provide service to that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide the service.
  * To provide you with information about other services we offer that are similar to those that you have already purchased, been provided with or enquired about.
  * To send periodic emails. The private or corporate email address you provide for order processing will only be used to send you or your company information and updates pertaining to your order.

In carrying out these purposes, we may combine data we collect to give you a more seamless, consistent and personalised experience. However, to enhance privacy, we have built in technological and procedural safeguards designed to prevent certain data combinations.

In the course of our Services, we will analyse your information to build individual profiles. These profiles will be used to predict future interests and display targeted (online) advertisement. The aim is to provide you with offers that are relevant and interesting for you. The profiling is based on your (surfing)behaviour on the internet. This includes the viewing of advertisements, any interaction with it and the overlap between desktop and mobile usage.

We will obtain your prior consent before processing your information for its own purposes, unless we have a legitimate interest to process your information. If you have given your consent to the processing, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time, by sending an email to that extent to: [support@imanagesystems.com](mailto:support@imanagesystems.com). We will discontinue the processing of your information upon receipt of your withdrawal. However, any processing performed prior to your withdrawal remains a legitimate processing based on a valid consent at the time. We will not be under the obligation to reverse the processing.

## Our Legitimate Business Interests
