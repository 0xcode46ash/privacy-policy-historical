#### 3\. Purpose of using Personal Data

DigiDNA only collects and processes your Personal Data for specific and limited needs. For example, we may collect and use your e-mail address to reply to your customer support requests, to send you newsletters, or to communicate with you for other related purposes.

In addition, we may use your Personal Data for assessing the efficiency of our services and improving them, for the benefit of our visitors and our customers, for our internal statistics or other requirements of our business, for assessing the interest of our customers, and for better defining the development of our services. By forwarding us your Personal Data, you grant this use implicitly. DigiDNA only keeps your Personal Data for the time required to achieve these purposes.

#### 4\. Nondisclosure of information

DigiDNA never sells, rents, shares or spreads your Personal Data with third parties not listed in point 2, except if legal dispositions or administrative regulations require it.

#### 5\. Access Right

You can request access to your Personal Data at anytime to update or delete it by sending us a message: <https://imazing.com/contact>. Ensure regularly that your Personal Data is up to date and accurate.

#### 6\. Safety/Confidentiality

All communications between your web browser and iMazing.com, as well as between our software products and our servers, are secured by strong SSL encryption.  
Furthermore, access to Personal Data is restricted to employees directly involved in customer support and analytics - they have been trained to observe our strict standards of confidentiality and respect. However, it must be noted that the Internet is generally not regarded as a completely secure environment, and that DigiDNA is not liable for damages and privacy breaches resulting from malicious attacks of any kind.
