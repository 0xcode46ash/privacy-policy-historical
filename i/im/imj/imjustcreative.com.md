To start with, what you need to know is that I am not interested in taking any personal information and using for personal profit or gain, and certainly I am not going to be sharing any of it with anyone out of my 4 walls. Long documents are all very well, but in this case this will be a short affair. So here’s the information you _need_ to know:

  * We use cookies with minimal information in them. See below for details.
  * We use Google Analytics, which is covered by [Google’s Privacy Policy.](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy.html)
  * I use any information purely for myself in terms of effective Web Analytics and SEO to improve my site only.
  * We allow you to contact other members via profile pages and comments, but no private information is sent.
  * Any comments that you leave are your responsibility, if you choose to display personal information in the post I cannot be responsible for any negative consequences that may arise.
  * At [ImJustCreative](http://imjustcreative.com/) your name and email address are collected, but never publicly displayed or used by 3rd Parties.
