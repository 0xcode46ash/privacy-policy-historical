### Data that we collect and our use of it

#### 1\. Developer Portals

When you and other developers participate in technical discussions and provide Product feedback on Websites such as our PowerVR Insider Forum on the Imagination Website, we collect and analyse the discussions, review feedback on our Products and store the information you provide upon registration. We may use that information for internal purposes to update our Products, design and develop new products and services, analyse the use of our Websites, respond to your queries, allow you to access certain restricted areas on our Websites and to provide you with information and updates regarding our Products. By posting any information on any of our discussion forums you are disclaiming all intellectual property and moral rights in and to the content of your submissions and you acknowledge that we can use the information posted by you in any manner we see fit.

#### 2\. Product Warranty Registrations

When you register a warranty for a new Product that you have received, we may receive the following information about you: your name, date of birth, address, email address, telephone numbers, Product details, serial number for the Product, where you obtained the Product, the date on which you obtained the Product, why you bought the Product and what you are considering buying next. We need that information to verify that you are entitled to receive a warranty, and to verify the dates on which your warranty is applicable. We may use that information when carrying out any servicing or repairs to the Product that you have obtained, and we may also pass that information on to anyone carrying out servicing or repairs on our behalf. We may also use your information in case we have marketing messages, upgrade, safety or recall reasons and any other queries. If there is a free prize draw for any warranty cards supplied by us, we may also use that information for the purposes of entering you in the draw, and we may also use the information in the ways described in the section below relating to promotions.

#### 3\. Promotions

When you enter a promotion (such as a free prize draw) run by us or if you are a winner of the promotion, you may supply various information about yourself or someone else, or we may receive or gather information supplied about you. For example, the information we may collect may include your name, date of birth, email address, telephone numbers, address, photograph, whether and how you are connected with us, information about Products (including, but not limited to, serial number, purchased from, purchase/sale date, reason for buying the radio, what you are thinking of buying next) and Services and software we supply, how you heard about us or the Product or the Services or the Websites, and your use of the Product or Services. If you participate in a retailer prize draw, your employer or manager’s details. Some of this information is for the purpose of entering the promotion and for validating your entry.

We may also use your information in case we have any queries.

We may also use your email address that you initially give to us to enable you to commence using the Services and to validate information you have given to us. If you are a winner of a promotion (such as a free prize draw), we may display some information about you on the Websites or in our other marketing materials, but we shall not be responsible if any third party misuses that information.

We may use your contact details to respond to you any queries you raise with us.  
We may email you with your password if you tell us or the Websites that you have forgotten it.  
We may also use your data to send you feedback forms to complete about us or our Products or Services, and to contact you over any aspect of the Products or Services or the Websites.

By publishing your data on the Websites or our promotional and marketing material, this information may be accessible internationally including in countries outside the European Economic Area. Some places outside of the EEA may not have adequate data protection laws at all or may offer differing levels of protection of personal information which are not as high as in the UK. By submitting your data (or allowing your data to be submitted) to us or to the Websites, you acknowledge that provided we have used your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy, we cannot be held responsible for any use of your data by third parties who receive and process your data.

We use your password to allow you to use restricted parts of the Websites. We use that to enable you or anyone you represent or who represents you to access your restricted parts on the Websites.  
You must only submit to us or the Websites information which is accurate and not misleading and you must keep it up to date and inform us of changes. By submitting information about you or anyone else, you must ensure that you have full authority and consent to supply us with that information on everyone’s behalf and you warrant to us that you have that authority.

### Third Parties and Links

We may pass information about you or your Products to anyone carrying out servicing or repairs on our behalf.

If you take part in a promotion, we may pass on your details to anyone who administers the distribution or redemption of prizes.

We may pass your details to other companies in our group. We may also pass your details to our agents and subcontractors to help us with any of our uses of your data set out in our Privacy Policy.

We may exchange information with third parties for the purposes of fraud protection and  
credit risk reduction.

We may transfer our databases containing your personal information if we sell our business  
or part of it.

We may also disclose your details as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy.

Other than as set out in this Privacy Policy, we shall NOT sell or disclose your personal data to third parties without obtaining your prior consent unless this is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy or unless we are required to do so by law.

The Websites may contain advertising of third parties, dedicated pages operated by third parties and links to other Websites or frames of other Websites (including links to access radio stations operated by third parties). Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those third parties or other websites or services, nor for any third party to whom we transfer your data in accordance with our Privacy Policy.

### Generic Data

We may aggregate and anonymise data relating to you so that the aggregated and anonymised data does not identify you or any individual personally. We may supply that aggregated and anonymised data to any third party without recourse to you or any other user.

### Security

We have in place appropriate technical and security measures to prevent unauthorised access and accidental loss of your data.

We store your personal details on a secure server. We use industry standard security and firewalls on our servers. When we collect payment card details electronically, we use encryption by using Secure Website Certificate technology. Whilst we are unable to guarantee 100% security, this makes it hard for a hacker to decrypt your details.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage and disclosure of your information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity, for example, your password, before we disclose personal information to you.  
You are responsible for protecting against unauthorised access to your password and to your computer.
