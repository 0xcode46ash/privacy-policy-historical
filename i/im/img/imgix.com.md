# imgix - Privacy Policy

Please read this document carefully: if you use Imgix's Services, you consent to the terms of our Privacy Policy.

* * *

### Information We Collect from You

**Information We Need from You During Registration:** When you register to use our Services, you must create an account. To create an account, you must provide us with your name, email address, password, company information (if applicable), and what plan you will use (collectively, "Account Information.") We need all of this information so that we can provide our Services, contact you when necessary, and handle your billing.

**Financial Information:** When you register with us, we also ask for your financial information, which is handled by our third-party payment processing service, Stripe, and is never stored on our servers. Whenever your financial information is processed by Stripe, it is subject to Stripe's [Terms of Service](https://stripe.com/us/terms/) and [Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/privacy). Please read these documents closely, because by using our paid Services, you agree to Stripe's user agreements as well.

**Log Data:** During your use of our Services, we use our own technology and some third-party services to collect basic technical and diagnostic information about how you use our Services. We need this information for debugging and diagnostic purposes, and generally to improve our Services. We do not share this information.

**Image Metadata:** When we Process images for you, we may collect some metadata about the image, like EXIF data and other data about an image (like whether it contains a horizon line, whether there are people in it, and so on). We use this metadata only for our own internal purposes, like making our image-processing software smarter. We will never identify people in images, and we do not ask for personally identifiable information or knowingly associate it with any images.

### You Control Your Images

**Caching:** Any image we Process is Processed only at your direction. You control whether any image from your storage or hosting location appears to the public or is Processed by Imgix.

* * *

### When We Share Your Information

**Your Images Are Private:** We do not sell, share, or disclose images we Process to third parties, with the exception of third-party service providers we engage to perform some specialized functions and services, like CDNs. These third parties are subject to terms we make with them, and our relationships with them are strictly for the purposes of providing our Services to you. We only disclose or share your images to the public at your direction (e.g., when we cache and serve an image for you).

**Law Enforcement:** We may preserve or disclose your information if we believe—after due consideration—that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation, or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security, or technical issues; or to protect our rights or property. If it is legal and reasonably possible for us to do so, we will notify you of any request for your information before preserving or disclosing it, so that you have an opportunity to obtain counsel.

### Cookies

We use a few different types of cookies to help us provide our Services to you. Cookies are small data files (not programs) that we place on your machine to help us provide our Services to you. (You can always block or delete cookies through your browser if you so choose, but some of our Services will not work unless you allow us to place cookies on your machine, so we highly recommend that you allow cookies from our domain.)

We use only the following cookies:

> **Login Cookies:** We use a session cookie to keep track of when you are logged-in, so that you only need to log in once per session. Session cookies like our login cookie disappear when you log out and close your browser.
> 
> **Admin Assistance Cookies:** We use a special type of session cookie we call an "Admin Assistance Cookie" if you ask us to help you solve a problem that we can only solve from your perspective. When we use the Admin Assistance Cookie, we can log into our systems as a customer (without needing to obtain someone's username or password) for the limited purpose of troubleshooting and problem-solving from our customers' points of view, so that we can see problems that can only be replicated by seeing what our customers see.
> 
> **Analytics Cookies:** We use Google Analytics cookies to store information about how you use our site, but we engineered our site so that Google Analytics can't track you from page to page.

### General Information

**Sale or Merger:** If Imgix is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.

**Policy Changes:** Changes in laws, regulations, policies, or business practices may occasionally require us to revise this Privacy Policy. If we do so in a materially significant way, we will notify you via the email provided in your Account Information. The most current version of our Privacy Policy is always located at <http://www.imgix.com/privacy>. If you continue to use Imgix's Services after these changes become effective, you have agreed to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.
