Privacy Notice   
   
Mercer Human Resource Consulting ("Mercer") takes your privacy seriously because we know that you do. This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes how we collect and use information related to this Site. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, to persons we do not employ, or to Web sites we do not own or operate.   
   
By accessing, browsing, or using this Site, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted the practices described in this Policy. Please read this Policy carefully and be aware that we may change it at any time. We last revised this Policy on 17 October 2001.   
   
Use of Site   
   
You can use this Site to learn about and buy products and services provided by Mercer and its affiliated companies ("Mercer Companies").   
   
This Site is intended for adults. If you are not yet 18 years old or lack the legal authority to form legally binding contracts under applicable law, please do not use this Site. We do not solicit or knowingly collect any information from visitors under 18 years of age.   
   
Information We Collect   
   
We collect the domain names of visitors to this Site to measure the number of visits, pages visited, and average time spent on the Site. We also collect the e-mail addresses and other contact information you provide when you send us e-mail messages, complete a registration form or other submission form, or request or buy goods, services, or other information from us.   
   
We use this information to provide you with the goods, services, or information that you request. When visitors specifically request information from us through the Site or buy goods or services from us through the Site, we may use your information to provide you with information reports as well as information about goods and services offered by Mercer Companies. To stop getting general e-mails or communications from us, simply tell us so in a reply to any e-mail we send you.   
   
A cookie is a small text file that a web site stores on your computer to identify you during a visit and between visits so you can avoid re-entering user ID. Like many other sites, ours uses "cookies" to enable our systems to recognize your browser and to navigate this Site more easily. For all visitors to this Site, we use cookies to collect clickstream data, including:   
   
The Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet; computer and connection information such as browser type and version, operating system, and platform; the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) from which you linked to this Site; and possibly, certain other web protocol header information.   
   
We may also track your path through this Site to deliver information and Mercer product/service offerings that may be of interest to you while you are on the Site.   
   
Through collected clickstream data, including cookies, we may also analyze Users' Site use history. We also use information related to Site pages you visit and other information you provide to us to contact you through e-mail to send you information about Mercer product/service offerings that may be of interest to you. If you ever want us to stop contacting you by e-mail, send an e-mail to [surveys@mercer.com](mailto:surveys@mercer.com) or update your profile information through registration maintenance.   
   
Sharing and Disclosure of Information   
   
Mercer is not in the business of selling personally identifiable information to others. Mercer may, however, share or disclose information you provide us to other companies and people under the following circumstances:   
   
**Agents and Service Providers.** We sometimes employ or contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as sending e-mail or delivering packages. They have access to only such information about Users as is needed to perform their functions, but may not use any of this information for other purposes.   
   
**Business Transfers.** As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, customer and User information generally is one of the transferred business assets. If any Mercer Company or substantially all of any Mercer Company's assets were acquired, User information would be one of the transferred assets. We do not offer for sale personally identifiable information other than in connection with business-related transfers.   
   
**Legal Matters.** Mercer and other Mercer Companies have the right to disclose any personal information about you or your use of the Service without your prior permission if that Mercer or such other Mercer Company has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
   
Protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of any Mercer Company or its affiliates, customers, or suppliers, other users of this Site, or the public; or respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third parties.   
   
We may also disclose information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request.   
   
Your Instructions. We may share any information you submit on or to the Site when we have your consent to do so or when we need to share it to provide the information or service you have requested.   
   
Mercer does aggregate personally identifiable information and may disclose aggregated information to third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you.   
   
Links   
   
This Site contains links to other sites. The privacy policies at these other sites may be different from this Policy. Those sites' privacy policies will govern the use of information you provide to them.   
   
Security   
   
We place a high priority on the security of visitor and User information. We maintain the Site and all associated data with technical, administrative, and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification, and improper disclosure. The information you enter on the Site, including registration information and your account password, are stored securely by Mercer on our data servers. However, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. Mercer is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect this Site and its information against foreseeable hazards.   
   
You must maintain the confidentiality of your username and password, and are responsible for restricting unauthorized access to your computer.   
   
Storage of and Access to Information   
   
All information that you submit through this Site is collected, stored, and processed in the United States. But we may transfer User information to Mercer Company offices and service providers throughout the world as we seek to improve the content of this Site or fulfill a user request.   
   
You may review, correct, update, or delete the information that we maintain about you by updating your profile information through registration maintenance. We may retain such information for a period in our backup systems as a precaution against system failures. We may retain some information for longer periods as required by law, contract, or auditing requirements.
