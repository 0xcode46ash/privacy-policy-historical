# Privacy Policy, Service Policies - ImHosted.com

 

Privacy for our customers is extremely important to ImHosted™. We strongly believe in individual's rights to privacy and that personal information is not a commodity and should not be treated as one. At all times we will never share your personal information with any third parties without your permission. 

Your email addresses are not for sale or trade and are strictly guarded. Our Acceptable Usage Policy prohibits our customers from sending unsolicited bulk commercial email (aka "spam") using our services. If it is brought to our attention that one of our customers is violating this policy, we take steps to stop them and ensure it doesn't happen again. We also do everything within our power to keep non-customers from using our email servers for spam. 

All client information such as email, phone numbers, addresses, etc is used only for internal purposes. This contact information is used to get in touch with you when necessary and for announcements and our monthly newsletter. Financial information that is collected is used to bill you for products and services. 

**To Cancel your account**

Any request for cancellation must be received via the web, regular mail or fax and you will receive a confirmation upon the cancellation of your account. **Cancellations over the telephone and informal email are not accepted.**

You may use any of following methods to deliver a written notice of cancellation:

**Online:** Please email cancel@imhosted.com. We will direct you to a form you can use to cancel your account.

**Fax:** Fax your request to 1-206-350-1766; please include your domain name, password and your reason for cancelling on your cover letter for fastest processing of your request. Please include your contact information in case we need to get in touch with you. 

Setup fees, when applicable, are non-refundable. You are obligated to pay for your account even if you do not use it. Because we have provided you with usernames, passwords, DNS entries, and an IP address, you have the ability to use your account. The fact that you do not do so is not relevant - you are still obligated to pay for the account. Even an unused account uses valuable system resources that could be used for other customers. If you have a past-due balance on your account at the time the account is closed (either by your request or due to non-payment), the remaining balance must be paid within 30 days of when the account is closed. If we do not receive payment on the remaining balance in that time, we will begin efforts to collect any fees owed. We apply a $20.00 collection fee to cover our costs in attempting to collect your debt. If our internal collection efforts fail, we reserve the right to turn the account over to a 3rd-party (either collections agency or attorney) for further action. We also reserve the right to report your unpaid balance to credit reporting agencies.

If client disputes justified charges by provider on his credit card, provider has the right to charge a $50 administration fee in addition to the regular suspension charge of $25 and immediately discontinue service.
