Ipsos Interactive Services Limited, commonly known as IIS, is a company registered in the United Kingdom. IIS is part of the Ipsos worldwide group of companies. This privacy policy explains how we use any personal information we collect about you when you join our on-line panel, take part in surveys or use the panel members website.

## What information do we collect about you?

We collect the information you provide by email and in completing our recruitment questionnaire when you decide to join our panel. We also collect information when you voluntarily complete any of the surveys we invite you to participate in, or you provide feedback, comments or other information on our panel members website.

## How will we use the information you provide?

We will use the information you provide to:

  * Keep a record of all panel members.
  * Send you invitations to participate in surveys that are relevant to you based on the information you provided in response to our recruitment questionnaire(s).
  * Append personal information about you to your responses to any surveys you participate in, such as geographical location, ethnicity, occupation categories etc for the purpose of analysing the survey responses and producing anonymous, statistical research results.
  * Enter you into any prize draws that you are eligible to take part in or, where invited to do so, have asked to be entered into.
  * With your explicit consent when asked in a survey, to pass your individual survey responses together with your personal information to the client who commissioned the survey. The client will use this information only for research purposes as explained in the survey. The client may also use this information to contact you in order to invite your participation in further research they conduct, but only where you have been informed of this and have explicitly consented to your information being used by the client for this purpose.
  * To create anonymous, statistical profiles of panel membership based on the information provided by panel members.
  * With your consent, to pass your information to other Ipsos Group companies so that they may invite you to participate in research studies they are carrying out that may relevant to you.



We may also send your information to sub-contractor companies who are conducting some of the work we do on our behalf, and under our control.

We will NEVER use your information for any purpose other than research. We will NOT try to sell you anything, nor use your information for marketing purposes. Nor will we ever pass your information to third parties for marketing purposes.

## Cookies

Some on-line surveys collect information through the use of 'cookies'. These are small files stored on your computer. These files are used as sparingly as possible and only for quality control, validation and, more importantly, to prevent us sending you reminders for any on-line survey you have already completed. It is possible for you to delete 'cookies' or to prevent their use by adjusting the browser settings on your computer.

We also automatically capture information about your browser type in order to ensure that the survey questionnaire is delivered in a form suited to the software your computer is using. We do not capture any other information from your computer.

Neither the information collected in cookies nor about your browser type is stored by us. Nor is this information linked by our systems to the personal data or survey responses you provide.

## Digital fingerprints

We may use digital fingerprinting technology, also known as "Machine Identification" digital fingerprints, to gather certain information about your computer hardware and software, for example, your IP address, the display settings of your monitor, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, etc. This information is sent to our trusted third-party partner who converts it into a unique serial number – the digital "fingerprint" – and determines if it matches previous fingerprints. The data collected in this process and the digital fingerprint created is not tied to any of your personal information, is stored on secured servers, and is used only to help prevent panellists from completing the same survey many times and for no other purpose.

## How long will we keep the information you provide?

We will keep the information you provided when you joined our panel, together with any information you provided in response to a recruitment questionnaire for as long as you remain a member of the panel. You can leave the panel at any time you wish. We may also remove you from our panel if you are not taking part in any surveys, are no longer eligible to be a member of any other reason, or the panel is closed. Before removing anyone from our panel, we will contact them to let them know and provide details of how to remain a panel member where appropriate. However, in the event we consider you breach IIS' rules or terms and conditions, IIS may remove you from our panel without any notice and your access to the panellist website and to your points account will be closed.

When you leave the panel, are removed, or the panel is closed, we will delete all your contact details, together with any other information that could be used to identify you, leaving only anonymous responses to surveys that you participated in.

## How can you get access to your information and/or correct it?
