## 1\. What information do we collect about you?

We collect the information you provide by email and in completing our recruitment questionnaire when you decide to join our panel.

We collect your Facebook basic profile information (meaning your name, e-mail address, gender, birthday and location) that you have consented to our using when you connect to, and use the Ipsos Access Panels Facebook Applications within your Facebook account.

We also collect information when you voluntarily complete any of the surveys we invite you to participate in, or you provide feedback, comments or other information on our panel members’ website.

## 2\. How will we use the information you provide?

We will use the information you provide to:

  * Keep a record of all panel members.
  * Send you invitations to participate in surveys that are relevant to you based on the information you provided in response to our recruitment questionnaire(s).
  * Append personal information about you to your responses to any surveys you participate in, such as geographical location, ethnicity, occupation categories etc for the purpose of analysing the survey responses and producing anonymous, statistical research results.
  * Enter you into any prize draws that you are eligible to take part in or, where invited to do so, have asked to be entered into.
  * With your explicit consent when asked in a survey, to pass your individual survey responses together with your personal information to the client who commissioned the survey. The client will use this information only for research purposes as explained in the survey. The client may also use this information to contact you in order to invite your participation in further research they conduct, but only where you have been informed of this and have explicitly consented to your information being used by the client for this purpose.
  * To create anonymous, statistical profiles of panel membership based on the information provided by panel members.
  * With your consent, to pass your information to other Ipsos Group companies so that they may invite you to participate in research studies they are carrying out that may relevant to you.



If you join our Panel+ program and install the Ipsos Panel+ Application, we will also collect information from you via the Ipsos Panel+ Application. This Application will collect the following information:

  * a) Details of any advertising material, including any audio or video advertising material that the App presented to you in place of, or in addition to the actual advertising material contained on the website visited.
  * b) In order to help with any requests for help or support when installing, using or uninstalling our App, the App also logs the following events: 
    * Date and time of installation and when uninstalled.
    * Installation failure reason. For example, the version of Windows™ is too old to support the App, user has insufficient rights on the machine to install software, "other" error occurred, or user cancelled the installation.
    * Dates and times when the App is active.
  * c) When you consent to our doing so, we will also use the Application to automatically collect information on how you use the internet. The information collected will vary from project to project, but will only include following: 
    * Use of key words in comments or website posts you may make.
    * Details of any Internet search engine queries and the results presented to you.
    * User clicks.
    * Details of any advertisements displayed to you online , including any audio or video advertising.
    * Information about the websites you may have visited. This information includes: 
      * All visited website addresses (URLs);
      * Website addresses accessed by individual webpage's as they load (also known as "Background Requests"); and
      * Details of any audio or video content accessed via the website (for example "YouTube" video content that has been viewed).



With the exception of checking for key words included in any comment or other online post you may make, our Ipsos Panel+ Application does not collect keystrokes or information that is entered into a web-form, such as website user-ids, passwords, credit card numbers, other financial account numbers or other private data or any other data on a page in secure session. As a result, the Application will normally not have access to any information regarding items in a website shopping basket or your interactions with financial or health-related websites that you may log into as these are normally secure sites.

However, in the event that any such private data is displayed in a URL, it is possible that such data will be collected. In addition, on certain "social networking" sites, posts, updates and pictures are unsecured and typically included as part of the page's source code. As a result, it is possible that we may gain access to your personal information, including sensitive health or financial information based on the way that certain websites display information. Please be assured that collecting such personal information is not the purpose of Ipsos Panel+, and any such data will be securely deleted from our systems if found to have been collected.

For further details about how the Ipsos Panel+ Application works, please see the Application Information Sheet that can be found [here](http://www.iap-interactive.com/InfosheetPanel/tabid/246/language/en-GB/Default.aspx).

We may also send your information to our sub-contractors who may carry out some of the work we do on our behalf, and under our control.

We will NEVER use your information for any purpose other than research. We will NOT try to sell you anything, nor use your information for marketing purposes. Nor will we ever pass your information to third parties for marketing purposes.

## 5\. Use of Digital fingerprinting?

We also use digital fingerprinting technology, also known as "Machine Identification" digital fingerprints, to gather certain information about your computer hardware and software, for example, your IP address, the display settings of your monitor, the type of browser you are using, the type of operating system you are using, etc. This information is sent to our trusted third-party partner who converts it into a unique serial number – the digital "fingerprint" – and determines if it matches previous fingerprints. The data collected in this process and the digital fingerprint created is not tied to any of your personal information, is stored on secured servers, and is only used for quality control purposes and to help prevent panellists from completing the same survey many times, and for no other purpose.

## 6\. How long will we keep the information you provide?

We will keep the information you provided when you joined our panel, together with any information you provided in response to a recruitment questionnaire for as long as you remain a member of the panel. You can leave the panel at any time you wish. We may also remove you from our panel if you are not taking part in any surveys, are no longer eligible to be a member of any other reason, or the panel is closed. Before removing anyone from our panel, we will contact them to let them know and provide details of how to remain a panel member where appropriate. However, in the event we consider you breach IIS' rules or terms and conditions, IIS may remove you from our panel without any notice and your access to the panellist website and to your points account will be closed.

When you leave the panel, are removed, or the panel is closed, we will delete all your contact details, together with any other information that could be used to identify you, leaving only anonymous responses to surveys that you participated in.
