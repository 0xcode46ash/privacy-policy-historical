# Privacy Statement

_Updated: July 17, 2014_

At the International Association of Privacy Professionals, we know you care about your personal privacy and about the terms and conditions that govern your use of this Web site (this "Site"). Because we are dedicated to serving your needs and respecting your preferences, we have adopted the policies and practices described in this Privacy Statement and Conditions of Use.

#### Our Collection and Use of Your Personally Identifiable Information

In general, we collect and use information about you for membership administration, to deliver member benefits (e.g., our newsletter) and to inform you of IAPP-related conferences, benefits and/or other opportunities. Except as described herein, we do not sell, rent or otherwise share or disclose your private, personally identifiable information to third parties.

Because of the nature of our business, our services and benefits are not designed to appeal to minors. We do not knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

The IAPP specifically collects information from you at several different points, including but not limited to the following:

### Information You Provide to Us

The IAPP primarily collects information in connection with IAPP membership, services, products and IAPP-related conference registrations. The IAPP will treat any information of its members and conference attendees as confidential and will not disclose it to any third party (other than in connection with IAPP co-sponsored conferences as described below) without consent. We do not rent, sell or otherwise disclose personal information for non-conference related mailings. If you do not wish to receive the IAPP newsletter or have specific contact preferences, you may express your preferences by sending a letter, calling or e-mailing the IAPP Administrative Offices at the contact information below informing us of your preferences.

In connection with IAPP-hosted conferences, the IAPP provides an attendee list (the same list provided to attendees at the event) to the sponsors, co-sponsors and exhibitors.Â  The IAPP may also make available (through a third party mailing service) addresses for use by sponsors, co-sponsors and exhibitors in one pre- and one post-conference mailing. If you do not wish to receive the information from such sponsors, co-sponsors and exhibitors, you may express your preference to not be so contacted by either checking the appropriate box on the registration form at the time of registration or by sending a letter, calling or e-mailing the IAPP Administrative Offices at the contact information below informing us of your preference.

### Correspondence

If you correspond with us via e-mail, the postal service, or other form of communication, we may retain such correspondence and the information contained therein and use such to respond to your inquiry and/or notify you of IAPP conferences, news or other IAPP-related opportunities. Importantly, e-mail and postal address information is never sold, given, or otherwise shared or disclosed to third parties except as set forth herein. If you do not wish to receive such notifications, you may express your preference to not be so contacted by sending a letter, calling or e-mailing the IAPP Administrative Offices at the contact information below informing us of your preference.

### Information from Other Sources

We may receive information about you from other sources, such as our agents, vendors and service providers, and from publicly available sources. For example, sometimes we receive information from third parties when we process credit card payments made by you for conferences or membership.
