# IASbet.com - Privacy Policy

## We respect your privacy

We are committed to ensuring the privacy of everyone we deal with, and to providing you with the highest levels of customer service. From 21 December 2001, we are bound by new sections of the Commonwealth Privacy Act, 1988. International All Sports Limited has systems and processes in place that comply with the National Privacy Principles, which protect our customers and are the basis of the Act.

We collect personal information when we provide our services to you. This is collected in a number of ways including:

  * directly from you when you enter your personal details on our websites to open an account or update your details.  

  * from publicly available sources of information, including third parties from whom we may acquire lists.



We will tell you why we are collecting information when we collect it and how we plan to use it or these things will be obvious when we collect the information.

## Use of Information

We usually collect information from you to:

  * identify you and to assist you to obtain IAS products and services you require.  

  * administer and manage these services including opening and the ongoing settlement of your wagering account.  

  * conduct appropriate checks for credit worthiness and for fraud.  

  * conduct research and develop and improve our products and services.  

  * gain an understanding of your needs in order to provide you with better and more personalized products and services tailored to your requirements.

When we collect personal information from you we will provide you with the opportunity to indicate that you do not want this disclosed for marketing or secondary purposes. You can notify us at anytime at the Contact Us page to notify us of your requirements or preferences.

## Use by Third Parties

We may share your personal information with other Companies with whom we have a relationship within Australia or overseas. Some of these sites may be co-branded with our logo, however these sites are not operated or maintained on our behalf. These links are for the convenience of the user, however we cannot accept any responsibility for the content or practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our sites.

## Security

We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is stored securely. Transmissions sent to or from our websites are routinely monitored for quality control and systems administration. Unfortunately no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure, however we strive to protect your personal information to the maximum extent possible. We use a variety of physical and electronic methods including restricting access to offices, databases and firewalls to keep personal information secure from misuse, loss or unauthorized use. Credit card information is among the most important information we collect. IAS Limited operates secure servers, using high level encryption, to minimize the risk of unauthorized use of this type of information.

## Children’s Policy

We take our responsibilities seriously to protect children from the social impact of wagering until they are legally able to make such decisions. We will not accept their information for the purpose of opening a wagering account. It is however, ultimately the responsibility of parents to monitor their children’s Internet activities and, if desired, to use an appropriate screening software.

## Access to Personal Information

You have the right to access most personal information we hold about you and if we deny access in certain circumstances we will tell you why. If you would like to do so please let us know by sending an email to the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/contactus.aspx) page.
