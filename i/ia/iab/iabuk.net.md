The Internet Advertising Bureau (IAB) is committed to upholding your privacy as a valued user of this website. This privacy policy describes how the IAB collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website: [http://www.iabuk.net](http://www.iabuk.net/). We are also committed to offering you transparency and control over the personal information we hold about you as well as other data we may collect and use when you visit this website.

## Your Personal Information

When you visit this website we log your Internet Protocol (IP) address and use cookies to recognise your device when you return to our site. We also collect your personal information (name, email address, credit card information, etc) in order to register you for our events and seminars. We use this information to administer your account, send you newsletters, and respond to your questions and concerns. We’ll send you relevant emails to maintain the relationship between the IAB and you / your company or organisation. All our communications emails have a clear opt-out procedure included in these emails if you choose not to receive them.

The personal information we collect, process or use is treated securely and in accordance with this policy and data protection law. Whenever you give us this personal data, you are giving us permission to its collection and use in accordance with this policy. We will keep your personal information secure, accurate and up-to-date. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you become aware of any errors or if you would like to see what personal information we have collected from you, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, deactivate it by emailing our Customer Support at [info@iabuk.net](mailto:info@iabuk.net) or by contacting us by postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within 30 days. 

We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

 **The IAB will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this privacy policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties.**

From time to time we may wish to contact you with further information and events of other companies we think may interest you. Please email us on [info@iabuk.net](mailto:info@iabuk.net) if you do not wish this to happen. Each communication email will have a clear opt-out procedure as well.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.

We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request, and to any other third party with your prior consent to do so.

## Cookies

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a text-only string of data that is entered into the cookie file or “memory” of the web browser on your computer. It will typically contain the name of the domain from which the cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a value, usually a randomly generated unique number.

If you would like to know more about cookies please visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

 **How do we use cookies on this website?**

Using cookies is useful for us in optimising the website and making sure we are offering you the best content. We use cookies in order to give us information on the number of visitors to different parts of our website and thus to monitor which areas are most useful. We do not use them to identify you.

Our third party partners employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage content on our site. We do not tie the information gathered to our Customers’ or Users’ personal information.

If you decide to opt-out, advertisements may still be delivered to your web browser but those advertisements may not be as relevant to you because the advertisement request will only use information that is automatically transmitted through an Internet communication (e.g., web browser type, Internet Service Provider, information about the general content of the website or web page displayed on your web browser) and not information collected using an OpenX Cookie. Please note that if you delete the opt-out cookie, then you may receive the OpenX Cookie again. This cookie will automatically expire after one year.
