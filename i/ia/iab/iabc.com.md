If we ever ask for significantly different information we will inform you. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to “unsubscribe” to these mailings at any time.

### Overview and Background

Most organizations are in a period of transition today regarding how they manage and use email and related technologies. IABC has faced issues with online postings in the MemberSpeak area of its website for a number of years. In the past, when this area of the site was open to the public, there were problems with vulgar postings. The association’s solution was to move this benefit to the member-only portion of the website after a lengthy absence of the forum altogether. To address issues related to email usage, the board two years ago passed a policy concerning chapters’, districts’, regions’ and international’s publication of email addresses. That policy, however, did not deal with individual members’ use of email and website tools. Recent problems have highlighted the need to spell out unacceptable use of IABC Internet tools and the consequences for inappropriate behaviors.

### Examples of Inappropriate Use

During the past several years, the association has observed these types of inappropriate use of its website:

  * Posting messages that included vulgar, inappropriate, and misleading messages
  * Posting messages that could have been interpreted as official IABC messages



Other examples of inappropriate use that would be defined in a website usage policy are:

  * Posting messages that included vulgar, inappropriate, and misleading language.
  * Posting messages that could have been interpreted as official IABC messages.



Other examples of inappropriate use that would be defined in a website usage policy are:

  * Using Member Search to distribute unsolicited commercial e-mail (UCE), which is commonly known as “spam.”
  * Harvesting e-mail address or other contact information from www.iabc.com or any Chapter or Regional Web sites for purposes of distributing UCE.
  * Sending out any form of promotional communication to our members that implies endorsement by IABC, when no such endorsement exists.
  * Posting messages to any IABC online forum: (a) to promote products or services not endorsed by IABC; and (b) that are threatening, profane, or bigoted in nature.
  * Interfering with or “making mischief” via any present or future IABC online application.
  * Security breaches, including but not limited to, password theft, password sharing, and misrepresenting one’s identity via any present or future IABC online application.



### IABC’s Definition of UCE, a.k.a. “spam”

Because IABC is an association whose members depend on it for networking and support, our definition of UCE, a.k.a. “spam,” may differ from definitions used by commercial organizations. IABC defines UCE as unsolicited commercial email that is sent:

  * To recipients whom the sender does not know personally or with whom the sender does not have an Existing Business Relationship (an example of EBR: chapter leaders emailing their members, association members who provide services and who already have IABC members in their databases)
  * As a mass-marketing type of communication that is not explicitly requested.



### IABC Website User Conduct Policy

We respect and are committed to your privacy while online with IABC. At the same time, we recognize that as communicators and business people, you have a need to share information within the IABC networks. Sharing information is a major benefit of your IABC membership. This website User Conduct policy states our guidelines for site usage, so that all users can have a quality experience online with us.

  * You agree, as a user of our website, to abide by all applicable local, state, national and international laws and regulations in your use of the IABC website (“Service”), and agree not to interfere with the use and enjoyment of the Service by other users
  * You agree to be solely responsible for your actions and the contents of your transmissions through IABC. You agree not to impersonate any person or entity, including but not limited to, an IABC official, forum leader, guide or host or falsely state or otherwise misrepresent your affiliation with a person or entity
  * You agree not to use the Service to collect or harvest personal information about other users
  * You agree not to post, promote or transmit through the Service any unlawful, harassing, libelous, threatening, harmful, vulgar, hateful or otherwise objectionable material of any kind or nature
  * You agree not to advertise or offer to sell any goods or services, or engage in surveys, post or transmit “junk mail”, “spam” or unsolicited mass distribution of email.



IABC may, at its sole discretion, immediately terminate your access to the Service if your conduct fails to conform to these terms and conditions of the Terms. IABC may, but is not in any way obligated to, enforce these Terms against any user.

In order to protect the privacy of members, IABC’s website, www.iabc.com, will provide an “opt out” option allowing members to opt out of email communications. This may include email from IABC about IABC activities or from IABC about other organizations. email addresses for members who “opt out” may not be used for future email communications, based on the opt-out option they choose:

  1. Opt out of receiving all IABC information.
  2. Opt out only of receiving information about other organizations.
  3. Opt out of being listed in the online directory.



Members are encouraged to use www.iabc.com to register their opt-out requests in order to reduce the workload for chapters and regions. International will provide a means for chapter leaders to get up to date opt-in/out lists from the www.iabc.com site.

No IABC entity, including International, chapters or regions, is allowed to publish its members’ email addresses in printed directories or in a visible format on its website unless such a directory is 100% opt-in, meaning that no member is included in same until they have given the IABC entity explicit permission to do so.

IABC will provide blind links to members’ email addresses to facilitate networking, as currently provided on Member Search. Regions and chapters may do the same.

No IABC entity may sell, trade or give away to an outside organization member information that includes email addresses. Any IABC entity may send an email to its members on behalf of another organization, subject to the opt-out option #2 outlined above for third-party communications.

IABC chapters, districts or regions will communicate with their members by using the “email my chapter” feature, which will be available on the Chapter Management section of the website. By using this feature, chapter, district or regional leaders will be able to send emails that will appear to be addressed to only one recipient so that chapter-wide emails will not include email addresses of every member in the “to” field.

While we realize this policy won’t solve member problems with spamming from other organizations, it does ensure that IABC entities are not responsible for generating spam for members.
