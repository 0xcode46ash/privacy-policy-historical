**What are our user tracking and data capture practices?  
**

Our servers collect and aggregate user information site-wide, including anonymous site statistics, such as the number of views of each page. We log domain names and/or IP addresses of visitors (such as umich.edu, aol.com, 209.168.1.1, etc.), which permits us to know “where” visitors are from, or what access service they use, without knowing their individual identities. Because we do not require users to register with us, this “host level” tracking is our primary basis for assessing traffic patterns.

On certain pages, we give users the option of providing us with names, addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, email addresses, and other personal information, and various other kinds of details. This more personal information is gathered only with users` knowing and active permission and participation.

I AM ALPHA M LLC does not use any cookies that are automatically written to your computer’s hard drive or retained by I AM ALPHA M or our vendors. The I AM ALPHA M website does set “session specific cookies” to help run its interactive online applications, such as the shopping cart. The session specific cookies only exist in your computer’s short term memory (RAM) and only exist as long as the session lasts. They expire (disappear from your computer’s memory) when the session ends. These cookies will NOT be written to a user’s hard drive. Under no circumstance will any information associated with these cookies be retained or used by I AM ALPHA M or its vendors after the session is completed.

In addition, the third party email management provider that oversees the I AM ALPHA M’s newsletter distribution and data handling (see section below) will use cookies for the sole purpose of ensuring that an individual user can only access his/her personal profile and subscription information. This prevents a user from accessing or viewing another subscriber’s personal or subscription information. By contract with the I AM ALPHA M, the vendor will not transfer or sell any information that it collects from users of the I AM ALPHA M Website to a third party.

On some pages, users can sign up to receive additional information by e-mail through an e-mail subscription service (as discussed below), or by other means, including postal mail. Personal information that has been volunteered to us may also be combined with data from third parties, such as Congressional district maps, to improve our services to members. No such combining will be done for marketing purposes.

E-mail addresses of visitors and members are never exchanged with other organizations except as provided for in the section on email list subscriptions below.

**What about those third party links?**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

**How do we protect your information?**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to?keep the information confidential.
