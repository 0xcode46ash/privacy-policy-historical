### Information we collect and store automatically

The INL collects and stores the following information automatically:

  * Date and time you accessed our site.
  * Pages you visit.
  * Internet address of the web site from which you came to our site.

We use summary statistics to help us make our site more useful, such as assessing what information is of most and least interest to visitors, and for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas. 

Parts of our site use cookies to improve your experience. A cookie contains information that is either stored in your computer’s memory, or in a file on your computer’s hard disk. Cookies that are stored in your computer’s memory are automatically removed when you quit your browser. Cookies that are stored in a file on your computer’s hard disk will have an expiration date after which time they will no longer be valid. It is our policy to notify you and obtain your approval before a cookie is stored on your computer, to explain what the cookie collects, and how the information is used. If you encounter a cookie that does not terminate upon ending a session at an inel.gov web site — without your approving of it’s use and there is no explanation or the explanation is not clear or reasonable — please [let us know](https://web.archive.org/cgi-bin/www/email/print_form.pl?id=4&name=^Feedback&template=inl).
