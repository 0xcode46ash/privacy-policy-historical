#### Information Collection and Use

We may collect information to provide and improve our Site, services, features and content, to administer your use of the Site and to enable users to easily navigate the Site.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

When you register with us through the Site and become a Member and when you choose to post a Listing or book an Advertising Services, or when you wish to contact another Member, we will ask you for personally identifiable information. This refers to information about you that can be used to contact or identify you ("Identity Information"). Identity Information includes, but is not limited to, your name, phone number and email address, but does not include your credit card number or billing information. In order to process some of your transactions through the Site, we may also ask for your credit card number and other billing information ("Billing Information") (Identity Information and Billing Information together, "Personal Information"). If the address of a Listing you post matches that of your credit card billing address, that address would be considered Identity Information. Some Personal Information is required, like your name and email address, and other Personal Information is optional, like your date of birth. We reserve the right to require address confirmation for Inventory included in Listings. If we require such confirmation, we will send a code via postal mail to the address contained in a Listing and ask you to enter the code via the Site and Service in order to confirm the address of the Booking included in the applicable Listing. We use your Personal Information to provide the Service and administer your inquiries.

We collect Personal Information in connection with your registration to join the Service. You can register to join via the Site by completing the required forms.

You can also register to join by logging into online accounts you may have with third party service providers ("SNS")(e.g. Facebook); each such account, a "Third Party Account", via our Site as described below. As part of the functionality of the Site, Service, you may link your Influads Account with Third Party Accounts, by either: (i) providing your Third Party Account login information to Influads through the Site, Service; or (ii) allowing Influads to access your Third Party Account, as is permitted under the applicable terms and conditions that govern your use of each Third Party Account. You represent that you are entitled to disclose your Third Party Account login information to Influads and/or grant Influads access to your Third Party Account (including, but not limited to, for use for the purposes described herein), without breach by you of any of the terms and conditions that govern your use of the applicable Third Party Account and without obligating Influads to pay any fees or making Influads subject to any usage limitations imposed by the applicable SNS. If you decide to register by logging into a Third Party Account via our Site, we will obtain the Personal Information you have provided to the applicable SNS (such as your "real" name, email address, profile picture, names of SNS friends, names of SNS groups to which you belong, other information you make publicly available via the applicable SNS and/or other information you authorize Influads to access by authorizing the SNS to provide such information) from your Third Party Accounts and use that information to create your Influads Account and Influads Account profile page and you will become a Member. Depending on the Third Party Accounts you choose and subject to the privacy settings that you have set in such Third Party Accounts, you understand that by granting us access to the Third Party Accounts, we will access, make available and store (if applicable and as permitted by the SNS and authorized by you) the information in your Third Party Accounts so that it is available on and through your Influads Account on the Site, Service. If there is information about your "friends" or people with whom you are associated in your Third Party Account, the information we obtain about those "friends" or people with whom you are associated, may also depend on the privacy settings such people have with the applicable SNS.

We also collect the other information that you provide as part of registration and the administration and personalization of your Influads Account profile (e.g., without limitation, zip code (on its own) and individual preferences or demographic information) ("Non-Identifying Information").

We use your Personal Information (in some cases, in conjunction with your Non-Identifying Information) mainly to provide the Service, complete your transactions, and administer your inquiries.

Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your demographic information). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from other Influads Users (defined below) to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the Service and to analyze and understand how our Site and Service are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions.

We also use your Personal Information to contact you with Influads newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive such communications from us, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided in any of the communications or update your "Notifications" information. (See "Changing or Deleting Information," below.) Please note that we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with information related to your use of the Service; you may not opt out of these notifications.

#### Log Data

When you visit the Site, whether as a Member or a non-registered user just browsing (any of these, an "Influads User"), our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type or the webpage you were visiting before you came to our Site, pages of our Site that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on our Site, access times and dates, and other statistics. We use this information to monitor and analyze use of the Site and the Service and for the Site’s technical administration, to increase our Site’s functionality and user-friendliness, and to better tailor our Site to our visitors' needs. We also use this information to verify that visitors to the Site meet the criteria required to process their requests. We do not treat Log Data as Personal Information or use it in association with other Personal Information, though we may aggregate, analyze and evaluate such information for the same purposes as stated above regarding other Non-Identifying Information.

#### Web Beacons

Our Site may contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our Site and are used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

#### Emailing Via an Influads Account

As part of the Service, Influads Users may communicate with Influads Members through use of the "Contact Publisher" feature on the Site. Where Influads Users have selected the option of adding one or more email addresses to an online form, the message they create in the corresponding template will be sent from Influads to those email addresses on their behalf. These email addresses will be used only for the purpose of sending the email communication to the addressee. Via the "Contact Publisher" feature of the Site, you may also speak with other Influads Members over the phone. In these instances, Influads will not share your phone number with the other Influads Member, but will use your phone number to contact you over the phone to connect you with the other Influads Member.

If you choose to use our referral service to ask a friend for a recommendation, we will ask you for your friend’s email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Influads stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.

Your friends may contact us to request that we remove this information from our database.

You can import contacts from your email account address book to invite them to send you a recommendation. We collect, but do not store, the username and password for the email account you wish to import your contacts from and will only use it for that purpose only.

#### Phishing

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Influads. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your Influads Account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing, visit the Federal Trade Commission's website at[ http://www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/).

#### Information Sharing and Disclosure

The Site and Service can be used to facilitate the listing and booking of Accommodations. Listings for such Inventory are made available via the Site and Service by Publishers. Listings posted by Publishers, ratings and reviews of Publishers and Advertisers, and the Profile Information (as defined below) of Publishers and Advertisers, are visible to any Influads User.

**Influads Members and Users**

When you create an Influads Account, we will set up an Influads Account profile page for you. Your Influads Account profile page will include your first name and last initial.

We will display your Profile Information in your Influads Account profile page publicly via the Site, and, with your prior permission, on third party sites. Any information you choose to provide as part of your Profile Information will be publicly visible to all Influads Users and consequently should reflect how much you want other Influads Users to know about you. We recommend that you guard your anonymity and sensitive information and we encourage members to think carefully about what information about themselves they disclose in their profile pages. You can review and revise your Profile Information at any time.

#### Listings

If you post a Listing, we may publish that Listing publicly via the Site and may enable third parties to publish your Listing on their websites through the use of an HTML "widget". We may also display the geographical location of your Listing in the form of a map so that potential Advertisers can see the general area and neighborhood of your Listing, but your actual street address will not be disclosed until you enter into a confirmed transaction with another Member.

If you request to make a booking via the Site and Service, Influads will share some information about you with the applicable Publisher. All of this information will enable the Publisher to decide whether to confirm or reject your booking. When a Publisher confirms a booking we will share pieces of the Publisher’s Identify Information, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number, address and the Publisher’s email address, with the applicable Advertiser selected by the Publisher and we will share pieces of the Advertiser’s Identify Information with the Publisher, including, but not limited to, full name, phone number and email address, so that the Advertiser and Publisher may contact one another directly. In no event is a Advertiser's Billing Information shared with a Publisher.

#### Aggregate Information and Non-Identifying Information

Any aggregated information shared in these contexts will not contain your Personal Information.

We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Site-related services (e.g., without limitation, maintenance services, database management, web analytics, fraud detection services relating to the activity of Influads Users and improvement of the Site’s features) or to assist us in analyzing how our Site and Service are used.

When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored "personal data" (as defined in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Site in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, insofar as consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.

If you choose to visit an advertiser by "clicking on" a banner ad or other type of advertisement, or click on another third party link, you will be directed to that third party's website. The fact that we link to a website or present a banner ad or other type of advertisement is not an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party, nor is it an endorsement of their privacy or information security policies or practices. We do not exercise control over third party websites. These other websites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you.
