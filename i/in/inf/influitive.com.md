While Influitive’s website or other materials may include links or references to non-Influitive websites, materials, or entities, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those non-Influitive sites, materials, or entities unless otherwise indicated.

**Your Consent**

You should read this entire Privacy Policy before submitting information to Influitive or using Influitive’s website or application. We collect, use and disclose your personal data with your permission, for the purposes we have identified below, or as allowed or required by law. Whenever you submit information via Influitive’s website, application or otherwise to Influitive, whether online or offline, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Personal Information Collection and Use**

We collect personal information about our customers both online and offline. In most cases, such information will be collected directly from you through your communication, interactions and activities with us. We may also collect information from third-party sources (including without limitation, publically available data, other companies and referrals).

Personal information collected may include but is not limited to the following:

Contact Information, including your name, company name, title, email address and telephone number.

User Content, including information provided when you use any online mean of communications with us and all user submissions and content you provide.

Transaction Information, including products or services you inquire about.

Other data to help us categorize your questions, diagnose issues using our application and product and services, and respond to your cases when you contact Influitive’s support center.

Please note that it is always your choice whether to provide any personal information. We will use information you provide us to respond to your requests, to contact you, to provide information about Influitive’s products, services and opportunities, to respond to our customers’ inquiries, and to review your application if you have responded to a job opening. We may also use the information you provide us to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices and marketing promotion. You may withdraw your permission for us to collect, use and disclose your personal data at any time, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. However, without your permission we may not be able to respond to your queries or process your requests.

If we plan to use your personal data in future for any purposes other than those identified above or those specifically identified in the relevant email form, we will only do so after informing you by updating this Privacy Policy.

**Security & Disclosures**

We use commercially reasonable efforts to store and maintain all personal data in a secure environment on our systems and except to comply with legal and regulatory requests or requirements. We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose personal data you provide to our affiliates and partners and to consultants, service providers, and contractors that we use to support our business and operations (e.g. technical support, advertising, public relations, media and marketing services, legal services, e-commerce and other web-related services such as web hosting and web monitoring services, and event-related services such as online and offline data capture services) who have agreed to keep the information confidential and use it only to provide the applicable service(s).

We may also disclose personal data to third parties (including without limitation, governmental agencies) if required to do so by law, regulation, or court order; to respond to governmental and/or law enforcement requests; to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with our (or others’) rights or property; to support any claim, defense, or declaration in a case or before any jurisdictional and/or administrative authority, arbitration, or mediation panel; or in connection with disciplinary actions/investigations. Likewise, we may disclose personal data to third parties in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of Influitive, its business or the website to which such data applies. In the event that Influitive goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale of a portion of its assets, our customers’ personal data may be part of the assets transferred. Customers will be notified via prominent notice on our website prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal data. If, as a result of the business transaction, your personal data will be used in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, you will be notified consistent with our Privacy Policy.
