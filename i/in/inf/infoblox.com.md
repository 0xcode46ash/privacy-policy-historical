As part of this use of information, we may also provide aggregate information to our partners about how our customers generally use our site.

This data regarding services helps us determine how effective support service is, so we can improve our self-service tools and make them as effective as possible. Data relating to products helps us asses the usage patterns and reliability of our product platforms, and may be used to help us in our continuing efforts to develop more efficient, reliable products.

### E-mail Communications:

We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Infoblox if your computer supports this type of program. Infoblox may use this confirmation to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We may also compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to avoid sending duplicate or unnecessary messages to our customers. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at [mailing@infoblox.com](mailto:mailing@infoblox.com) and include sufficient information for us to identify your account.
