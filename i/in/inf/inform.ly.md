# Security and privacy » Informly - Informly

[](http://inform.ly/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/OAuth-Logo.png?86e834 "OAuth-Logo")

Oauth is the security protocol used by companies like Microsoft, Facebook and Google.

At Informly we are serious about privacy and security. Here are some of the things we have in place:

  1. No passwords necessary for accessing information from your sources
  2. SSL encryption across the entire application
  3. Limited data saved on our databases
  4. We don’t provide your information to anyone



Here is some more information on how we manage security and privacy.

## No passwords necessary

Thanks to the secure connections provided by our partners (called oAuth), Informly users generally don’t have to enter passwords for us to be able to report on their data.

This is how it works:

**Step 1 –  Authorise Informly to access the service. **

When you click on a service in the add chart pop up you will be prompted to Authorize that source).

**Step 2 – Login to the service and give permission**

Some sources will just require you log in and in the process they will give Informly permission to access your data (see MailChimp example below). Others will make you log in and then click on another Authorize button to confirm.

This gives us an access token that only we can use to access the information we need to generate our reports.

## SSL encryption across the entire application

The whole application runs on an SSL encrypted connection (https). This ensures that any information you enter into the app is encrypted and can’t be viewed by 3rd parties.

While our users don’t enter much information into the app we still believe it’s best to have peace of mind.

## Limited data in our database

You might think because we can report on so much information that our databases must be stacked full of your information. This isn’t the case. We simply connect to your services and only retrieve what we need for our reports – nothing else – generally just raw numbers that we use in the charts.

## Email reports

If you turn email reports on, they use images of your data embedded into HTML emails. These images are saved on our server and publicly available to anyone who knows their address. The address is created with random characters that is impossible to predict much like a password.

## Privacy policy
