# Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

It is our policy to provide you with the best possible service without infringing on your privacy. 

_Personal Information_

We only ask for personal information when you wish to purchase from us, or make use of services such as email alerting or saved marked lists.   
We may use the information that you provide or that we collect for the following purposes: 

  * to administer our website services; 
  * to provide any services or information you have requested; 
  * to ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer; 
  * for detecting and protecting against error fraud or other criminal activity; 
  * to enforce our terms and conditions of use; or 
  * in any other way as described to you at the time of collection of your Personal Information. 



Your email address will be used to notify you of essential service information, and any alerts you have requested. You may also, from time to time, receive information on services and offers available to you from Informa or one of our partners. If you do not wish to receive these emails you can state this preference at the point of registration, or at any future point by altering the preferences in _My Account_. 

When users submit sensitive information via the website (such as a credit card number), their information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. 

While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, as will be the case for most of the time that a user is browsing the web. 

We may give information about you to the following, who may use it for the same purposes as set out above: 

  * to our agents and employees to administer any accounts, products and services provided to you now or in the future; 
  * to agents who profile your data so that we may tailor the goods/services we offer to your specific needs; 
  * to anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under our agreement with you; 
  * if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to do so. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction; 
  * to third parties who will help process your order.
