We collect Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") from the Site when you choose to provide it to us. PII is any information that can be used to identify or locate a particular person or entity. This includes, but is not limited to: name, postal address, telephone number, or email address. For example, you may choose to send us PII about yourself in an email or by completing an online form on this Site. We use this information only to contact you to respond to your inquiry. Once collected, we will store your PII for a reasonable time for record keeping purposes. The information that we store is usually deleted as space requires or in the normal course of business.

We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) via the Site. Non-PII cannot be used to contact any single person or entity and may include your IP address, pages viewed on this Site, browser type, Internet Service Provider, the time/date of your visit to this Site, and your computer's operating system (e.g., Mac OSX). Inform uses this information for internal purposes such as to administer the Site, improve and customize the Site, help Inform understand and analyze how the Site is being used and to track aggregate Site usage.

### Cookies and Web Beacons

We use "cookies" and web beacons to help us manage this Site. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

### What information is collected?

Inform does not collect PII. We do collect and use Non-PII, including: the IP address used to access the Internet, the type of browser used, which and how many publisher web pages have been viewed, the date and time an ad was requested, and how many ads were requested. We retain the Non-PII collected via our Websites in order to ensure that our sites are functioning properly.

### Cookies

Inform's Technology stores a "cookie" on your computer hard drive with Non-PII that it uses to keep track of the content you have viewed on our Websites. Cookies are small text files that contain a string of alphanumeric characters. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt you before accepting a cookie from the Websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the Websites you visit.

### Third Party Links and Websites

**Opting out:** Inform is in the process of implementing a program that will allow you to opt-out from having Inform collect your Non-PII in connection with our websites. The opt-out process will place an opt-out cookie on your computer. The opt-out cookie tells us not to collect your Non-PII and to avoid writing another cookie to your computer. Please note that if you delete, block or otherwise restrict cookies, or if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choice.

Our opt-out program is scheduled to launch in July 2009. If you would like us to notify you when our opt-out program is available, please contact us [via email](mailto:information@inform.com).

### Information Security

The security of your information is important to us. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about our security practices, please send an email to us [via email](mailto:information@inform.com).

### Information Relating to Children

Our products and services are designed for those 18 years of age and older. We do not knowingly collect PII from anyone under the age of 18. If we are made aware that we have received PII from someone under 18, we will use reasonable efforts to remove that information from our records.

### Disclosure of Information to Third Parties

We do not collect PII via our Technology, and we do not sell, rent or share PII collected on the Site with non-affiliated third parties without your consent.

We may share Non-PII collected via our Technology with publishers and partners. Similarly, we may enhance the Non-PII collected via our Technology with Non-PII collected from publishers and partners. This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually.

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII collected via the Site, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
