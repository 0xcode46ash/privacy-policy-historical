#### Praise for Infinite Skills

Thank you for the tracking information! I am very impressed with the speed and quality of Infinite Skills' customer service! This is the first time I have placed an order with your company. I ordered a Windows Vista training DVD for my dad on Thanksgiving day. Within 15 minutes of placing the web order I received a phone call from the company stating that a physical address was needed for UPS shipping (instead of a PO Box). I said, "Wow! That was quick!" My dad had mentioned "Video Professor" products for computer training. After reading the fine print for Video Professor products, I chose the Infinite Skills' Windows Vista DVD instead. Thanks again! Rebecca
