#### Praise for O'Reilly

Thank you Support, As a SolidWorks Instructor I keep up my own skills and I learn how other instructors teach the basic course and some of the add ons that can also be taught. I learn only to teach. I am retired but realize the importance of passing on whatever I have learned to those that have a long way to go. Great tutorials done by real professionals.
