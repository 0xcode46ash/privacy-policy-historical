#### Praise for Infinite Skills

[Apple OS X Lion Server] I had to learn OS X Lion Server over a weekend before I went on a deployment course for work, as knowledge of this was a pre-requisite. Having previous experience with Snow Leopard and Leopard server, I didn't have time to read the book, so watched the videos from this course. Everything was clear and concise and gave me all the knowledge I needed, not only for the deployment course, but to use this at work right away. Ian B.
