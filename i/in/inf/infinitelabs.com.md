Site. We do not control those third party sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from
our practices. We do not endorse or make any representations about third‐party sites. The
personal data you choose to provide to them or that is collected by these third parties is not

send you unsolicited messages, or for purposes that neither you nor we have control over. We
are not responsible for the personal information you choose to submit in these forums.
In addition to the information you provide, we may also collect information during your visit to
our Site, or a website “powered by” another company on behalf of us, through our Automatic
Data Collection Tools, which include Web beacons, cookies, and embedded Web links. These
tools collect certain traffic information that your browser sends to a website, such as your
browser type and language, access times, and the address of the website from which you
arrived. They may also collect information about your Internet Protocol (IP) address, unique
device identifier, clickstream behavior (i.e. the pages you view, the links you click, and other
actions you take in connection with our Sites or “powered by” websites) and product
information. We may also use some of these Automatic Data Collection Tools in connection
with certain emails and communications sent from us and therefore may collect information
using these tools when you open the email or click on a link contained in the email.
We may also collect information from commercially available sources. Such information may
include your name, address, email address, preferences, interests, and demographic/profile
data. The information we collect from its commercial sources may be used along with the
information we collect when you visit our sites. For example, we may compare the geographic
information acquired from commercial sources with the IP address collected by Automatic Data
Collection Tools to derive your general geographic area.
3. How we use your information
The information we collect to understand your needs and interests help us deliver a consistent
and personalized experience. For example, we may use your information to: assist you in
completing a transaction or order; prevent and detect security threats, fraud or other malicious
activity; communicate with you about products and services; provide and improve service and
support; update you on new services and benefits; provide personalized promotional offers;
                                                                                                 2

you to participate in contests and surveys and contact you regarding our products or services.
We will give you the opportunity to choose your privacy preferences regarding the
communications we send. The testimonials posted on our Web site are only posted with the
express permission of the individual or company who provided that testimonial.
Credit card information is used only for payment processing and fraud prevention. Credit card
information and other sensitive personal information required to process a credit decision is
not used for any other purpose by our financial services providers or us and will not be kept
longer than necessary for providing the services, unless you ask us to retain your credit card
information for future purchases.
4. How we share your information
We will not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others except as described in this
Online Privacy Statement. We share personal information in the following ways:
We retain service providers and suppliers to deliver complete products, services and customer
solutions and to assist us with marketing and communication initiatives. These providers and
suppliers include, for example, credit card processors, providers of customer support and live‐
help, marketing, email service providers, automated data processors, and shipping agents.
Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information
received on behalf of us and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services
they are performing for us.
From time to time, we participate in marketing initiatives with other companies, including
websites “powered by” another company on behalf of us. As part of these initiatives, certain of
our services and marketing communications may be delivered at the same time as those from
other companies. Some of these services and communications offer you the option to share
personal information with both us and the other companies participating in these initiatives. If
you choose to provide personal information only to us, we will not share this information with
the other companies participating in that marketing initiative. If you choose to provide personal
information to the other companies, that personal information will be handled according to the
privacy policy of those companies, which may differ from our policies and practices.
 [What is this paragraph trying to say? ]Except as described in this Online Privacy Statement, we
will not share the personal information you provide to us with non‐INFINITE LABS® third parties
without your permission, unless to: (i) respond to duly authorized information requests of
police and governmental authorities; (ii) comply with any law, regulation, subpoena, or court
order; (iii) investigate and help prevent security threats, fraud or other malicious activity; (iv)
enforce/protect our rights and properties or those of our subsidiaries; or (v) protect the rights
or personal safety of our employees and third parties on or using our property.

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, we decide to
sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may
involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the
receipt of it from sellers. It is our practice to seek appropriate protection for information in
these types of transactions.
5. Children's privacy
We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 and we do not
target our Site to children under 13. We encourage parents and guardians to take an active role
in their children’s online and mobile activities and interests.
6. Subscription Communications
Subscription communications include email newsletters, updates, etc. that may be expressly
requested by you or which you consent to receive. After you request such communications, you
may opt‐out of receiving them by using one of the following methods: you may call us at
1.877.485.2271 or contact us at: 7208 W. Sand Lake Rd., Orlando, FL 32819, USA. You should be
aware, however, that it is not always possible to completely remove or modify information in
our databases and servers, although we will always make reasonable efforts to do so upon your
request, and we are unable to have your information removed from the records of any third
party who has been provided with your information in accordance with this policy.
7. Access to and accuracy of your information
We strive to keep your personal information accurately recorded. We have implemented
technology, management processes, and policies to help maintain data accuracy. We provide
individuals with reasonable access to personal information that they provided to us and the
reasonable ability to review and correct it or ask for anonymization, blockage, or deletion, as
applicable. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify
your identity, such as requiring a password and user ID, before granting access to your data. To
view and change the personal information that you directly provided to us you can please call
us at 1.877.485.2271 or contact us at: 7208 W. Sand Lake Rd., Orlando, FL 32819, USA.
8. Keeping your personal information secure
We take seriously the trust you place in us. We exercise reasonable care to prevent
unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate
use of the information. However, we cannot guaranty that our measures will completely bar
unauthorized access to your information, and by using the Sites you assume this risk.
                                                                                                 4


9. We Use Automatic Data Collection Tools
We collect non‐personal identification information through the use of, without limitation, the
following types of methodology:
"Cookie" technology: A "cookie" is an element of data that a website can send to your browser,
which may then store it on your system.
"IP address tracking": An "IP address" is a number that is assigned to your computer when you
are on the Internet. When you request pages from our Sites, our servers log your IP address.
"Web beacons": A "Web beacon," or "clear gif," is a small graphic image on a webpage or web‐
based document that a website can use to determine information about a user.
Non‐personal identification information might include the browser you use, the type of
computer, technical information about your means of connection to our Sites such as the
operating systems and the Internet service providers utilized, and other similar information.
Our systems may also automatically gather information about the areas you visit and search
terms you utilize on our Sites and about the links you may select from within our Sites to other
areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online.
We use such information for our business purposes, and, in particular, to administer the Sites,
better manage advertising on the Sites, and, in the aggregate, to understand how our users as a
group use the services, features and other resources provided on our Sites. This way we know
which areas of our Sites are favorites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what
technologies are being used so that we may continually improve our Sites.
We may share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third
parties, but we will not share any individual names, personal navigational or other personal
information. For example, we may use a third‐party advertising company to serve ads when you
visit our Sites. We may share demographic and preference information with this company to
allow them to display appropriate advertisements for you.
We use a proprietary advertising server to display ads on our Sites. In addition, advertisers may
elect to use third‐party advertising companies to place ads onto our Sites. Some of our
advertisers may display ads on our Sites that may use cookie technology or Web beacons to (i)
identify non‐personal information about our users (such as connection speed, browser and
country of origin) and (ii) track user behavior within our Sites. Advertisers generally use such
information to customize the display of ads. We will not permit such advertisers to collect any
personal information from our users within our Sites; however, you may choose to voluntarily
provide the advertisers with your personal information. We do not have access to these cookies
or any information that they may contain.
                                                                                                 5


Further, from time‐to‐time we contract with a third party web analytics provider to help
manage and optimize our Sites. We use this service to help us measure the effectiveness of our
advertising and how visitors use our Sites. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookie
technology on the Sites. The type of information we collect includes such information as the
number of hits a webpage receives, type of browser used, and number of times a visitor makes
a purchase from a particular promotion. Although this third‐party provider logs the information
coming from our Sites on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used.
10. Your Acceptance of These Terms
By using any of the Sites, you signify your acceptance of our Online Privacy Statement, and that
you understand the scope and limitations of the protections provided under this Online Privacy
Statement. . If you do not agree to these policies, please do not use our Sites. Your continued
use of the Sites following the posting of changes to our Online Privacy Statement will mean that
you accept those changes.
Our Site is operated in the United States. If you are in the European Union or elsewhere, please
note that the personal information you provide will be transferred to the United States for use
by us for the purposes described above. By using our Sites, registering for an account or service,
or otherwise providing us with your personal information, you consent to this transfer of your
personal information.
