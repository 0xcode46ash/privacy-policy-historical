Sometimes we require information that personally identifies you and/or your company, providing us with the means to contact you directly. Generally, this information is only necessary when you are submitting a request for quotation, placing an order online, or when applying for a seminar or program.

Your personal information will be used to process online requests and to establish any necessary communications with you via email, phone, or fax. Any form of casual communication that is considered a nuisance will be suspended, per your request.

We will never sell or misuse the information you provide in any way. Sometimes this information will be shared with other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including the mailing and delivering of products and catalogs. In these cases, we will provide only that information which is necessary for the service to be completed.

### Guaranteed Security of Your Information

Your personal information is never shared outside of our company without your expressed permission, except under the conditions explained above. When you submit any type of sensitive data online (i.e. - Credit card information), it is encrypted and passed along to our company through a _secure socket layer_ \-- the e-commerce encryption standard that is guaranteed to keep your data safe. Internally, your information is stored on IV's password-controlled remote server with guarded user access.

We do everything in our power to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
