In the process of operating INO.com, we collect personal information via order forms, feedback forms, on-line surveys, unsolicited e-mails and other communications. We also gather general information about site usage, including statistics for hits, unique visits, repeat visits and page views. 

The total information we receive enables INO.com to make improvements to the site for the benefit of all users, and also keeps advertisers and potential advertisers informed about overall demographic trends on the site. Advertisers are never provided with individual preferences or contact information unless users grant their permission beforehand. 

Personal information tendered to INO.com is used for a number of reasons, including 1) The fulfillment of orders, 2) the fulfillment of subscriptions, 3) registration for INO conferences, 4) delivery of customer-requested e-mail services, and 5) design and maintenance of INO.com's custom portfolio services. 

Where custom portfolio services are concerned, the use of cookies may also be used to facilitate the login process. Please note that nothing in a cookie allows anyone to identify you individually. 

With e-mail, we will only add you to one of our e-mail lists if you have requested it. In addition, all of INO.com's e-mail services are accompanied by a simple-to-use facility for unsubscribing. Another feature underlining our approach to privacy is our policy of excluding e-mail addresses from messages posted in our discussion center, The INO Forum.
