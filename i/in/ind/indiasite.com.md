| The banner management system only records view and click counts apart from a users' browser type and operating system. Absolutely no other information is recorded in the database.

| Although we take precautions to keep our information private, IndiaSite.com is hosted on a network shared by other websites/users as well. It is therefore not possible to guarantee that other users on the server cannot access the information contained in our directories although we have taken several security precautions to prevent unauthorized access to information files.
