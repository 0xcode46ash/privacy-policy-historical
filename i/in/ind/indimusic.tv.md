# Privacy Policy

Your Information Stays With Us At Indimusic.tv, we value your privacy. You trust us and our members and sponsors and we take this responsibility very seriously. Our privacy policy is simple: Indimusic.tv and its affiliates respect your right to confidentiality and do not share your personally identifiable information unless it is at your request to receive information or provide a service, with your authorization, or as permitted by law. Even in that case, when you submit information to Indimusic.tv, you authorize us to share this information only with the qualified network of Indimusic.tv sponsors. Accordingly, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure that your personally identifiable information remains private. Indimusic.tv may notify you of special promotions offered by the program sponsors and underwriters in our network or related service providers. No personal information about you will be supplied to the promotion sponsors unless you express an interest in the offer by e-mail, our opt-in service during registration or by phone. You have the option to decline such offers and be removed from e-mail promotion lists at any time. To make this request, please contact us in writing: IMTV email: info@indimusictv.com Or you can log into your account and change preferences. You may simply "opt out" (the link is at the bottom of every page on this site and included with any email promotions) as well which will remove you from all email lists. However, you must maintain your account to vote in the IndiMusic TV video voting process.
