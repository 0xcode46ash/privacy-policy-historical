# IndiaPlaza.com COMPLETE INDIAN SHOPPING

IndiaPlaza.com shares your concerns over how information about you is used, and we appreciate your trust to use your information carefully. We've posted this notice to explain our privacy policy. By visiting IndiaPlaza.com, you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Notice. 

**What Personal Information About Me Does IndiaPlaza.com Use?**

Any information we learn from our customers about helps us only to serve them better and improve their shopping experience on our site. Any information you enter on our Web site or give to us in any other way is stored securely on our servers. You may always choose not to provide certain information, but in doing so, you may deny yourself the ability to use the site or use certain features. In most cases, we use the information customers provide for such purposes as assisting with order processing, responding to your customer queries, customizing emails and shopping for customers, and simply communicating. 

In truth, due to our careful security measures, we receive certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Many websites, for example, use "cookies," and we do as well. These are used to recognize when you return to IndiaPlaza.com through your browser and to follow your movements through the site to better help us in making a site that you will enjoy using. You may find some companies that offer utilities that allow you to visit sites anonymously. You are welcome to use such programs while at IndiaPlaza.com, of course, though they will impede us from personalizing your experience on our site and may make it impossible for you to sign in and use your account. 

We also generally receive a confirmation when you open e-mail from IndiaPlaza.com, though only if your computer and service provider supports such capabilities. This way, we know if, for instance, if you've received an answer to a question you may have asked, or notifications about an order you may have placed. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please change your Preferences within your account. Occasionally via email, we provide a product recommendation or special offer that we believe will interest you. Every email of this type is carefully reviewed by our staff for quality and value, as, frankly, we dislike getting "junk" email as much as anyone. Any offers you receive from us will have met specific standards and may, of course, be ignored, but we hope you find them as valuable as we do. 

**How Secure Is The Information IndiaPlaza.com Has About Me?**

We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software during any order transmission to encrypt valuable information customers input. Your account password is also protected, as we know how important it is to allow only authorized access to your account. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer and never give your password to anyone you aren't sure you can trust. 

**How Much Does IndiaPlaza.com Share the Information About Me That it Receives?**

This is the privacy question we are asked most often. We know how important information about our customers is in our business, both to you and us, as well as other companies. Despite the financial advantages that might be had, however, we are not in the business of selling your information to others. Any emails you receive from us are sent by us and carefully approved by our staff. As a subsidiary of Sify.com, we sometimes do share customer information only with our parent company, and then never for later sale or use by some other company. 

We do work closely with a number of affiliated businesses, and we sometimes allow them to make offers in conjunction with IndiaPlaza.com. In these cases, however, they never see your information. All emails sponsored by an affiliate company are sent by IndiaPlaza.com and all information pertaining to those customers receiving that email is kept secure by us as well. 

If you've ordered from us already, you may know that, naturally, we must use other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. These functions include delivering packages, sending postal mail, processing credit card payments, etc. As a result, businesses such as shipping companies and credit card companies may have access to certain personal information needed to perform their functions. But these companies are under obligation not to use that information for any other purpose. By law, we sometimes must release account and other personal information when we believe release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Conditions of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IndiaPlaza.com, our users, or others. This may include exchanging information with State or Federal officials, as well as other companies and organizations to increase fraud protection and credit risk reduction. This is for our customers' own good and protects all of us. 

**Does IndiaPlaza.com Sell to Children?**

IndiaPlaza.com does not sell products for purchase by children or anyone under the age of 18. Our contest and promotions, furthermore, are eligible for entry only by customers 21 and over. We may sell some products meant for use by children, but these are only meant for purchase by adults. If you are under 18, you may use IndiaPlaza.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. 

**Conclusion:**

Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to a third party, and you have an opportunity to choose not to share that information. Remember that you can change or update certain personal information on pages in the Your Account section, as mentioned above. When you update information, we sometimes do keep a copy of the prior information for our records. 

Remember that this Privacy Policy governs your use of IndiaPlaza.com, as well as our use of your information. It is your responsibility to review this Policy for changes, as well as your own account. If you choose to visit IndiaPlaza.com, your visit and any dispute over privacy is subject to this Policy and our terms of usage as outlined throughout this site. This includes shipping and return policies, damage limitations, disputes, and the laws of the state of California. Please check our site frequently to see any changes to this or other policies.
