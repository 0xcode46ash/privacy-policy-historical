When you visit India.com, we collect some basic information about your computer, such as:   
IP address (the numeric code allotted by your Internet Service Provider)   
Operating system (e.g., Windows 95)   
Browser software (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape)   
Internet Service Provider (e.g., Earthlink, Bell Atlantic, VSNL, Mantra Online, Satyam)   
Other numeric codes used to identify a computer 

The information we collect is aggregated to reflect the population as a whole rather than focused on individuals. We use it to help us better understand the people who visit India.com. In addition, like many other sites with paid advertising, we disclose some of this aggregate information to advertisers to inform them of the number of people who have seen and clicked on their advertisements.

3.What personal information does India.com collect about me and how is it used?   
Personal information is collected by specifically requesting it from you. This occurs during the India.com signup (registration) process, when you request a service, provide feedback in an online survey, enter an online contest or sweepstakes, request email notification of your order status, or subscribe to a newsletter or a mailing list. We ask you to supply personal information, including your first name, last name, address, birth date and an alternate e-mail address. We also ask if you would like to receive promotional material from our sponsors and great offers from our partners. 

India.com and their necessary service partners use your personal identifying information to deliver services and inform you of other products or services available from India.com and its business partners. India.com may also use your personal identifying information to allow other companies to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you ("Secondary Uses). If India.com proposes to use your personal identifying information for such Secondary Uses, you will be provided an opportunity at the time of data collection or transfer to instruct the India.com site to not allow such contact. It is completely optional for you to participate. If you opt-in to receive information from these business partners we will share your name and email address with them. You can opt-out of these services simply by not registering your preferences. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time.

4.Does that mean India.com sites sell my Personal Identifying Information to other companies?  
No, India.com does not sell, rent or loan customer/user lists. However, individual India.com sites may partner with businesses to provide special services to our customers/users. This type of use of Personal Identifying Information is called a "Secondary Use" because it is not necessary to the operation of the business or site. For example, a site may offer discount coupons for services or related products. In many cases these discounts would be an added benefit to our customers/users.

5\. What if I do not want my personal identifying information shared with another company?  
If an India.com site proposes to use your personal identifying information for Secondary Use, you will be provided an opportunity at the time of data collection or transfer to instruct the India.com site to not allow such contact. If you opt-in to receive information from these business partners we will share your name and email address with them. You can opt-out of these services simply by not registering your preferences. In the case of newsletters or mailing lists, you will be able to "unsubscribe" to these mailings at any time. You may also stop the delivery of future informational or promotional mail from India.com sites by following the instructions on the mail sent to you.. 

All Secondary Use that you request through India.com will include a removal procedure, which will allow you to discontinue Secondary Use. i.e., you can change your mind about Secondary Use.. 

If you receive a service from a third party stating that it is associated with India.com, yet you do not recall asking for the information, please follow the third party's removal procedures. If this procedure is not successful, please forward the e-mail with a summary of your experience to privacydirector@.india.com. 

Additionally, be aware that when you click on ad banners, you may be brought to other sites not operated by India.com. You are responsible for information you provide these sites. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that requests personal information.

6\. What about companies that partner with India.com sites to provide the site's products or services?  
An India.com site may have several necessary service partners who assist in providing the service or product associated with the site. As part of the operations of the site, these companies may have access to your personal identifying information. These companies may provide routine services, such as credit card processing, or may provide essential elements of the site. For example, shopping.india.com must provide contact information to its fulfillment partners in order to respond to be able to deliver the products ordered by you. Without this relationship shopping.india.com could not provide its service to you. These uses of your personal identifying information are primary to the operation of the site and are not considered Secondary Uses.

7\. What are cookies and how does India.com use them?   
India.com requires each member to enable cookies to login and use our services. 

What is a Cookie? - A cookie is a very small text file placed on your hard drive - with your permission - by a web server. 

Why do we use Cookies? - Identification: We use cookies to identify you uniquely. The use of "Cookies" is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. 

Tracking and Maintaining Session information: - Setting cookies is currently the best method of maintaining session information over the web. India.com may allow advertisers or partners to set cookies, however, only if they agree to abide by our privacy rules and policies. 

Are cookies secure? - A cookie cannot contain program codes, so it cannot be used as a virus nor can it be used to extract data from your system. When a cookie is set, only the server, which set the cookie, can access the information in that cookie. The use of cookies allows India.com to provide a higher level of security for your account. 

How do I change the way my browser handles cookies? - Most browsers allow three options for handling cookies: (i) Accept all cookies; (ii) Warn before accepting a cookie and (iii)Reject all cookies 

Our service will not function unless your browser is set to accept cookies. Instructions for enabling and disabling cookies can be found through the help menu on most browsers. If you have continued trouble changing your cookie settings, you may contact our support site for additional help.

8\. How does India.com protect the privacy of children younger than 13?   
We believe that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online.   
Note: India.com defines "children" as minors younger than 13 years.   
In compliance with the Children's On Line Privacy Protection Act, India.com does not allow children under 13 years to sign up for our services at this time.

9\. How do I access, change or delete information about myself?   
Your personal information can be accessed, or changed by selecting "My account" then "Personal Info" in the navigation bar on the left, once you are logged in. If you would like to close your account and delete your personal information from our online servers, you can send an e-mail to support@.India.com and follow the process to close an account. 

If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving promotional materials from India.com or promotional e-mails from third parties (which you signed up for), then follow the removal procedures at the end of the e-mail. If this is not successful, please contact us at [privacydirector@India.com.](mailto:privacydirector@india.com)

10\. How secure is my personal identifying information collected by India,com sites?  
India.com uses a variety of techniques and technologies to secure the information collected at its sites. Personal identifiable information collected online is stored in secure operating environments that are not accessible to the public. In many transaction oriented activities the personal identifiable information is encrypted before you conduct the transaction, such as in the case of credit card numbers.

11\. How may I protect my privacy on the Internet and within India.com?   
1.Know the risks: If you provide your e-mail address to public domains such as chat rooms or newsgroups, or you provide it to Web sites which don't respect your privacy, you may begin to receive unsolicited e-mail. Unsolicited e-mail is also known as spam. Although India.com has strict rules prohibiting spam and we do block certain known groups from sending unsolicited messages to India.com members, it is generally a good idea to provide your e-mail address only to people or groups that you trust. 

2.Educate yourself: Look for a privacy statement on every site you visit on the Web, and search for information on how to protect your privacy. 

3.Tell your children: "Never talk to strangers!": Teach children not to give out their names or other personal information. Tell them never to fill out online registration forms without your knowledge and consent. 

4.Use complex passwords: If your password is simple, it is also simple for a hacker to break it and gain access to your e-mail account or other private areas. To protect your privacy, you should use complex passwords consisting of very long and awkward keystroke combinations. This makes the hacker's job much more difficult. 

We send reminders of your account passwords only after the appropriate security questions have been answered. NEVER GIVE YOUR PASSWORD TO ANYONE. If someone claiming to represent India.com in an e-mail or chat room asks for your India.com password, DO NOT RESPOND. The only time we ask for your password is via a web page, when you need to access our system (such as the login screen). Please help us keep our records current by updating your personal information when it changes. You can access your personal information by selecting "My Account, Personal Information" from the navigation bar on the left, when you're logged into your account. 

This privacy policy is part of our User Agreement and you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions.
