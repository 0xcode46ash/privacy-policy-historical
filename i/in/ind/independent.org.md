## What Personal Information Does Independent.org Gather?

* Information You Give Us: We receive and store information you enter on our Web site through the shopping cart when making purchases in the [Store](https://web.archive.org/store/) section. We use the information that you provide for such purposes as responding to your requests, shipping ordered items to your address, and communicating with you.

## Does Independent.org Share the Information It Receives?

Occasionally we make our mailing list available to organizations from whom we think you’d like to receive offers. However, we do not share the email list of [Lighthouse](https://web.archive.org/publications/the_lighthouse/) recipients.

## What About Cookies?

* Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser. The shopping cart software uses cookies to remember your name and address so that you don’t have to re-enter it when making another purchase.

## How Secure Is Information About Me?

* We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.

* We reveal only the last six digits of your credit card numbers when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing.

## What Choices Do I Have?

* As discussed above, you can always choose not to provide information, even though it might be needed to make a purchase.

* If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please go to the Lighthouse page and unsubscribe, or respond to the message with “UNSUBSCRIBE” in the title.
