## Advertising Privacy Policy:

Some of the advertising on our Web site is served through third-party advertising companies.

These companies may use aggregated information ( **NOT including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number** ) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

## Giveaways, Promotions & Newsletter Privacy Policy:

We do not sell or share your information with anyone. The only time we will share your name with a venue is when you have won tickets to an event and your name needs to be on a guest list or at will call. We ask for your address for prizing that may need to be mailed out to you like a gift certificate, product, or actual event tickets.

Once you've sent your email with your personal information, you are entered into a prize lottery, we choose a winner on the designated date and then the emails are archived and discarded at the end of that calendar year. We keep them archived for a year for our records in case we need to look back on or account for anything. All personal information is used internally. 

We encourage you to sign up for our newsletters to be informed of all new content posted to our website, upcoming events and giveaways. These email addresses are never sold, given or shared with third parties.
