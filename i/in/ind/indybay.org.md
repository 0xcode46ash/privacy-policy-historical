SF Bay Area IMC reserves the right to send reports of DOS/spam activity to the spammer's internet service provider, and to post them publicly on its website. Only log entries pertaining directly to clear cases of website abuse will be so disseminated and/or preserved.

#### UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

> Cameryn Boyd was murdered. The police continue to kill young blacks and continue to justify themselves , because they are the "Police".... and that gives them the right (in their heads) to do whatever they think they can get away with...which is pretty much anything. These murders need to stop. Whoever wrote that Cameryn Boyd was a punk, is probably a cop. And whoever likened his Mother to the Wendy's finger lady is off their rocker. The police murdered a double amputee in cold blooded murder. They are getting paid to murder , torture and beat citizens. The police departments need to be ridden of the officers that do more harm than good. I don't know the answers. But I, as a Mom, I am overwhelmed with grief, and tired of going to young peoples funerals . Young people are not supposed to die... it's supposed to be the old folks!! And I support Marilyn . Maybe she will be the Mom that makes the difference...these murders must end!!! And I for one, I won't call a cop when there's a problem, because they (the cops) are so scarey. And I'm white!
