# privacy : SF Indymedia

### Privacy Policy

The SF IMC intends to give you the user as much control as possible over your personal information. We will let each user know how we will use the personal information derived from each user's access to and use of the web site services.

#### NOTICE

The SF-IMC web server does not track the domains or IP addresses from which people visit and/or post to the sf.indymedia.org web site. Usage of other services, however, may be logged.

The SF-IMC web site contains links to other websites, whether controlled by Indymedia affiliates or unrelated third parties. The SF IMC is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked website.

Currently, the SF IMC uses personal information as a basis for identifying the authors of published articles, and in order to allow individual user login to certain site functions, including ratings and admin. Names (and additional information that a user may choose to post) are publicly available on the SF-IMC site.

All e-mail sent to the SF-IMC is stored and publicly accessible at the [list archive](http://lists.indymedia.org/), including the sender's reported name and e-mail address.

#### CHOICE

Cookies
    The SF-IMC web site employs "cookies" as part of certain web site functions, including ratings and admin. A "cookie" is an element of data which a Service or site, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on the user's hard drive or memory. Cookies are sent only to users attempting to login to a particular function of the site; any cookies sent by sf.indymedia.org will be marked so that they will only be accessible to our web site. At his or her option and at his or her sole responsibility, any user may block or delete our cookies from his or her hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, the login features and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all.
Subscription-based News Emails
    Users may subscribe to receive site notifications, newsletters or other information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an SF-IMC list will include directions for how a user may remove him or herself from the list, or a URL where the user may find such directions.
Other Notification
    In order to arrange for the production of web content, print publications, and audio and video features, the SF IMC may use personal information to contact users on an individual basis.
Name, E-mail, Phone Number, Address Display
    Users' personal information may be publicly available through a user's published articles. Users have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their real names by typing in a pseudonym; users may choose to not disclose address or telephone contact information at all. Requests to remove personal identifying information from published articles must be e-mailed to [imc-sf-tech@indymedia.org](mailto:imc-sf-tech@indymedia.org). 
General
    In cases where users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information in conjunction with content published subject to the SF-IMC content usage policy, such personal information may or may not be disclosed as part of a non-commercial assemblage of Indymedia content, whether in print, electronic, audio or video. The producers of any such compilation will make every effort to contact the original author to determine whether credit/disclosure is desired.

At no time, unless a user specifically authorizes such disclosure, will the SF-IMC disclose individual user personal information that is not publicly available to unrelated third parties.

The SF-IMC e-mail lists, hosted at lists.indymedia.org, are configured such that all text messages sent to the list, along with names and e-mail addresses, are disclosed in the message archive. In addition, a complete list of subscribers may be available to third parties at the lists web site, although users can opt to conceal themselves from the subscriber list. Users concerned with privacy issues are encouraged to sign up for an anonymous e-mail service.

#### ACCESS

When technically feasible, users will be permitted to update their personal information directly through SF-IMC web site services. While such updating service is not technically feasible, the SF IMC will make reasonable efforts to assist users in updating their personal information. Please e-mail [imc-sf-tech@indymedia.org](mailto:imc-sf-tech@indymedia.org) for assistance.

#### SECURITY

To secure site integrity, the SF IMC employs measures including but not limited to security audits, use of encryption tools and software, and other reasonable security measures and procedures. Internal access to web server access logs and any nonpublic user information is restricted to site administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis.

#### ENFORCEMENT

In the event that the SF IMC becomes aware that site security is compromised or nonpublic user information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to law enforcement activities or external security attacks, the SF IMC shall take reasonable measures which it deems appropriate, including internal investigation and, if required, cooperation with our web host, Transbay.Net.

If the SF IMC becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to the SF IMC has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this Privacy Policy, the SF IMC shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that the SF IMC knows this information.

#### UPDATES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY

To update the privacy policy, we will post the changed version and its effective date at [http://www.indybay.org/process/privacy.php](https://web.archive.org/process/privacy.php).
