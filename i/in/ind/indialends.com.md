The loan is repaid in the form of EMIs (equated monthly instalments). Prior to disbursing the money into your bank account, you will be required to submit post-dated cheques or sign an ECS (electronic clearing service) mandate. An ECS mandate facilitates an automatic recurring transfer of the EMI amount from your account, for the tenure of the loan, taking all the hassle away from you. The process will be furtherexplained to you before loan disbursal. 

**Q. Can I pre-pay my loan?**  
While most lenders allow prepayment of loans, the prepayment rules vary from lender to lender. Some lenders may ask you to pay a fee for early closure while others don’t. From product features to your current situation, there are a lot of things to consider before you make this important decision. Get started with us here and we will help you get the right loan.
