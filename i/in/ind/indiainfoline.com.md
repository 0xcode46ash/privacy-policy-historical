Indiainfoline.com reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. Indiainfoline.com will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, users should be aware that Indiainfoline.com may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a Indiainfoline.com site.
