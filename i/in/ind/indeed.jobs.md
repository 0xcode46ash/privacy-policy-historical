Privacy Policy 

Indeed, Inc. ("Indeed") has created this Privacy Policy in order to disclose its use of consumer data collected about you. This Privacy Policy is effective as of January 27, 2010. You may contact Indeed at 177 Broad Street, Stamford, CT 06901 or via our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/support). The following discloses Indeed's information gathering and dissemination practices for its website.

_Information Collected and Received_ Indeed may collect or receive information about you when you register with the Indeed website or submit information , including, but not limited to, user name, password, first and last name, email address, street address, gender, occupation, interests, messages sent to other users, and any other data included in a submitted profile or resume. Indeed may collect information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information, ratings, reviews, questions, and answers. Indeed may also record actions taken on its websites including, but not limited to, clicks, page views, IP address, and search queries. Indeed may store this information on its equipment or the equipment of third parties that it has a relationship with. Please note that emails, messages sent via your web browser, and other similar means of communication with other users are not encrypted. We strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. 

_Uses of Information_ Indeed may use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Indeed uses this information, including but not limited to your searches, clicks, applications, messages, postings, to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We may use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities and activities that are detrimental to other users. We may use a variety of methods to detect and address anomalous activity and screen content to prevent abuse such as spam. These efforts may on occasion result in a temporary or permanent suspension or termination of some functions for some users. From time to time, we may, or companies we partner with may, contact you based on your interests such as job postings and career development opportunities. Indeed's site may require you to give Indeed contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information. Indeed may use your contact information to (i) send you job alerts; (ii) create an account; and (iii) send you information about Indeed and promotional material from some of Indeed's partners. Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Indeed may use demographic and/or profile data to tailor your experience on Indeed's site, show you content that Indeed thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences. To the extent you upload a resume, Indeed may make the resume and other personal information contained therein available to third parties or search engines. This means that the personal information contained in your resume can be viewed by third parties and you may receive unsolicited contact from parties unaffiliated with Indeed. Indeed reserves the right to disclose any information when required by law. We may use other companies to perform services necessary to our operations. In the course of providing these services, those companies may have access to your personal information. By contractual agreement, those companies must treat your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. However, we will not be liable for any damages that may result from the misuse of your personal information by these companies. Indeed may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with Indeed's service and to administer Indeed's site. Your IP address may also be used to help identify you, your location, and your online profile and to gather broad demographic information. Nothing shall restrict Indeed from maintaining your data following your termination of your relationship with Indeed. Indeed may delete your user data at Indeed’s sole discretion. Indeed offers an "Indeed Resume" feature that allows users to publish their resumes to the public internet. This Indeed Resume may be crawled by, and displayed through, search engines when someone searches for your name. You may opt-out of this feature by editing your Privacy Settings; however, Indeed does not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public resume information. 

_Security_ Indeed uses industry-standard technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged between Indeed and other companies to help ensure its security. This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under Indeed's control. 

_Cookies_ "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Indeed's site uses cookies to keep track of your session and advertising delivery. Indeed may also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password. We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our website. These companies may use third-party cookies to record information (not including your name, address, email address, or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. You can learn more [here](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/). 

_Links_ Indeed may create links to other web sites. When you click on links on Indeed you may leave our site. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites, and we encourage you to read their privacy statements. 

_Amendments_ Indeed may amend this policy at any time. If Indeed is going to use personally identifiable information collected through Indeed's site in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection Indeed will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on Indeed's website for 30 days prior to such use. 

_Assignment_ If there is a change of control in Indeed’s business (whether by merger, sale, or otherwise) or if there is an asset sale, the user information, including personal information, could be sold as part of that transaction and your personally identifying information potentially could be used by the purchaser. However, if that business materially changes this statement or the information-handling practices as described in this Privacy Policy, you will be notified by email and/or through a notice posted on the website, and you may opt-out of the use of your existing information in a new manner. This Privacy Policy inures to the benefit of any successors or assigns of Indeed or the assets of Indeed. 

_Contacts_ If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this web site, you can [contact us](https://web.archive.org/support).
