TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Webcapacity Incorporated / IndianMatches.com wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to publish our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, Webcapacity Incorporated / IndianMatches.com has agreed to disclose:

  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.
  * The kind of security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Webcapacity Incorporated's control.

**Collection of your Personal Information**  
IndianMatches.com explicitly asks when it needs information that personally identifies you ("Personal Information") pertinent to the specific product or service you are choosing to use or subscribe to on the IndianMatches.com web sites. This information can include your e-mail address, name, address, and telephone number, as applicable. IndianMatches.com also may ask for non-personal information or demographic information. None of the information we gather can be used by the public (visitors, other members, and anyone not employed by IndianMatches.com, its corporate affiliates, or the financial institutions we use to process membership charges) to identify a specific individual. Members choose when to disclose their personal information at their own risk such as when contacting others through the contact system, listing any personal contact information on their profile, participating in the online chat rooms or the instant messenger service. 

We are a membership-based service. We collect the name and email address of standard account members. For Deluxe account members we collect credit card, address, or bank information only from those who choose to pay for a Deluxe account. No credit card information is stored on our servers. Anyone on the Internet can search our profiles or sign up for a standard free account and use all standard member features at no charge. Anyone is also welcome to create a online profile free of charge. For maximum exposure, member profiles are viewable on any of the IndianMatches.com web sites, including any of our "co-branded" partner sites. All sites of IndianMatches.com are owned and operated by Webcapacity Incorporated and none of the information is shared with any third party unless you join on our partner "co-brand" sites in which you will be notified up-front that your IndianMatches.com information will be shared with the IndianMatches.com co-brand partner. All IndianMatches.com web sites and profiles reside on our one central database and on no third party systems. 

IndianMatches.com gathers two types of information: information that users submit to us and information not directly submitted by users. 

**Information submitted to IndianMatches.com**  
There are two types of information we collect that users submit: public and private. We define private information to be any information that allows others to contact a user other than through IndianMatches.com or allows the collection of information about the user other than what is displayed on the site. Public information is personal information that may be displayed on the site, such as gender, age and height, but cannot be linked to a particular user. (Except in the case of a Deluxe member who chooses to list their contact information in their profile which is viewable to all.) 

_Private Information:_   
The information gathered from standard free account members includes, email address, IP address, first and last name. 

The information gather from Deluxe members includes all of the above in addition to credit card info, address and other billing information. Credit card numbers are never committed to disk on our servers (stored on our servers). Credit card numbers are only used during real time authorization/billing and all transmissions over the Internet are encrypted via industry standard SSL. 

_Public Information:_  
To accomplish the goal of bringing compatible individuals together, we must gather personal information such as gender, age, appearance, caste, religion and more for the online profiles. This information is meant to be seen by members and visitors to the site but cannot be used to identify a specific member by name, address, etc. IndianMatches.com does not require individuals to include contact information in their profile descriptions/text fields however Deluxe account holders can do so if they choose. Members are also free to disclose anything they wish in our online chat rooms or instant messenger service should they choose to do so. Any contact/personal information that is disclosed in those areas is done so at the members own risk. 

Information that users do not submit to us is aggregate information: This is information we collect that is not personally identifiable, such as what kind of browser you are using, IP address and occasionally trace route to your computer. This information is gathered for all visitors to the site. 

**Use of your Personal Information**  
_Private Information:_  
IndianMatches.com and our sites use your personal information to operate the IndianMatches.com sites and to provide the services you have requested. The information is also used to communicate with you regarding your IndianMatches.com account by sending out periodic newsletters and notices that are considered as essential to the operation of the service. If the member wishes to be removed from this list ,they can login with their username and password, go to their member home page, and then click on "Email preferences". There they can choose to be removed from our list. The non-personal information is used to compile general demographic statistics which is shared in the aggregate with IndianMatches.com advertisers. We also use your e-mail address to respond to incoming service and support requests from you, to collect customer feedback, customer satisfaction surveys, and other service informational mailings. Should the situation arise, customer information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. All information collected in our registration process is not accessible by other members except for the following: 

If a member has a profile on the site and another member contacts them, an email is sent to the contacted member with their message and the contacter's reply-to email address. What the contacter discloses in this email is up to them and is done at their own risk. If the contacted member wishes to respond it is up to them how to do it and what they want to disclose. They can retrieve the contacter's reply-to email address via their contact manager or in the initial message itself. When a member contacts another member on the site via our contact system they are disclosing their email address on file to the contacted at their own risk. This is done so the contacted can get back in touch with them. 

Deluxe account members can also choose to display their contact information in their profile and do this at their own risk since the information is publicly viewable to all visitors of IndianMatches.com. 

Deluxe account members who choose to particpate in the online chat rooms or instant messenger service can choose to disclose anything they wish during their chat sessions and do this at their own risk.

_Public Information:_  
Public information supplied by the user on their profile is intended to be viewed by visitors and members of the site. This information is disclosed by members at their discretion. 

Information that users do not submit to us is aggregate information: We use your server, IP address, and browser-type related information in the general administration of our web site for tracking where people come from and other data. 

**Sharing your Personal Information with Third Parties**  
IndianMatches.com does not disclose any member information with any other third party except as disclosed in the privacy statement or unless you have joined on a "co-branded" partner site. In the latter case you are notified up-front before you join a IndianMatches.com co-branded site if your membership/information will be shared with a IndianMatches.com partner. 

**Third Party Links**  
Any links to sites outside of IndianMatches.com or the IndianMatches.com sites, are not controlled or operated by IndianMatches.com. Hence this privacy information no longer applies when you leave this site. This includes links to partners, any banner ads, or links in individuals profiles etc. 

**Use of Cookies**  
To make it easy and convenient for you to login to our services, the IndianMatches.com site does require you to enable cookies to utilize our services. Because we use cookies, you can bookmark your IndianMatches.com start page and access your account without logging in.

A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. Our server generates a random pair of numbers that is placed in three cookies, and is set in your browser. This random pair of numbers is then sent back to the server each time you request a page on the IndianMatches.com site. Our server uses those numbers to identify your computer, and for example, remember where you were in your search results or any of the various things that can be customized on IndianMatches.com. Rest assured that there is absolutely NO PERSONAL information being stored on your machine or sent back and forth between your computer and IndianMatches.com. Our cookies only store those two random numbers and cannot personally identify you. Note however that if you are a logged in member on a shared computer or public kiosk remember to click on the logout button. This will log you out of your session and prevent others from accessing your account.

Also note that if you are a member and want to login, we provide two ways to do this. The first being a standard login which your username and password are transmitted in clear text, and the second being a SSL encrypted login form which transmits your username and password in a more secure encrypted fashion. Also note that, unlike some other sites which pass your username and password in each HTTP request's Authorization header, your username and password are only transmitted once and not each request. Once again, your username or password are not stored in a cookie. IndianMatches.com also makes certain pages accessible via SSL to its members, such as billing history or editing/viewing your personal information. It is optional for members to use however we added it for our members convenience and privacy. For paying members also note that absolutely no credit card numbers are stored on our servers.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you will not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the IndianMatches.com site and on other IndianMatches.com Web sites or other web sites you visit. 

**Control of your Personal Information**  
Members have full control over any information they submit to this site. The members profile can be edited, deleted, or hidden at anytime by logging in with the username and password and clicking the "Update profile" link. The members private information can be modified at anytime via the same process above, by selecting the "edit my information" link. The only exception to the above is information a member submits on our payment forms. This is not editable by members because we need to keep a static record of all transactions.

If you have chosen to receive information from IndianMatches.com and then at a later date decide you do not wish to continue receiving such information, you can unsubscribe by logging with your username and password, go to your member home page, and then click on "Email preferences". There you can choose to be removed from our list. You can also choose to deactivate your account from your member home page. This will also have the effect of removing you from all mailings.

**Security of your Personal Information**  
IndianMatches.com secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. IndianMatches.com secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number and other financial information) is transmitted over the Internet, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

**Use of Privacy Statements by IndianMatches.com Partners and Affiliates**  
While IndianMatches.com supports other web site operators using IndianMatches.com services complying with these principles, you should carefully examine the privacy statements of sites linking to or from IndianMatches.com. Personal information that you choose to provide to other web sites will be subject to the privacy policies of that specific web site. 

**Use of Third Party Ad Networks**  
Many of the online banner advertisements you see on the IndianMatches.com Web sites are displayed by IndianMatches.com. In addition, IndianMatches.com also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to display advertisements on IndianMatches.com Web sites. To do this, ad networks place a persistent cookie on your computer. Doing this allows the ad network to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement. In this way, ad networks may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw their advertisements and determine which ads are clicked on. This information allows an ad network to deliver advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. IndianMatches.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks.

IndianMatches.com may maintain relationships with a number of the third-party ad networks currently operating such as Burst Media, India Ad Network, India Link Exchange, and Microsoft BCentral. If you want to prevent one of these third-party companies from sending and reading cookies on your computer, you will need to either set your browser to decline third party cookies or visit each ad network's web site individually or request that you be removed from its system. To find out more about these ad agencies and their privacy policies you can visit their web sites:  
<http://www.burstmedia.com/>  
<http://www.bcentral.com/>

**Changes to this Statement**  
IndianMatches.com will occasionally update this Privacy Statement to reflect company and customer feedback. When IndianMatches.com posts changes to this Statement, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Statement. If there are material changes to this Statement, IndianMatches.com will notify you by placing prominent notice on the Web site or via email. IndianMatches.com encourages you to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how IndianMatches.com is protecting your information.
