If you choose to provide such information, you are giving IMO the permission to use and store it consistent with this policy. Therefore, please understand when you sign in to the IMO site, you are not anonymous to us.

Account Information is used:

-   emailing of system messages, personal IMO messages, IMO newsletters, special offers and other IMO communications.

-    to determine whether you are of legal age to view mature content.

Your supplied gender, age and chosen username will be displayed as part of your public profile, you may however, also elect to provide more information about yourself in your profile. IMO does not require you to fill out the extra fields on your profile in order to participate in the service or community.  IMO makes no claims about the privacy of publicly available profile information.

(iii) Cookies, log files and clear GIF information

When you visit the IMO Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. IMO uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the IMO Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

When you use the IMO Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

When you use the IMO Site, we may employ "clear GIFs" (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our Members anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our Members to track which emails are opened by recipients.

The cookies, log files and clear GIF information is used to:

-   remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the IMO Site;

-   provide custom, personalized content and information;

-   monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;

-   monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; 

-    track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions and contests;

-   determine where you are accessing the IMO site from geographically and which services are therefore available.

(iv) Surveys and polls:

IMO values opinions and comments from members, so we may conduct online surveys. Participation in these surveys is entirely optional. Typically, the information is aggregated and used to make improvements to IMO and to develop appealing content, features and promotions for members. Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey.

(v) Forums, comments and private messaging

Any personally identifiable information you submit through the forums and comments system can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums or by private message to other users.

(vi) Combined information

We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the IMO Site and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends

(vii) Anonymous aggregated data

Anonymous data is information (originally personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable) that subsequently is used in aggregate form. We may use anonymous data for purposes of research or analysis. We may conduct research on our customer demographics, internet usage, and interests and behavior based on personal data we gather. Although anonymous data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. 

(viii) Film viewing history

IMO stores information about which films you watch in streaming flash format. The list of films is also posted to your public profile.

This information is used to:

-   improve the site experience.

-   allow friends to recommend movies to each other.

-   track film watches so we can return royalties to the film distributors. 

**3) When IMO Discloses Information**

We may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with information about IMO's features, services, and other offerings that may be of interest to you;  send information or offers to users on behalf of IMO's partners (please note that if we were to do this, we would not give those partners personally identifiable information such as your name or address); or share your personally identifiable information with advertisers, business partners, and other entities that are not affiliated with IMO who would like to send you information about their products and services.
