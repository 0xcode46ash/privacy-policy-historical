# IndyMac Bank - Privacy Policy

IndyMac Bank Privacy Policy 

We Respect Your Privacy 

We understand that your privacy is very important to you, and we share your concern that the information you provide us will be safeguarded. That’s why IndyMac Bank and our affiliated companies have adopted these privacy principles and guidelines. We value the trust you have placed in us and are committed to earning and maintaining your confidence. 

Introduction 

This privacy policy will tell you about the kinds of information we collect from our customers, how we use that information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties. 

Information Collection 

IndyMac Bank will collect information about you only where we reasonably believe the information will be necessary or useful in processing or administering products or services you have requested from us, or providing products, services and other opportunities that we think will be of interest to you. 

We collect the following types of information from our customers: (1) information provided by you to us in connection with obtaining financial products and services from us, such as mortgage loans, deposit accounts and investment products and services, (2) information contained in your consumer report, (3) information obtained from non-affiliated third parties, such as companies that aggregate data for marketing purposes, and (4) information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others. 

Maintenance of Accurate Information 

Keeping your information as accurate, current and complete as possible is very important. If you ever find that our records are inaccurate or not current, please contact us at the telephone number on your account statement. If the record is within our control, we will correct any inaccurate or incomplete information. 

Security Procedures to Protect Customer Information 

We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need access to our systems to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your nonpublic personal information. 

Information Sharing Within Our Affiliated Family of Companies 

To provide you with superior service, inform you of product and service opportunities that may be of interest to you, and for other business purposes, IndyMac Bank may share information about you with certain of our affiliated companies, such as financial services providers, including consumer and mortgage banking companies, life and casualty insurance companies, insurance agencies, securities brokerage firms, trust companies, and companies that provide settlement services, such as title agencies, escrow companies and appraisal firms. An “affiliated company” or “affiliate” is a company that we own or control, or that is owned or controlled by our parent holding company. 

The information we provide to our affiliates includes (i) identifying information, such as your name, address and social security number, and (ii) information about the financial product or service you obtain from us, such as your deposit balance, investment history, loan balance and/or payment history, as applicable. 

Under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, we are permitted to share your name, address and facts about your transactions and experiences with us (such as your loan payment history) within our affiliated family of companies. 

Information Sharing With Third Party Marketing Service Providers And Joint Marketers 

Unlike some other banks, IndyMac Bank does not sell customer lists or other information about our customers to unaffiliated parties. However, in order to efficiently and cost-effectively market our own products, we do contract with companies that offer marketing services, such as printers, marketing fulfillment and other companies that provide marketing and solicitation services. As part of these activities, we may provide limited information about our customers to such parties. In addition, we may occasionally engage in joint marketing with unaffiliated parties for various financial products and services (such as credit life and disability insurance) that IndyMac Bank does not offer on its own, but we think will be of interest to you. In such cases, IndyMac Bank will always be identified in the joint marketing materials or solicitation. As part of these joint marketing activities, we may provide certain information about our customers to our joint marketing partners. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described in “Information Collection” above, to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements. 

Information Sharing Permitted By Law 

In addition to the third parties described above, we also may share customer information to certain nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. 

Our Former Customers 

After you are no longer a customer of Indymac Bank, we will continue to treat the information we have about you as if you were still our customer.
