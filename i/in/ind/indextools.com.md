# Yahoo! Web Analytics

Yahoo! Web Analytics is a browser-based tracking system used to identify and track visitors to our customers' websites. We allow our customers to specify the types of information we collect about visitors to their websites. This generally consists of anonymous data sent by your web browser to us as part of your interaction with our customer's website, such as IP address, time spent on web pages, links clicked, or advertisements viewed on those pages. This data is sent to Yahoo! Web Analytics through web beacon and cookie technology so we can report statistical information back to the customer. Yahoo! may use the anonymous data collected through Yahoo! Web Analytics in order to improve our products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to users. 

Our customers may request that we collect customized data fields on their behalf. This may include personal information such as email address. We do not share customer reports or any personal information of users with third parties. We require our customers to post information about data collection practices in their respective privacy policies.

Web Beacon Use, Cookie Use & Data Collection

Yahoo! Web Analytics uses web beacons and cookies to provide services to our customers. Typically, Web beacons (also known as "clear GIFs") are small transparent images built into the coding of a webpage and used with cookies to help identify user interactions with a website. Yahoo! Web Analytics' cookies do not include personal information such as name, age, or phone number. However, our customers sometimes request that we include personal information, such as an email address, in the web beacon's data fields. Our customers provide this personal information for us to insert into the Yahoo! Web Analytics database and we use this personal information only on our customer's behalf. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies, but you may not be able to sign in or use other features of websites that use cookies as part of the user experience.
