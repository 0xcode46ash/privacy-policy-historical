Privacy Policy

The following information describes how we handle the information we gather about visitors to our customers' web sites as well as information about our customers' visits to our web site to retrieve their reports. 

General Information

IndexTools is firmly committed to the privacy of customers and visitors to its web sites. We are equally committed to the privacy of the data we collect for sites using IndexTools Web Analytics, and the visitors who frequent those sites. The following principles disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for IndexTools Web Analytics. Other IndexTools products may have different policies. 

Privacy Statement for Visitors to Sites Tracked by IndexTools Web Analytics

**Privacy Principles**

Because your privacy is important to us, IndexTools conducts its business under the following principles: 

Principle 1 - No Collection of Personal Information 

IndexTools does not collect personal information such as name, age, phone number and mailing address from visitors to our customer's web sites. 

Principle 2 - No Combination of Browsing and Web Traffic Information with Personal Information 

Since IndexTools does not collect any personal information, we do not combine traffic analysis information with personal information such as name, age, phone number and mailing address. 

Principle 3 - No Aggregation of Individual Visitor Traffic Patterns across Multiple Sites 

IndexTools does not collect individual profile information for visitors across multiple sites and does not aggregate information from any other sources about browsing patterns of individual visitors across multiple sites. 

Principle 4 - Use of Anonymous IP Address 

IP addresses are recorded by every site on the internet. IndexTools collects this information as well, but does so exclusively for the following uses: (1) anonymous statistical purposes; or (2) administration of our web site and servers, and to improve our services. 

Principle 5 - Anonymous Use of Cookies 

It is IndexTools' policy to use cookies only for more accurate anonymous traffic analysis. The cookie information does NOT include personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address or mailing address. In addition, IndexTools does NOT link cookies to personal data such as name, age, phone number, e-mail address and mailing address. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies. 

Principle 6 - Limited Use of Cookies 

IndexTools Web Analytics uses cookies to track such as the time/date of the visit, the time/date of last visit, the page viewed, the referrer, transaction information for eCommerce pages, and other data. The cookies never include personal information such as name, mailing address and phone number. We do not collect such information and visitors that we track can not provide us with personal information through normal movement across a web site. As we do not build a database of individual visitors, the data that we do collect is never stored in any individual user profile; the data collected serves only to update aggregate counts allowing our customers to monitor traffic on their site. Visitors can also reject cookies. 

Privacy Statement for Customers Using IndexTools Web Analytics to Track their websites 

**Privacy Principles**

Because your privacy is important to us, IndexTools conducts its business under the following principles: 

Principle 1 - Your Information is Confidential 

All the statistical information we compile for your web site is considered confidential. Statistics about your websites are protected by usernames and passwords; do not disclose these to unauthorized persons. To ensure this privacy, our Data Center is protected by industry standard security technology, such as firewalls and security analyzers using SSL encryption to protect transmission of data. 

Principle 2 - IndexTools Has Limited Access to your Information 

IndexTools will not access, modify, or otherwise divulge the statistical information we compile for your site except for the express purpose of generating reports which have been authorized by you or otherwise agreed to by you, or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of IndexTools; (3) enforce the IndexTools Terms of Service; or (4) troubleshoot any service problems. 

Principle 3 - No Site-Specific Data is Ever Divulged 

IndexTools Web Analytics compiles statistics across all the web sites it serves concerning certain broad categories, such as internet browser usage and screen resolution. This information is presented only in an aggregate form, and in no event will we present specific site data without permission. 

Principle 4 - Use of Cookies 

Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a web site more useful by personalizing information for visitors and by storing information about your preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. It is IndexTools' policy to use cookies only for the following purposes: 

  * To identify you
  * To customize our site for you
  * To help improve navigation

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies. However, you will not be able to take advantage of IndexTools Web Analytics if you do so. Your visitors can also reject cookies. If a visitor to your web site rejects cookies, IndexTools Web Analytics captures only a subset of the information necessary to generate all traffic reports. 

Principle 5 - Personal Information 

Our site's registration form may require users who signed up for our service to give us contact information (such as their name and e-mail address), and financial information (such as their credit card numbers). Personal and financial information that is collected is used to check the user's qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. IndexTools does not store such information linked to a cookie. 

We may use this information to: 

  * Contact you when necessary
  * Send you information about our company
  * Send you promotional material from some of our partners
