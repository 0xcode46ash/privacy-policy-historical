System Specifications

**Search**  
The website's search facilities are driven by the Microsoft SQL Server standard free text search algorithm. The search is implemented using Microsoft SQL Sever 2005 fulltext search features known as "CONTAINSTABLE" and "FREETEXTTABLE". The "CONTAINSTABLE" feature makes use of a "search phrase" and the number of occurrences to derive the ranking for content whereas the "FREETEXTTABLE" search makes use of the OKAPI BM25 ranking formula. The detail of each feature is provided in the following link http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx. The key highlights of a search using these features is described below: 

  * A search calculates rankings based on the search string provided by the user. The ranking is based on predefined search algorithms bundled with SQL Server 2005.
  * The search term and each individual term within the search string is ranked, and the values are summed to arrive at a final ranking score.
  * There are a large number of words which occur very frequently and are not helpful in resolving searches. Such words are referred to as noise words. For example words which linguists class as articles, such as the, a, and at are for the most part irrelevant in a search. These words are not included as part of a search.
  * The ranking for terms is decided based on ethical frequency of terms and the density or frequency of search terms occurring relative to the other terms. 
  * The search will also add words to the query via inflectional generation (stemmed forms of the original query terms); For example if the user query contains 'label' word, the search will also look for words like 'labeling', 'labeled' etc. These words are treated as separate terms with no special weighting or relationship with the words from which they were generated. 
  * Synonyms generated from the Thesaurus feature are treated as separate, equally weighted terms to determine ranking.
