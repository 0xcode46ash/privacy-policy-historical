System Specifications

_Search_  
The Storefront search is driven by the standard free text search algorithm provided by Microsoft SQL Server. The search is implemented uses using Microsoft SQL Sever 2005 fulltext search features known as "CONTAINSTABLE" and "FREETEXTTABLE". The "CONTAINSTABLE" feature make use of "search phrase" and the number of occurrence to derive the ranking for a Storefront whereas the "FREETEXTTABLE" search make use of a well known ranking formula called OKAPI BM25 to determine the ranking. The detail of each feature is provided in the following link [ http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524.aspx). The key highlights of the search using these feature is described below: 

  * A search looks within two databases: "Company" and "Products". The fields being searched in the "Company" database are "Business Name", "Description", "Keywords", "Comments", "City" and "State. For "Products" the fields being searched are "Name", "Introduction" and "Full Content".
  * A search calculates a ranking for each Storefront based on the search string provided by the user. The ranking is based on predefined search algorithms bundled with SQL Server 2005.
  * The search term and each individual term with-in the search string is ranked, and the values are summed to arrive at a final ranking score.
  * There are a large number of words which occurred very frequently and which are not helpful in resolving searches. Such words are referred to as noise words. For example words which linguists class as articles, such as the, a, and at are for the most part irrelevant in a search. This words are not included as part of search.
  * The rank for the terms is decided based on frequency of the term and the density or frequency of the search term occurring relative to the other terms. 
  * The search will also add words to the query via inflectional generation (stemmed forms of the original query terms); For example if the user query contains 'label' word, the search will also look for words like 'labeling', 'labeled' etc. These words are treated as separate terms with no special weighting or relationship with the words from which they were generated. 
  * Synonyms generated from the Thesaurus feature are treated as separate, equally weighted terms to determine ranking.
