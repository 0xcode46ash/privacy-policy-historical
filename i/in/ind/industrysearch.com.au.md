**NEWS & INFORMATION POLICY  
**  
This section outlines the policies and definitions for information published by INDUSTRACOM.

Editorial integrity is a high priority to INDUSTRACOM and as an Australian media & information company, INDUSTRACOM acknowledges a responsibility to publish relevant and accurate news and information . We do not assume responsibility for damages or inaccuracies as a result of information provided or published online advertisers or other independent sources as we act primarily as a conduit for information in these instances.

Information published by INDUSTRACOM originates typically from the following sources: _ _News Wire Services__ -  INDUSTRACOM acquires information from news wire services including Australian Associated Press Pty Limited (AAP) for which it is licensed, authorised and under contract to publish relevant news articles. _ _Advertisers__ \- Advertisers publish and submit content to be featured by INDUSTRACOM. When viewing advertiser information our system provides an indication that content is associated with an advertiser by featuring their name and/or logo together with a link to their profile (Storefront), so as not to confuse advertiser information  with independent news sources. Only selected news & feature articles provided by advertisers are published group content areas of the website (News Centre, Breaking News, DailyNewsWire Email), whereas the majority of products and events published by advertisers will be featured on group content areas. All of a Storefront Advertiser's content will be featured within their own independent Storefront page as well as being searchable on the website. Storefront Advertisers have password protected access to their own Storefront Management Area where they can upload and publish information directly into our system. All content submitted by Storefront Advertisers is viewed and validated by INDUSTRACOM's editorial department before going live on the website. _ _External Sources__ -  INDUSTRACOM receives news, feature articles and events submitted from individuals, government, industry and commercial organisations and determines at its own discretion which information to publish. Selections are make typically based on relevance to our audience, professionalism in writing presentation and style and perceived accuracy of information. INDUSTRACOM maintains full discretion in the selection of information published on its websites.

INDUSTRACOM will update this privacy policy as required. If changed, the changes will be posted on INDUSTRACOM's websites so that users are made aware of what information is collected, how it is used and when it may be disclosed. If at any time INDUSTRACOM is required by law to release information, we are obliged to cooperate fully under our legal duty.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to acts or practices of INDUSTRACOM that are directly related to employee records of current or former employees. 

 _ _Sponsor Messages__ \- All subscribers to INDUSTRACOM's free e-mail newsletters automatically receive sponsor messages. This is a condition of subscription. Sponsor messages subsidise our newsletters and allow INDUSTRACOM to provide high quality news and information free of charge, much like free-to-air television. We make every effort maintain a good relationship with our readers/subscribers and therefore limit the number of sponsor messages sent and attempt to ensure they are relevant and valuable offers.

__Unsolicited & Lawful Offers__ \- Requests placed with INDUSTRACOM advertisers must be of a legal and lawful nature and must be in relation to the nature of business conducted by the advertiser. We strongly encourage individuals not to utilise INDUSTRACOM communication facilities to solicit businesses in relation to items which have not been requested (i.e. unsolicited offers). **Collection of Information**

Advertisers and sponsors are at no time provided any specific details of our audience or subscribers.

In instances when advertising campaigns require registration or request information, subscribers are made clearly aware that the response mechanism of the advertising campaign will send information to the sponsor, if readers/subscribers/visitors participate.

__Advertiser Requests__ \- When visitors sends an email request (through an online form) to an advertiser, INDUSTRACOM stores information such as (but not limited to): name, phone number and address, email and message details.

Requests are sent automatically to advertisers by email and the same information is stored and viewable in the advertisers' secure online management area. _ _Search Terms__ \- When a search is performed, our system gathers basic information such as the search word, search term, date and the time the search was performed. We store and track this information for internal trend analysis. Information such as who performed the search is not gathered or tracked. _ _Directory Categories__ \- When a category in our directory is clicked our system gathers basic information such as the number of times each category is viewed.

Information such as who viewed or clicked content is not gathered or tracked. If visitors place a request to advertisers using one of our online forms then this information is stored and provided to advertisers.

__Secure Storage of Information__ \- INDUSTRACOM takes reasonable steps and has security measures designed to protect against the loss, misuse and/or alteration of information.

  We employ a number of means to protect information including:

__Getting started_ \- _To setup a Storefront, advertisers can deal directly with INDUSTRACOM or with a reseller, advertising agency or registered affiliate. __

 _ _Step 1 - Set-up Profile__ \- Once a _Storefront Activation Form_ is received, advertisers are sent an e-mail outlining the requirements to setup their Storefront's profile. This includes such items as a company description, contact details and logo. Storefront Advertisers can request for one of our consultants to setup their profile on their behalf, using information found on the advertisers website or other electronic promotional material provided. _ _Step 2 - Upload Content__ \- Once Step 1 is completed, Storefront owners are ready to upload their content (products, news releases, feature articles and events), which is the most important aspect of the Storefront in generating results. Storefront owners are provided with a username and password to gain access to their Storefront Management Area to upload content. Here a Storefront User Guide helps advertisers understand how best to utilise their Storefront. 

Storefront owners should focus initially on having all their main Products & Services showcased in their Storefront. News releases, Feature articles and Events can then also be uploaded. 

Each Storefront owner receives 1 hour of free setup work performed by our consultants if requested. Free email support is provided and additional setup or support packages can be purchased. 

To generate the most effective results from your Storefront, we urge businesses to keep their Storefront information up to date with new products, services and other relevant information as soon as it becomes available.
