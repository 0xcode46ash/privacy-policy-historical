In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to indisearch.com.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. For example, indisearch.com may use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that tells us how and when pages in our site are visited, and by how many people. indisearch.com cookies do not collect personally identifiable information and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personally identifiable information to tell us who you are or even what your screen name or e-mail address is. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our indisearch.com partners about how our "members", collectively, use indisearch.com. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your site and to gather broad demographic information, as well as to protect against fraud. We track IP addresses in forms for this reason.

Our site's registration form requires users to give us only site address (URL) and valid e-mail address.
