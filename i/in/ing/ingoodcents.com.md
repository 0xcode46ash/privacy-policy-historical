# Privacy Policy — In Good Cents™

This site does request information during [giveaways](http://ingoodcents.com/category/giveaways "Giveaways") or surveys, such as your e-mail address. If you [win a giveaway](http://ingoodcents.com/tag/winners "giveaway winner"), additional information is necessary to provide you with your prize(s). Aside from prize winners, this site does not collect information such as your phone number, address, or other private information. I understand that **privacy of your information is very important**.

Information, such as your e-mail address, is also collected when you comment or ask a question.  This is used to answer any questions or reply to your comment, as well as alert you if anyone else replies to your comment.  Your e-mail address is only available to me and can not be seen by other readers.  Also note, that [I do “follow”](http://savvyblogging.net/using-the-nofollow-attribute-helps-page-rank/ "no follow links") (or at least I let Google “follow”) all website links in comments and pingbacks or links back to my site, unless they are [spam comments](http://ingoodcents.com/about/faq "frequently asked questions").

This information is used only to [target](http://ingoodcents.com/shop/target) advertising.

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on this site.   Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on visits to this site and other sites on the Internet.   You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the [Google ad and content network privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html "google opt out policy").

This site  collects information to:

  * Improve the site
  * Administer giveaways, contests, promotions, surveys, and other site features
  * To distribute [daily e-mails to subscribers](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=ingoodcents&loc=en_US "subscribe by e-mails")



If you [subscribe to In Good Cents by e-mail](http://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=ingoodcents&loc=en_US "subscribe by e-mails"), you do opt in to receiving one e-mail per day with a round-up of the latest deals.  These e-mails are sent each day between 5:00 PM and 7:0o PM.  Each e-mail has directions for you to easily unsubscribe, if you choose to do so.

As a frugal blog, I often link to offers from third parties or services that are not part of this site.  These parties have separate and independent privacy policies.  Therefore, I have no responsibility or liability for the content or activities of those linked sites.  Nevertheless, I do try hard to only link to reliable and reputable sites and seek to protect the integrity of my own site.
