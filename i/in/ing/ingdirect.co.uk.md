**Where we obtain your information from**

Information provided by you 

The information we collect via this website may include any personal details you type in and submit (such as your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) and the contents of any correspondence you send to us. 

IP addresses 

The information we collect via this website may also include your IP address (this is your computer’s individual identification number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet) which is automatically logged by our web-server in the UK.  Unless we suspect fraud, we do not use your IP address to identify you personally. 

Cookies & spotlight tags 

This website also collects data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website. 

  * This information is collected by using temporary ‘ _session cookies_ ’.  These are small strings of data stored in your device’s temporary memory when you navigate around the website but which are deleted when you close your Web browser. 
  * This information is also collected by using _spotlight tags_ (also known as ‘boom tags’, ‘clear GIFs’, ‘pixel tags’, ‘web beacons’ and ‘web bugs’).  These are small strings of computer code that are placed in the pages of our website which allow our advertising agents to store ‘ _persistent cookies_ ’ in your Web browser’s cookie file when you access our website.  Unlike session cookies, these persistent cookies are not deleted when you close your Web browser. 



We use the ‘session’ cookies employed in this website to enable you to move back and forth within a secure banking session and to save you re-entering information. 

Our session cookies and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies do not store your e-mail address or other personal information. 

**How we use your information and who we share it with**

Keeping you informed 

You do not have to give us any personal information in order to use many of the pages of this website.  However, any information which you choose to give us through this website may be added to our marketing database and may be used by us for marketing our services and our events. 

It is possible that our marketing materials may contain input from other companies or organisations we are dealing with, but we DO NOT sell or give your details to any other companies for them to try to sell you their products or services. 

Targeting our advertising 

Our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used to target our Internet advertisements which appear on other websites.  This means that the adverts will be selected based on the information we hold about you.  This allows us to improve the effectiveness of our advertising. 

Statistical analysis 

The IP addresses (please see above for details) logged by our web-server and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used by us: 

  * to perform technical diagnosis of our website’s performance on a statistical basis; 
  * to analyse traffic data (so as to gauge interest in our website and to improve our understanding of our websites visitors’ behaviour and their response to our promotional campaigns); and 
  * to identify unusual transactions (in order to identify the source of fraudulent actions.) 



Law enforcement & crime prevention 

We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating to our website users.  We will have no legal liability for disclosing information in these circumstances. 

Other sharing of information 

We may share personal information about you with: 

  * our agents, service providers and data processors who provide a service to us and you; and 
  * any person or business (and their advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on the same basis as us.) 



We will not pass your information to anyone outside ING Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described above, unless: 

  * we have your permission; 
  * we have to do so or are allowed to do so by law; 
  * we have a duty to the public to reveal the information; or 
  * our interests mean we must give the information - for example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason for giving information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes).
