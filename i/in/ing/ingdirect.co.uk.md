# ING Direct > Privacy Policy

**The information padlock signpost**  
The padlock symbol you see above is used on our site to alert users to the fact that their information will be collected at any given point. This privacy policy outlines the ways in which that data may be collected and used.

**A Word About Your Privacy**  
We respect your privacy. Not only do we respect it, but we also protect it. When you register to use the password protected areas of the site we will ask you for personal information about yourself. This information is only provided to those to whom you have authorised us to release information, or as required by legislation. This would include the financial institutions you've asked us to deal with, and specialised service providers (like the people who print our account statements). All of the above must meet our rigorous privacy standards. This policy does have a legal tone that reflects both the importance of the issue and it is consistent with recent Data Protection legislation. If you want more information regarding our privacy principles, please read on. If you have privacy questions or concerns, please contact Customer Services on 0845 603 8888.

**The Data Protection Act 1998**  
The Data Protection Act puts obligations on users of personal information and lays down principles for its use. One principle states that information has to be processed fairly and lawfully. This means that you're entitled to know how we intend to use any information you provide. You can then decide whether you want to give us that information. To provide the highest level of customer service we need accurate customer information. You can help by informing us whenever your circumstances change. You also have the right to request a copy of information that we hold about you in our records. Any request to obtain a copy of this information must be made in writing to the Data Protection Officer, ING Direct, 410 Thames Valley Park Drive, Reading, Berkshire RG6 1RH.
