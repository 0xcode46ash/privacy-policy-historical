The information we collect via this website may also include your IP address (this is your computer’s individual identification number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet) which is automatically logged by our web-server in the UK.  Unless we suspect fraud, we do not use your IP address to identify you personally.

**How we use your information and who we share it with**

**Keeping you informed**

You do not have to give us any personal information in order to use many of the pages of this website.  However, any information which you choose to give us through this website may be added to our marketing database and may be used by us for marketing our services and our events. 

It is possible that our marketing materials may contain input from other companies or organisations we are dealing with, but we DO NOT sell or give your details to any other companies for them to try to sell you their products or services. 

**Targeting our advertising**

Our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used to target our Internet advertisements which appear on other websites.  This means that the adverts will be selected based on the information we hold about you.  This allows us to improve the effectiveness of our advertising. 

**Statistical analysis**

The IP addresses (please see above for details) logged by our web-server and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used by us: 

  * to perform technical diagnosis of our website’s performance on a statistical basis; 
  * to analyse traffic data (so as to gauge interest in our website and to improve our understanding of our websites visitors’ behaviour and their response to our promotional campaigns); and 
  * to identify unusual transactions (in order to identify the source of fraudulent actions.) 



**Law enforcement & crime prevention**

We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating to our website users.  We will have no legal liability for disclosing information in these circumstances. 

**Other sharing of information**

We may share personal information about you with:

  * our agents, service providers and data processors who provide a service to us and you; and 
  * any person or business (and their advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on the same basis as us.) 



We will not pass your information to anyone outside ING Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described above, unless:

  * we have your permission; 
  * we have to do so or are allowed to do so by law; 
  * we have a duty to the public to reveal the information; or 
  * our interests mean we must give the information - for example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason for giving information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes). 



**Other websites**

This privacy policy is only intended to cover personal data collected through this website.  While we carefully select the websites which we link to, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the contents of these websites. 

Links to third party websites on the ING Direct Website are provided solely for your convenience. If you use these links, you leave the ING Direct Website. ING Direct has no control over the content of these websites or resources, or their availability, and ING Direct accepts no responsibility for them or for any loss or damage which may arise from your use of them. If you decide to access any of the third party websites linked to the ING Direct Website, you do so entirely at your own risk.
