# ING Direct > Privacy Policy

The privacy of our website users is important to us and we take care to safeguard it. This policy explains how we use such personal information as we may hold about you.

**Important information**

**Queries**  
If you have privacy questions which are not answered by this Website Privacy Policy or any other concerns about how we use your personal information, please write to us or contact Customer Services on 0845 603 8888.

**Changes**  
Our Website Privacy Policy is regularly reviewed to make sure that we continue to serve your privacy interests.  We reserve the right to modify or otherwise update this privacy policy and these changes will be posted on our website.  We encourage you to visit this page from time to time to ensure that you are aware of any changes we may have made.

** ** **Where we obtain your information from**

**Information volunteered by you**  
The information we collect via this website may include any personal details you type in and submit (such as your name, address, email address, etc.) and the contents of any correspondence you send to us. 

If you apply for any of our products or services, we may also obtain information about you from third parties which you agree we may contact, such as credit reference agencies.

**IP addresses**  
The information we collect via this website may also include your IP address (this is your computer’s individual identification number that is assigned to your computer when connected to the Internet) which is automatically logged by our web-server here in the UK.  Unless we suspect fraud, we do not use your IP address to identify you personally.

**Cookies & spotlight tags**  
This website also collects data which allows us to recognise you, your preferences and how you use this website. 

  * This information is collected by using temporary ‘session cookies’.  These are small strings of data stored in your device’s temporary memory when you navigate around the website but which are erased when you close your Web browser. 


  * This information is also collected by using spotlight tags (also known as ‘boom tags’, ‘clear GIFs’, ‘pixel tags’, ‘web beacons’ and ‘web bugs’).  These are small strings of code that are placed in the pages of our website which allow our advertising agents to store ‘persistent cookies’ in your Web browser’s cookie file when you access our website.  Unlike session cookies, these persistent cookies are not erased when you close your Web browser.



Our session cookies and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies do not store your email address or other such personal information.

**How we use your information and who we share it with**

**Processing applications and providing services to you**  
Information you provide to us when applying for and when using our products and services will be used and shared by us in the manner and for the purposes described at the time of your application. 

  * For example, we may share some of the information we hold about you with credit reference agencies, fraud prevention agencies and the people who print our account statements.  Information we share with credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also be used by third parties for various other purposes.


  * Further details of how your personal information is used are available on request or can be found on the product information pages of this website.



We also use the ‘session’ cookies employed in this website to enable you to move back and forth within a secure banking session and to save you re-entering information.

**Keeping you informed**  
You do not have to give us any personal information in order to use many of the pages of this website.  However, any information which you choose to give us via this website may be added to our marketing database and may be used by us for marketing our services and our events. 

It is possible that our marketing materials may contain input from other companies or organisations with whom we are dealing, but we DO NOT sell or give your details to any other companies who may try to sell you their products or services. 

**Targeting our advertising**  
Our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used to target our Internet advertisements which appear on other websites.  This allows us to improve the effectiveness of our advertising.

**Statistical analysis**  
The IP addresses logged by our web-server and our advertising agents’ persistent cookies used in combination with the spotlight tags employed in this website may be used by us:-

  * to perform technical diagnosis of our website’s performance on a statistical basis;


  * to analyse traffic data (so as to gauge interest in our website and to improve our understanding of our website’s visitors’ behaviour and their response to our promotional campaigns); and


  * to identify transactions that appear abnormal (in order to identify the source of fraudulent actions.)



**Law enforcement & crime prevention**  
We reserve the right to cooperate with law enforcement officials in the investigation of alleged unlawful activities of our website users or relating to our website users.  We will have no legal liability for such disclosures. 

If you provide false or inaccurate information and fraud is identified, details may be passed to fraud prevention agencies to prevent fraud and money laundering.

**Transfer outside the European Economic Area**  
To provide you with the services you ask for, ING Direct and our services providers may share your information with organisations outside the European Economic Area (which currently includes the European Union, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway).  We will not do this unless we are satisfied that your information will be processed as securely as if ING Direct were processing it.

**Other sharing of information**  
We may share personal information about you with:-

  * our agents, service providers and data processors who provide a service to us and you; and


  * any person or business (and their advisers) who might take over our rights or responsibilities under our agreement with you to allow them to prepare for taking these over (after that, we may also allow that person or business to use and share your information on the same basis as us.)



We will not pass your information to anyone outside ING Direct N.V. other than for the purposes described above, unless:

  * we have your permission;


  * we have to do so or are allowed to do so by law;


  * we have a duty to the public to reveal the information; or


  * our interests mean we must give the information - for example, to prevent fraud (we will not use this as a reason for giving information about you to anyone else for marketing purposes).



**Other websites**  
This privacy policy is only intended to cover personal data collected via this website.  While we carefully select the websites to which we link, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these websites.
