# InboxDollars - Earn CA$H for E-Mail, Surveys, Games, and More!

**Information Collected:**   
The following information is required to join InboxDollars: Name, Address, Phone Number, E-Mail Address, Username, and Password. Your name and address are required so that we can send payment to you. Your phone number and email address are required so that we are able to contact you. Username and password are required in order to provide you with restricted access to our Member's Section. 

In addition, the following information is required in order to receive your Signup Bonus: Birth Date, Gender, Marital Status, Education Completed, Household Income, and Children in Household. This information is used to send you targeted Advertisements that we believe you will be most interested in.

**Means of Collection:**   
Currently, the only way InboxDollars collects information is through our Signup Form. We do not acquire Members through purchase, co-registration, or any other means; however, we may do so at any time.

**Use of Information:**   
The information you provide is used only to contact you and to provide targeted Advertisements to you. InboxDollars does not share or sell your personal information with anyone, including our Advertisers.

**Co-Registration**   
In most circumstances, our Signup Form will include several co-registration advertisements. If you check any of the boxes (thereby "co-registering" for that Advertiser's web site, product, or service), your Personal Information is given to that Advertiser. The information provided to the Advertiser includes: your Name, Address, Phone Number, E-Mail Address, and IP Address. Please note that checking any of the co-registration boxes is completely optional.

**Cookies:**   
InboxDollars uses Cookies to track your Username and Password throughout our Web Site. We do this for several reasons:  
 **Recognition** \- you will not be required to login every time you visit our web site - you will be "remembered" between visits;  
 **Security** \- Because your Username and Password are stored in a Cookie, they are not displayed in the URL, which prevents someone walking by your computer from seeing this information. 

Cookies are 100% safe! Cookies are not used to invade your privacy in any way - they are simply used to provide better service to you. 

Please note that some Web Browser settings, as well as some software programs (such as Norton Internet Security and some Firewall Applications) may disable Cookies. **You will not be able to use InboxDollars.com without Cookies enabled!**

**Minimum Required Age:**   
In accordance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, Members must be at least 13 years old to participate in our program.

**Subject to Change:**   
As InboxDollars grows and expands, this Privacy Policy may change. InboxDollars reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. The Last Modification Date will always appear at the bottom of this page.
