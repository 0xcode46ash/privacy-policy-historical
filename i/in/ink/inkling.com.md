# Privacy within Inkling

Your privacy is important to us, so we’ve written a privacy policy that makes sense to everybody. Have a look, and if you have any questions or concerns, please drop us a line. We want you to enjoy Inkling with your friends and, at the same time, keep your personal information comfortably private.

So what’s personal information? It’s anything about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, Twitter account name, or phone number, that isn’t otherwise public information.

Obviously, we collect some personal information about you when you use Inkling. We know your name, your university, your e-mail address and sometimes even your credit card information and other sensitive info. We use this to do all sorts of things that you use within Inkling. Like when you buy a textbook, share your notes with friends, or make your notes available to others for sharing.

There’s some other information we’ll probably be recording that you didn’t type in yourself. For example, we’ll probably record your IP address, some information about which devices you’re using, which version of Inkling you’re running and other technical data. This data isn’t usually personal to you, but we associate it with your name, so it’s about you nonetheless.

We may also gather some information about what you’re doing when you use Inkling so we can help you better learn something. For example, we might know that you didn’t look at a specific movie, and when you’re getting related questions wrong, suggest that you go view it. This data is stored the device you’re using, such as an iPad, and shared with our servers so that you can also benefit from that data on other devices you’re using, such as an iPhone. That data is never shared with anyone else unless it’s anonymized and aggregated across many users, so nobody else will ever know what you’ve been doing. Not even your professor.

If you choose to share your personal information with your friends, that’s your choice. By default, only your first name and your last initial are visible to others. For example, Matt MacInnis, a student at Harvard, would be “Matt M. at Harvard.” People can find you using your e-mail address, but you’re offered the choice to disable this feature the first time you use Inkling, and you can turn it off whenever you’d like. You might also choose to make your photo and some other basic information available so that people can discover you and interact with you through Inkling.

Of course, we won’t sell or share your information with any third parties without your explicit permission. (Or a valid court order.) We will probably use your information to offer you some products from time to time. (For example, we might offer you a review kit for a title you already own.) But we won’t let third parties market to you, and we’ll always let you manage your communication preferences with us. And we’ll leave you alone the minute you ask us to.

Even our own employees are restricted from seeing your personal data. If they’ve got a legitimate reason to see it in the course of their jobs, they may get access. Otherwise, we’ve got electronic and physical safeguards to protect it.

And if we ever make any changes to this policy, we’ll notify you.

Thanks for using Inkling.
