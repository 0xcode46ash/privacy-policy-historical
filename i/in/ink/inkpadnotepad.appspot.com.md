Data We support the use of Secure Sockets Layer technology (“SSL”) encryption for data during

transmissions sent between the client app and the server. If you choose to use our services, we may store your electronic data on Google App Engine. Any of your data is stored by Google App Engine it shall be controlled by their terms of service (http://code.google.com/appengine/terms.html) and privacy policy (http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/).

Website Use Information Similar to most commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. A cookie is a very small data document, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a part of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. When you log onto and browse our website, our website server automatically receives and records information on our website server logs from your browser, which may include, but is not limited to your IP address, cookie, page(s) viewed, the date and time of visits, time spent at our website, and websites visited just before and just after our website. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. You have the option to reject cookies through your web browser, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of the services' features.

Our website uses cookies to differentiate you from other users and to improve your user experience (for example, by enabling you to log in fewer times than would otherwise be required). In addition, cookies, in conjunction with our server's log files, allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our website and which parts of the site are more popular. This helps us gather feedback in order to constantly improve our website and better serve our customers.

We use analytics within our mobile application and website for visibility purposes, to track how many times the application was opened and the pages viewed within the application. Analytics may track your course location. Should this occur, your location will be anonymous and not linked to your personal information. This tracking is similar to the data collected from your internet internet connection through cookies.

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Some third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

Workpail or a third party tracking utility company may employ a software technology called tracking pixels, that help us better manage content on our site and emails by informing us what content is effective. Tracking Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, tracking pixels are embedded invisibly in emails and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by tracking pixels to our customers' personally identifiable information. If you do not wish to re receive tracking pixels, you must disable HTML images in your email client, but that may affect your ability to view images in other emails which you receive.

HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION We use information which we collect for purposes of providing the services, auditing, research and analysis in order to maintain, protect and improve our services, ensuring the functioning of our servers, providing customer service, contacting you as described in this Privacy Policy, and to enable features of the services, such as to allow you to share data with others, and developing new products and services for our customers and prospective customers.
