# Privacy Policy

**Ink Technologies** respects your privacy and recognizes your right to protection of all personal information you share with us, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, etc.

**Our bottom line privacy policy is simple: we never share your e-mail address or other information with anyone, or use your information for any reason except to contact you when your order ships.**

You are welcome to visit InkTechnologies.com anonymously. Personal information is only collected if you place an order. We do not link your IP address to any personally identifiable information.

### Limited information gathering

Like most commercial web sites, InkTechnologies.com uses cookies so we can better serve you with tailored information. Cookies are small text identifiers sent to your computer to facilitate optimal customer experience and subsequent visits. Most browsers let you define preferences to notify you when you are sent cookies and let you decide whether to accept or reject them. Virtually all browsers let you remove cookies from your computer.

Cookies cannot retrieve information from your computer, spread viruses, or capture your email address. Ink Technologies uses cookies responsibly; our cookies are never spyware; nor are they used in any malicious manner. We, specifically, use them to assist in our Google remarketing ad campaign to display relevant ads across the Internet and when you return to InkTechnologies.com - when you create an account and log-in, to maintain a shopping session.

### Advertising

Ink Technologies does not sell or distribute any personal identifying information about your shopping experience. We do not serve any advertisements for other products or companies, from our site; nor will we contact you on behalf of any other company. We participate in Google's trusted remarketing program, which helps target ads, across the Internet, to your relevant shopping interests.

If you do not feel comfortable being part of Google's remarketing program, you can opt out of Google's 'use of cookies' by visiting their [Ads Preferences Manager](https://www.google.com/ads/preferences/). Alternatively, you can opt out of any third-party vendor's 'use of cookies' by visiting the [Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

### Security

Ink Technologies takes all appropriate and reasonable steps to protect all information you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. No credit card information is stored online.

### Commitment
