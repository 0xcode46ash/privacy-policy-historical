**The York Newspaper Company is committed to protecting the privacy of our customers. The following statement discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the inyork.com Web site. **

**What personally identifiable information does InYork.com collect from me?**

InYork.com collects information in several ways. Some personal information is gathered through server log files. Personal information is also gathered when you enter a contest or promotion, request vacation delivery stop, or when you post an online ad. During these instances, InYork.com asks for information such as your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, phone number, subscriber status, and credit card number. We may also ask you for other information at other times. Whenever we collect information about you, we will make an effort to link to our privacy policy. 

**How is my information used?**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a customized experience. InYork.com uses information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our Web site, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics. InYork.com may share this aggregated data with advertisers or business partners. 

InYork.com also uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about you.
