# INVESCO Funds: Contact Us, Forms, Site Map, Search and Trouble Shooting

INVESCO Funds is committed to protecting your personal and financial data. We collect non-public information about you from applications and other forms you complete, as well as transactions that we perform on your behalf, for your accounts. This information allows us to provide service for your accounts and provide you with information when you request it.  
  
We do not sell your personal information to outside companies for purposes of selling their products and services to you. As permitted by law, we may share all of this information with our affiliates, as well as with third parties who perform marketing services on our behalf, or with whom we have joint marketing agreements, such as your own broker-dealer, fulfillment vendors, market researchers, customer survey companies and technology developers. We also provide this information to third parties who assist us in maintaining your accounts with us, or who process transactions for your accounts.  
  
We restrict access to your non-public personal information to those employees who need to know that information to provide service for your accounts. Furthermore, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your non-public personal information.  
  
Additional information specific to our Web site, invescofunds.com, is detailed below.  
  
Special Privacy Considerations  
  
INVESCO's general privacy policies apply to invescofunds.com. Here is some additional information that applies to invescofunds.com.  
  
Invescofunds.com utilizes a cookie for all customers who visit our site. If you wish to visit the different businesses within AMVESCAP, you may access them through the About INVESCO section of our site, or by entering their respective URL.  
  
When you complete an online application form, we collect demographic and personal bank account details about you in order to set up your account. Your session ID is collected and stored in a cookie that expires after each user session, or after 20 minutes of inactivity. Bank information is encrypted for this session and is stored only on our server, not in a cookie. When you complete a transaction online, this information is collected and stored in a cookie that also expires.  
  
Areas of our site contain links to other Web sites that we hope will be of value to you. Depending upon the configuration of your browser, utilizing such links may provide those other Web sites with personal information about you, including the fact that you have visited invescofunds.com. Please note that INVESCO and invescofunds.com do not have any control over content or privacy practices of these sites. We urge you to review the privacy policies of these sites before providing personal information, and, if you have concerns, consider reconfiguring your browser so that cookies are not permitted.  
  
Technical Information  
  
Whenever you submit personal identifiable or financially identifiable information through invescofunds.com, you will be doing so through a secure server.  
  
This secure server software encrypts your personal information. When you press the secure login button, your information is encrypted and sent, via Secure Socket Layering (SSL), to invescofunds.com. This encryption process occurs even though the page where the login ID and password are entered is not SSL encrypted. Once our secure server receives your encrypted personal information, it is translated back into its original form and verified. All information collected is stored on our internal databases/servers, which are physically secure and inaccessible from the Internet.  
  
Invescofunds.com only allows secure browser access to the secure areas of our site. The browser's "secure mode" is in place only when it is needed â€” when you are submitting an application, using our Contact Us page, or if you are in Your Account. You will be able to tell you are in a secure mode when your browser displays a special icon on the lower bar of your browser window. Specifically:  
  
| 

In Netscape 4.x and higher and Microsoft Internet Explorer, you will see a picture of a closed lock.  
  
| 

The Web site address will start with "https" instead of "http."  
  
Every secure page on invescofunds.com has been verified with a digital certificate issued by Secure Server Certification Authority. This is shown via the "site certificate" that is displayed on all secure pages. To view this certificate, click on the image of the closed lock on the bottom bar of your browser window. A small frame displaying site security information will pop up.
