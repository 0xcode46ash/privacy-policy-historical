Privacy Policy  
  
**Effective: January 1, 2008**

**1 GENERAL**  
Invite Media, Inc., a company headquartered in the United States ("Invite Media"), is the provider of the services described below, based on Bid Manager™. Bid Manager utilizes "cookies," data records that specify an ad or a group of ads that are meant to be displayed to a user in the future. Bid Manager utilizes standard "cookies" (or such other technical formats that may become available in the future). 

This privacy statement covers the Web site [www.invitemedia.com](http://www.invitemedia.com/).

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [privacy@invitemedia.com](mailto:privacy@invitemedia.com).

**2 WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?**  
Invite Media collects personally identifiable information (PII) in the Jobs and homepage sections, such as personal name, company name and e-mail address. The information that Invite Media servers records is for reply only and is later on erased with no further use. Invite Media does not match any of the cookies-based data with other data in an attempt to identify a user and thus we will NEVER KNOW the identity of a user. If for any reason a user wishes to update/correcting their PII in the contact us section, please resubmit your contact information or send email to [contact@invitemedia.com](mailto:contact@invitemedia.com). 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site. 

**As a matter of policy, Invite Media does not set any cookies based on adult related searches or adult content**. Although some of the data contained in the cookies generated on a user’s hard drive is also written to the Invite Media database, this is done **solely in an aggregate form** , for reporting and accounting purposes with Invite Media's clients. Invite Media does not obtain or maintain separate data for a given user on its servers. 

**What are cookies?** Cookies are small text files that web servers typically send to users’ computer when they visit a website. Cookies are stored as text files on users’ hard drive, and can be accessed by web servers when the user returns to a website or goes to another website. Cookies are used by companies to collect and send information about a user’s website visit – for example, number of visits, average time spent, pages viewed, navigation history through the website, and other statistics. This information helps companies improve a user’s online experience in many ways: for example, by allowing companies to monitor website performance, make the website easier to use, measure the effectiveness of their promotional placements, and tailor their website to better match a user’s interests and preferences. **Cookies cannot be used to access any other data on a user’s hard drive, or to personally identify them**. Users who prefer not to accept cookies can set their Internet browser to notify them when they receive a cookie or to prevent cookies from being placed on their hard drive. 

Some of our Publishers and Networks may place their own cookies on a user’s hard drive outside of the Invite Media service, however Invite Media has no access to or control over these cookies. For more details go to the OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTORS section. 

**3\. INFORMATION SHARING**   
As described above, Invite Media stores only aggregated data on its servers. We may share such aggregate, non-personal information with Publishers and Networks in connection with reporting and accounting needs as well as with other unaffiliated third parties for various purposes such as statistical or educational analysis.

Also, in the event Invite Media is merged into another company, or another company acquires all or substantially all of Invite Media’s assets, including, without limitation, in the event of bankruptcy, all data compiled or owned by Invite Media may be among the items transferred in that transaction. In such event, all the data will continue to be governed by this Policy. 

**4 HOW IS OUR INFORMATION SECURED AND PROTECTED?**  
All of the user data collected by Invite Media is stored only in aggregate form, meaning that information about a specific user cannot be retrieved. Even so, we maintain physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to protect all our data from accidental, unauthorized or unlawful access, use, modification, disclosure, loss, or destruction. The data is kept on a secure server and we restrict access to the data solely to authorized users. No security measures, however thorough, are perfect and there can be no absolute assurance of security and therefore, we cannot and do not offer an absolute guarantee or warrant the security of the information we possess. 

**5 CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE**  
The services of Invite Media are not intended for persons under 13 years of age. Invite Media’s products and services are not developed or directed at children. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any personally identifiable information including not from children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly market our products or services to children under the age of 13.

We may revise this Policy at any time. Any changes and/or updates to the Policy will be updated directly on this page[](http://www.exelate.com/privacypolicy.html). We encourage you to visit this page periodically to review our current Policy so that you will always know what information we gather and how we may use that information.
