# InvestorPlace.com: Privacy Policy

At _InvestorPlace.com_ , we take the privacy and security of our registered users and subscribers seriously. We are committed to protecting the personal information you choose to share with us. Accordingly, we have adopted the following privacy policy, based on the principles of notice, choice, access and security in the collection and use of all information regarding our customers and their activities at _InvestorPlace_ and our related sites. 

**_What infomation do we collect?_**

At InvestorPlace we collect two types of information from our registered users and subscribers: 

1\. site usage data  
2\. registration and subscription data 

**Site usage data** is information we collect to measure how our registered users and customers use _InvestorPlace_ and our related sites. From time to time, _InvestorPlace_ may perform statistical analyses of aggregate user behavior, but they are not based on any personal information that you provide, nor are they personally identifiable. These analyses allow us to measure your interest in our site, and help us in several key areas. The most important of these are: 

  * Improving our web content 
  * Enhancing your experience while visiting the site 
  * Customizing the content and/or layout of our pages 
  * Providing services required by individual users 
  * Developing new products based on your needs 

**_What are "cookies"? How do we use them?_**

Like many other commercial sites, _InvestorPlace_ utilizes a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a web site recognize you as a previous visitor and thus save and remember any preferences that you may have set (including remembering your password if desired). A cookie cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on a computer virus or capture your e-mail address. Cookies on our site may collect your domain name and track your selections through our web pages. 

We only use "cookies" to gather the information indicated in this policy and do not use cookies to gather personal information about you without your consent. We may disclose this information, in aggregate form only, to third parties including advertisers or potential advertisers. _DoubleClick_ , the organization that delivers advertising to our site, uses cookies from _InvestorPlace_ to collect information for tracking purposes. None of this information can be associated with you personally. You may always disable cookies from being set by changing your browser preferences. (See Advertising section below for a further description of _DoubleClick's_ information collection practices and how you may opt-out.) 

**_What about advertising?_**

_InvestorPlace_ features several services that are co-sponsored by other web sites. One example of such a feature is the portfolio registration and quote service. Additionally, our site contains links to other web sites, including those of advertisers. While these co-sponsored activities, banner ads and links originate on _InvestorPlace_ , we do not operate them. For example, if you click on a link or banner advertisement, that click takes you out of _InvestorPlace_ to either the service or ad provider's site. These other sites may use cookies, collect data, or solicit personal information from you. Since we do not have control over the privacy practices or the content of these sites, we recommend that you check their privacy policies before giving out any personal information. _InvestorPlace_ does not own, control, have access to, or maintain any information collected by our co-sponsors or advertisers. 

_InvestorPlace_ also partners with _DoubleClick_ to provide you with advertisements we believe will add value to your service. In the course of delivering an ad to you, _DoubleClick_ does not collect any personal information about you, such as your name, address, phone number or email address. _DoubleClick_ does, however, use cookies (see above for a discussion of "cookies") to collect information that cannot be associated with you personally. This information includes the server your computer is logged onto, your browser type (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer), and whether you responded to the ad delivered. The collection of this information is commonly referred to as "tracking." _DoubleClick_ uses this information for the purpose of targeting meaningful ads and measuring ad effectiveness on behalf of _InvestorPlace_. For more information regarding the methods and technology used to collect this information, how _DoubleClick_ uses it, who gets access to it and what measures are taken to secure the data obtained, please view _DoubleClick's_ privacy policy found at <http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy>. 

_DoubleClick_ also conducts statistical analyses that help us determine the value of the ads we provide to you. _InvestorPlace_ may share this aggregate information with advertisers or potential advertisers. You can opt-out of _DoubleClick_ tracking by clicking the following link: <http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy>. (Scroll down to the middle of the page and click on the "opt-out" graphic.) Doing so will opt you out of all tracking conducted by _DoubleClick_ for your browser. If you surf through other browsers or on other machines, you will have to set this option there as well. So, if you use multiple browsers (AOL, Netscape, Internet Explorer, etc.) you should repeat this procedure with each one. Similarly, if you connect to the web from multiple machines (e.g. work and home) you need to explicitly opt-out from each browser on each machine. 

_InvestorPlace's_ privacy policy does not extend to anything that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond our control, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to current law or government regulation. 

**Registration and subscription data** is the only personally identifiable information that _InvestorPlace_ seeks about you. This information includes your e-mail address and, in some cases, your name, mailing address, telephone number or fax number. 

We collect your **e-mail address** as part of the _InvestorPlace_ registration process, or when you place an order through InvestorPlace. We use it to send you investment information and timely financial news. From time to time, we will also send you additional information including special offers from _InvestorPlace_ or specially selected partners. If you are a subscriber to our investment newsletters, you will receive information regarding your newsletter author's site. Our Client Relations representatives may also contact you if they have any questions about your subscription or service. 

We neither rent nor sell your email address to anyone. Though we hope you gain value from the messages you receive, you can choose to opt-out of receiving further messages by following the instructions provided at the close of each e-mail. You may also opt-out of receiving future messages by e-mailing your request to [phillipsunsub@phillips.com](mailto:phillipsunsub@phillips.com). We collect your **postal address** as part of the order process. We use it to send you the free special reports you have requested, newsletters that you have purchased and special offers from _Phillips International, Inc._ Occasionally, we may provide the names and postal mailing addresses of our subscribers to carefully screened companies who offer products, services, or information which we believe may be of interest to you. You may "opt-out" of receiving this information by e-mailing us at [phillipsunsub@phillips.com](mailto:phillipsunsub@phillips.com) or by sending a copy of your mailing label to _Phillips Investment Resources_ , 7811 Montrose Rd., Potomac MD 20854, _Attention: Subscription Services_. Any other information you provide us, such as your **fax or telephone number** , is collected by us only to fulfill subscription orders that you have purchased or to contact you about your service. 

**_What happens when you order through InvestorPlace?_**

When you order a free report or purchase a newsletter service, we will request certain personal information, including your name, postal address, daytime and evening telephone numbers, credit card number (where applicable) and e-mail address. _InvestorPlace_ may supply some of this information to third parties for the twin purposes of administering and fulfilling your order. Individuals who do not have a Visa, MasterCard, Discover or American Express credit card are not permitted to make purchases online. 

When you order a free report from _InvestorPlace_ , you are given specific instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future e-mail alerts and other investment-oriented offers and information. All e-mails sent to you from _InvestorPlace_ will also contain specific instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future messages. Receiving these e-mails is entirely your choice. 

When you purchase a newsletter or other service through _InvestorPlace_ , you will receive relevant bulletins from your newsletter author, announcements of new web-content, and information on new services provided by your newsletter author. We may also use your e-mail address to contact you with questions about your subscription or service, or to remind you of your site password, if necessary. 

Your personal information is not shared with third parties other than as described above. 

**_How can you be sure that your information is secure?_**

We take the security of your personal information quite seriously, and are constantly improving our efforts to protect it. However, no electronic communication over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secured. Though we take great care to protect your personal information, _InvestorPlace_ cannot warrant the security of any information that you submit to us, and you do so at your own risk. We do not share your credit card number with other parties, other than those involved with the administration of your subscription. We do not share other information except as described in this policy. 

If any unauthorized use of your credit card occurs as a result of your credit card purchase from _InvestorPlace_ , simply notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures. If, through no fault of your own, your credit card company finds credit card fraud but does not waive your entire liability for unauthorized charges, we will reimburse you for the remaining liability, up to a maximum of fifty U.S. dollars ($50.00) per card. You can also take steps to secure your personal information. When you are finished at _InvestorPlace_ , sign off the _InvestorPlace_ site and close your browser window. This helps to ensure that someone else cannot pose as you online. This is especially important if you are at a computer that is accessible to others at a public place, such as a library, a school, or your office. 

**_How can you use the information found at InvestorPlace?_**

We grant our users the right to download, store, or output materials from our site, for their personal use only. Materials may not be reproduced in ANY edited form. Any other reproduction, transmission, performance, display or editing of these materials by any means, mechanical or electronic, without the express written permission of Phillips Investment Resources is strictly prohibited. Users wishing to obtain permission to reprint or reproduce any materials appearing on _InvestorPlace_ may contact us at [permissions@phillips.com](mailto:permissions@phillips.com). All contents of _InvestorPlace_ and related sites are copyrighted by Phillips International, Incorporated. 

**_What happens in the event of a merger or acquisition?_**

Phillips Investment Resources is a dynamic investment advisory service. As our business continues to develop and grow, it is possible that we might sell or buy other publishers, advisory services, products or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Phillips Investment Resources, or a substantial part all of its assets (including InvestorPlace.com) are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
