# Privacy Policy — Investing Daily

Your privacy concerns are important to us. We’ve created this statement in order to fully demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices that we use when you’re visiting our Web site.

**E-mail Address**  
Your e-mail address is unique and when linked to your subscription, gives an added level of security when you access your account. We do not collect your e-mail address unless you specifically provide it to us.

When you register online, we offer a selection of e-mail preferences and services from which you may choose the type of e-mail you would prefer to receive. Preferences include market updates, free e-zines, service-related matters, special offers relating to your subscription, special offers from the publisher and sometimes offers from affiliate companies that we believe may be of interest to you.

You may modify your selections at anytime from the Subscriber Services section of the Web site via the “My Account” link. Additionally, every promotional e-mail we send includes a way for you to opt out of receiving similar messages in the future.

**Postal Address**  
If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about new products and services or upcoming events. You may also receive postal mailings from other reputable organizations that offer products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority.

**Telephone Numbers**  
It’s very rare that we might contact you by telephone. But we may do so if we have a question about your order or if we discover an opportunity that may interest you. We do not rent your telephone number to other organizations.
