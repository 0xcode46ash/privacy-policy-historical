# Privacy Policy — Investing Daily

Your privacy is important to us. We’ve created this statement in order to fully demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices that we use when you’re visiting the Investing Daily network of websites.

**What information does Investing Daily collect?**  
Investing Daily collects two types of personally identifiable user information: 1.) information you choose to provide, and 2.) information collected during interaction with our network of websites, postal mailings and emails.

Information you choose to provide includes all information you submit for the purposes of signing up to receive Investing Daily email newsletters, special offers, print or electronic subscriptions, and website comments or surveys. This information may include your name, email address, telephone number, postal address, payment information or user names and passwords.

Online browsing information may be collected as you interact with our network of websites and through the use of “cookies.” A cookie is a data file that is stored on your computer when you visit certain websites that can be used to improve your online experience. We use cookies in our network of websites to authenticate your user name and password and to maintain the login for the duration of your visit. We may, from time to time, also use cookies on our network of websites to provide you with customized content or unique offers that we believe will be of interest to you. We also collect information on how users access and browse the Investing Daily network of websites. This information is often not personally identifiable but provides us with statistical data about user engagement including, but not limited to, duration of visit, pages visited, unique and repeat visits, etc. From any emails sent by Investing Daily, we may collect information about email delivery and recipient behavior, such as whether or not you received an email we sent you, if it was opened, any links were clicked and their resulting URL.

**How does Investing Daily use this information?**  
The information collected is used to provide you with the products and services you have requested. We also use this information to administer our websites, improve email delivery and assess aggregated user engagement. In addition, by subscribing to a free or paid email newsletter from Investing Daily, or any of our other products or services, you agree to receive special offers and marketing messages, which may also include trial or free subscriptions to other products provided by Investing Daily. In accordance with the federal CAN-SPAM Act, you are welcome to customize your experience, or opt out of receiving messages from Investing Daily altogether, by clicking on the “email preferences” link included in any email we send you.

We may also send CAN-SPAM compliant messages or advertisements on behalf of third-party advertisers to anyone who signs up or subscribes to any of our services. At no time do we sell or transfer your personally identifiable information to third-party advertisers unless you specifically request information from them. You may opt out of receiving third-party messages through the “email preferences” link included in any email we send you.

If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about new products and services or upcoming events. You may also receive postal mailings from other reputable organizations that offer products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority. If you have provided us with a telephone number, it’s very rare that we might contact you, but we may do so if we have a question about your order or if we discover an opportunity that may interest you. We do not rent your telephone number to other organizations.

**Do we share your information?**  
Investing Daily will not disclose any personally identifiable information about individual users except as described in this Privacy Policy. We may employ contractors or other third parties who provide certain services for us including subscription fulfillment, email delivery and management of online surveys. In such circumstances, limited information may be shared only to the extent necessary to provide these services. We may provide advertisers with non-identifiable email behavior information on an aggregated basis, including open rates and click tracking information. If Investing Daily or any part thereof is sold, merged or acquired, any user information may be transferred to one or more successor entities. In such an event, subscribers and registered users will be notified of any change in ownership, acquisition or merger.

**Sponsors, advertisers and links**  
The Investing Daily network of websites may provide links to third-party websites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. If you follow links from our sites to others, you should be aware that you are doing business with those other websites, which may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those parties and websites. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.

**Children’s Privacy**  
We do not provide products or services intended for children under the age of 13. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we do not intentionally collect personally identifiable information from children. In the event that we learn we have collected personal information about a child, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
Your use of the Investing Daily network of websites, and any disputes arising from it, is subject to this Privacy Policy and the Investing Daily Terms and Conditions notice. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time by notice to you via email or postal mail, or by posting any modifications to an Investing Daily website (which shall be considered constructive notice). Your continued use of any Investing Daily website following notice of any modification to this Policy shall be considered an acceptance of all such modifications. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information we have about you and your account.
