# Privacy Policy

Your privacy concerns are important to us. We've created this statement in order to fully demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices that we use when you're visiting our Web site.  


 **E-mail Address**  
Your e-mail address is unique and when linked to your subscription, gives an added level of security when you access your account. We do not collect your e-mail address unless you specifically provide it to us.

When you register online, we offer a selection of e-mail preferences and services from which you may choose the type of e-mail you would prefer to receive. Preferences include market updates, free e-zines, service-related matters, special offers relating to your subscription, special offers from the publisher and sometimes offers from affiliate companies that we believe may be of interest to you. 

You may modify your selections at anytime from the Subscriber Services section of the Web site. Additionally, every promotional e-mail we send includes a way for you to opt out of receiving similar messages in the future.

 **Postal Address**  
If you supply us with your postal address, you may receive periodic mailings from us with information about new products and services or upcoming events. You may also receive postal mailings from other reputable organizations that offer products and services that we think may be of interest to you. Outside of these organizations, we will not disclose any information unless required to do so by law or other regulatory authority.

 **Telephone Numbers**  
We'll only contact you by telephone if we have a question about your order. We do not make your telephone number available to other organizations.

This Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites, other companies may collect personally identifiable information about you. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of those parties and Web sites.
