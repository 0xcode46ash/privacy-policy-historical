_Investment U_ takes individual privacy very seriously. We are also aware of the threats to your security and privacy on the Internet. Please take a few moments to review the steps that _Investment U_ takes to ensure your privacy and security while giving you the best possible customer service as you use our web sites.

**Cookies**

_InvestmentU.com_ sometimes uses cookies to store and track User information. Cookies enable _InvestmentU.com_ to personalize the viewing experience of a User on the _InvestmentU.com_. When the User revisits _InvestmentU.com_ , _InvestmentU.com_ can recognize the User by the cookie and customize the User’s experience at _InvestmentU.com_ accordingly. For example, _InvestmentU.com_ uses cookies to recognize User access privileges on _InvestmentU.com_ , track Site usage and traffic patterns, add advertisements for goods or services of interest, and estimate  _InvestmentU.com_ ‘s audience size.

Although most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies, if you prefer, a User may decline the placement of a cookie on his or her hard drive by using the appropriate feature(s) of one’s web browser software (if available) to delete the cookie. Users should understand, however, that certain areas within the _InvestmentU.com_ may not function properly if the web browser will not accept cookies.

In addition, advertisers that serve ads onto _InvestmentU.com_ may also use their own cookies.

**Submitting Data**

At no time are you required to submit personal information to access any area of the _The Investment U_ site. Visitors to our other sites are asked to submit a log-on name and password to visit Subscriber Only sections of the sites. This is to ensure you can receive the services you are paying for.

**Ordering Online**

Any data you submit to us through an online order form is transferred to us via a Secure Sockets Layer – an encryption protocol – and is kept in databases that cannot be accessed from outside our firewall. 

In other words, any data you send us is encrypted, so in the unlikely event a hacker intercepts your data, it cannot be easily read. Our firewall is a mechanism that prevents access to our servers by anyone outside of the company.

_Investment U_ does not sell or rent your name to anyone. That means that only authorized employees of _Investment U_ ever have access to any information you submit. We may use your name and address to send you information on other _Investment U_ products that may suit your interests. And, although we disagree with it, we must turn over any pertinent information to any law enforcement agency that takes the proper steps to require it. 

If at any time you wish to be removed from our mailing list, please [click here](http://www.investmentu.com/contactus.html) to contact our customer service department.

**E-mail**

If you subscribe to _The Investment U E-Letter_ , your name and e-mail address will be placed in a database. As with all other personal information, only employees of _Investment U_ have access to this data. We do not give _Investment U_ addresses to outside companies.

Any e-mail you send to _Investment U_ is completely confidential. We will not add your name to our e-mail list without your permission. For security reasons, if your inquiry is about one of your subscriptions, we may ask you to submit some additional information only to verify your identity. Remember, in this case we are only asking you to confirm information you have already given us.
