## INTRODUCTION

Align Technology, Inc. and its affiliates (“ **Align** ”, " **we** ", " **us** " and " **ours** ") are committed to protecting your information (in this Privacy Statement, “information” refers to the personally identifiable information, considered personal data, that you provide or we collect on, about, or from you through our websites).

Align designs, manufacturers and markets the Invisalign® system and iTero® intra-oral scanners and OrthoCAD services. The following discloses how we collect, use and share the information we gather on our websites (the " **Sites** ").

In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may seek information from you, about yourself or someone you know, such as name, email address and/or home address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect such personal information from you on the Internet and to get your consent to process such information where required.

By using our Sites, you consent to our collection, use, disclosure, transfer and processing of personal data in accordance with this Privacy Statement.

On occasions you may choose to provide us with personal data about other people so that, for example, we can contact them with information about us. You must only share their personal data with us if you have obtained their consent and permission to do so.

## Children’s Privacy

At Align, we do not intend to collect any information from children under the age of thirteen (13), unless the information is collected from a parent or guardian. While we cannot stop a child from accessing the Sites, we do not collect any personal information without making it clear that the person providing the information must be at least 13 years old. If you have questions about our Sites collecting information from children, please contact us at [Privacy@aligntech.com](mailto:Privacy@aligntech.com).

Please note that the age threshold mentioned above may vary depending on applicable legal requirements in your country. If this is the case, we will indicate it accordingly at the time of collection.

## Links to other sites

Our Sites may contain links to other websites merely as a convenience. Align is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites, and inclusion of links does not mean we endorse the information or company. This means that if you connect to another site through our Sites, we are not responsible for and we cannot control what they do with your information.

Also, you may have the opportunity to share your information with other websites, such as social media sites. We may provide a convenient link to let you do this easily, but we are not responsible for and we cannot control their website or your posts/sharing. You are encouraged to review the privacy policies and information collection practices of these other websites and social media sites.

## Marketing and Do Not Contact

We may send you information about us from time to time if you have given us your consent (where required).

Align provides you the opportunity to request to stop receiving electronic communications from either Align or our partners by withdrawing your consent.

You may also use the convenient unsubscribe feature included with emails. Please allow us enough time to process your request. 

Keep in mind, this withdrawal of consent does not apply to necessary communications, such as responding to an inquiry, and is revoked if you later request information from us, for example, if you sign up to receive news alerts from us.
