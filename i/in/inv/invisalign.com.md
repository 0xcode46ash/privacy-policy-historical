## Privacy policy

The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for our Internet sites, www.invisalign.com, www.aligntech.com, and for our partners' sites.

At Align Technology, we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information. In general, you can visit Align Technology on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. There are times, however, when we may need information from you, or you may choose to provide information of a friend or acquaintance, such as name, e-mail address and/or home address. It is our intent to let you know before we collect such personal information from you on the Internet and to obtain your prior permission for its collection and use.

### What we do with the information we gather and track

The information gathered from you, or provided by you in any forms you fill out may be used in one of four ways:

\- To provide you with information about products, services, news and events.   
\- To allow you to use, purchase, and/or download products and services.

\- To provide certified doctors with information on actual or prospective patients.

If you tell us that you do not wish to have this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes. We do keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it.

### Contests
