### How We Gather Information From You

Our collection of information depends on the page(s) you visit, the services you chose, and the activities you elect to participate in. We may gather information in ways other than listed here as our technology progresses.

Cookies  
This site requires the use of browser cookies. Cookies are messages written in your browser. The messages store information so that our site immediately recognizes you each time you visit. This permits us to personalize our site for each member, allow access to the secure parts of our site that individual members have registered for and provide members with up-to-date information about their own account.

Log Files  
We use cookies to store visitor preferences, record session information, such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

Clear Gifs  
Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier. We employ this technology exclusively for page formatting. We do not use it to track online movements of users.

### Sharing

Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law where we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

Aggregate Information  
We may use Aggregated Information to identify things such as usage patterns and popularity of certain features on investors.com. We may share Aggregated Information with our sister companies.

Third Parties May Receive or Collect Information Through IBD  
We use a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. This company will also perform a card authorization and fraud check, but this company does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We use a third-party ad serving company, 24/7 Real Media, Inc. to serve certain advertisements to you when you visit this Web site. Our third-party ad serving company may use anonymous information related to your visit to the Service's Web site to better provide advertisements to you about goods and services that may be of interest to you. Our third-party ad serving company does not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number. However, they do receive your USER ID in order to facilitate their service.

IBD Forums  
We offer our users the option of participating in the IBD Forums, discussion boards. Separate registration is required prior to accessing this service. Any information you disclose when posting a message in these Forums may become public. For more information about IBD Forums see [IBD Forums Rules, Policies and Disclaimers](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204024141id_/http://www.investors.com/terms/forumrules.asp).

Choice/Opt-out  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes of us sending them offers of interest. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive promotional materials from us or our sister company DGO, may opt-out of receiving these communications by accessing their member profile found on our Web site and they may then select to 'opt-out' or by sending us an email at www.askibd.com. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.

Supplementation of Information with Affiliates  
In order to properly fulfill our obligations to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. Also, in order us to enhance our ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our sister company DGO, to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from either of these two companies, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences.

Special Offers  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username, in addition, members who subscribe to our service will also receive an e-mail each time their subscription is renewed. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, or a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.

Site and Service Updates  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [What is SSL?](https://web.archive.org/web/20041204024141id_/http://www.investors.com/privacy/ssl.asp) While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access this information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [askibd1@investors.com](mailto:askibd1@investors.com).

Correction/Updating Personal Information  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire to use our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done by accessing you're my Profile on our Web site.

Personal Information You Disclose  
Please remember that if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information on our site, such as in IBD Forums, it becomes public information and you should exercise caution. This means that your information may be viewed and/or collected and used by third parties without our or your knowledge. Such actions are not under our control and we are not responsible for events arising from your voluntary posting of personal identifiable information board.

Children  
IBD and its affiliates do not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13. If such a situation is discovered, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe IBD has any information about or from a child under 13, please contact us at [askibd1@investors.com](mailto:askibd1@investors.com).

Changes to our Privacy Policy  
These guidelines are subject to change. All changes will be posted on this page. If the changes are significant we will notify registered users by email. We encourage you to review our privacy policy periodically to remain informed of changes that may have occurred.
