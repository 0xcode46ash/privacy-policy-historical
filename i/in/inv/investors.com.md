Communication via Email  
IBD reserves the right to send transactional messages and business relationship messages via email to facilitate agreed upon transactions or update customers about existing business relationships. Such emails include, but are not limited to, welcome emails to verify password and username, transaction receipts, billing notification, renewal notices, notification of activation of online privileges, technical support responses, and other communications required to service customers’ accounts on investors.com and/or customers’ subscriptions with IBD or our sister company DGO. Customers cannot unsubscribe from these email messages. IBD, and our sister company DGO, also make various one-time emails and email series available to our customers to help them get the most out of their subscriptions. Such emails include, but are not limited to, newsletters, product updates, educational materials, surveys, special offers from IBD and/or DGO as well as special offers of interest from carefully selected 3rd parties. Customers may choose to subscribe to or unsubscribe from any or all of these email communications at will. From time to time, IBD and our sister company DGO may create new email series to add value and improve our customers’ experience. Customers will automatically be subscribed to new email series as they become available. If they so choose, customers may unsubscribe from these new email series as well.

Subscribing to and Unsubscribing from Email  
With the exception of those transactional and business relationship emails mentioned above, customers may subscribe to or unsubscribe from any or all email messages from IBD and/or our sister company DGO.

Supplementation of Information with Affiliates  
In order to properly fulfill our obligations to our customers, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. Also, in order us to enhance our ability to tailor the site to an individual's preference, we combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our sister company DGO, to create a personalized user profile. When a user makes a purchase from either of these two companies, the companies collect and share that purchase information with us so we can tailor the site to our users' preferences.

Site and Service Updates  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

Security  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: [What is SSL?](https://web.archive.org/privacy/ssl.asp) While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use passwords to access this information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [askibd1@investors.com](mailto:askibd1@investors.com).

Phishing  
Phishing is a term used to describe a type of Internet scam in which inauthentic emails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you.

The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: [www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm](http://www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm)

Please know that Investor’s Business Daily takes the privacy of our subscribers very seriously. If you are ever in question about the legitimacy of an email from IBD, please contact customer service at: (800) 831-2525. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at: [www.consumer.gov/idtheft/](http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/). If you have any additional questions about the security at our Web site, you can send an email to [askibd1@investors.com](mailto:askibd1@investors.com).

Correction/Updating Personal Information  
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire to use our service, we provide a way to correct, update or remove your personal data provided to us. This can be done by accessing you're my Profile on our Web site.

Personal Information You Disclose  
Please remember that if you choose to disclose personally identifiable information on our site, such as in IBD Forums, it becomes public information and you should exercise caution. This means that your information may be viewed and/or collected and used by third parties without our or your knowledge. Such actions are not under our control and we are not responsible for events arising from your voluntary posting of personal identifiable information board.

Children  
IBD and its affiliates do not knowingly collect or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from or about children under 13. If such a situation is discovered, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe IBD has any information about or from a child under 13, please contact us at [askibd1@investors.com](mailto:askibd1@investors.com).
