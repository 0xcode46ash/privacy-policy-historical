Cookies are messages placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website or page. For example, the messages store information so that our Services may immediately recognize you each time you visit. This permits us to personalize our site for each user, allow access to the secure parts of our Services that individual users have registered for and provide users with up-to-date information about their own account.  We may also use cookies to deliver ads, store visitor preferences, record session information, such as items that visitors add to their shopping cart, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at the Site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our Site, customize web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.  Additionally, cookies are used to serve ads to logged-in users based on the voluntary information they provide in their Investing Profile.  To remove or update information from your Investing Profile, please do so here (http://myibd.investors.com).  If you choose to disable cookies, you may find that certain sections and functionalities of our Services will not work properly or at all. Web beacons, also called web bugs and clear GIFs are used in combination with cookies to help us understand the behavior of our customers. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic image that is placed on our site or in an email. The use of a web beacon allows IBD to record the simple actions of the user opening the page that contains the beacon. When a user's browser requests information from a website in this way, certain simple information can also be gathered, such as: the IP address of your computer; time the material was viewed; the type of browser that retrieved the image; and the existence of cookies previously set by that server and they provide a convenient way of gathering statistics and managing cookies.  We and other third parties may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.  If you want to adjust your settings for or delete all local storage mechanisms, go to browser's settings to do.  If information is stored in local storage in addition to a cookie, you will need to remove both the local storage and the cookie in order to fully delete the information.  We may use also use local shared objects, sometimes known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences or display content based upon what you view on our Site to personalize your visit.

**Security**

**Protection of YOUR INFORMATION**

The security of our users' information is very important to us. When users submit personal information via the Services, that information is protected by generally accepted industry standards both online and off-line.

Investor's Business Daily uses a combination of administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard Personal Information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting IBD Customer Success in accordance with the instructions below.  However, please remember that no method of electronic storage or transmission over the internet is one-hundred percent secure and therefore, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information.

**PHISHING**

Phishing is a term used to describe a type of Internet scam in which inauthentic emails that appear to be coming from a legitimate source are sent in an attempt to trick you into providing confidential information. These emails usually invoke a sense of urgency and often imply that your account is about to be closed unless immediate action is taken. They will often ask you to click on a link that leads you to a webpage that simulates that of the legitimate source, but is really a page specially designed to get you to input your confidential information such as account number, password, social security number or credit card number. The thieves then use that information to commit fraud and identity theft against you.

The Office of the Comptroller of Currency has set up a website providing information warning consumers about the dangers of these scams and how to protect yourself. To learn more about phishing, please click on the following link: [www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm](http://www.occ.gov/consumer/phishing.htm)

Please know that Investor's Business Daily takes the privacy of our subscribers very seriously. If you are ever in question about the legitimacy of an email from IBD, please contact Customer Success at: (800) 831-2525 or outside the United States 1-310-448-6600. If you believe you have been the victim of a scam, you can file a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission at: [www.consumer.gov/idtheft/](http://www.consumer.gov/idtheft/). If you have any additional questions about the security of our Services, you can contact us at askinvestorshelp.zendesk.com.

If you are visiting our Services from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. In certain circumstances law enforcement or regulatory agencies, courts or security authorities in the United States may be entitled to access your personal information.  The data protection and other laws of the United States and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country.
