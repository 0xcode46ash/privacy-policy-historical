At Invaluable, we believe strongly in protecting consumer privacy. This statement describes the privacy practices for Invaluable, including its Web site, and explains: 

  * What personally identifiable information about you (or someone else) may be collected from you
  * Our details
  * How the information is used 
  * With whom the information may be shared 
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information
  * The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the site's control
  * How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information



If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact Invaluable's customer service department at [customer.services@invaluable.com](mailto:customer.services@invaluable.com). 

#### 1\. What information do we gather and track, and what do we do with it? 

##### Information gathered from your use of our site: 

At Invaluable, we strive to provide you with a compelling reason to visit our site again. Therefore, in order to help us provide an optimal site and service, we may gather the following information in aggregate form: browser type (e.g. Navigator, Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g. Macintosh, Windows), IP address, and Internet domain (e.g. Demon, AOL). 

We use session cookies to store user name and password information that recognise if you have logged on before and enable us to improve the service we provide to you. We may also use cookies to enable our system to recognise your computer and allow us to see how you use our site. Remember that most browsers allow you to stop receiving cookies if you want - you can usually do this by disabling the relevant function on your own computer. 

##### Information gathered on subscription:

Our subscription form requires you to give us contact and billing information (your name, email address and credit card number) in order to purchase a subscription. You can choose not to provide certain additional information. 

We use the information you provide on the subscription form for accounting purposes and to contact you when necessary (for example, to respond to your queries or for other customer service issues). 

Demographic and profile data provided by you may be used to tailor your experience at our site, by showing you content that we think might be of interest to you, and by displaying content according to any explicit or implicit preferences. 

Invaluable may use your subscription information to send you information about our company and our services. You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Invaluable at any time; see the delete/deactivate section below.

##### Information gathered on registration:

Registration is free. You are required to provide a username, password and email address for the purposes of registration. Invaluable may use your registration information for the same purposes as your subscription information (above). You may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Invaluable at any time; see the delete/deactivate section below.

##### Information gathered from surveys:

Our occasional surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like their postal code, age, or income level). This demographic and profile data is used to provide aggregate customer profiles to our marketing partners and to help us create a better service. You may opt-out of receiving future survey mailings from Invaluable at any time; see the delete/deactivate section below. 

##### Information gathered from contests:

We occasionally run contests on our site and we may use any information you provide to us to contact you when necessary (with a winner's notification, for example). Each person who provides personal data to us in order to enter into one of our contests will be added to our database (including our mailing list for future contests) and that person's data shall be used and protected in accordance with this policy. Contest entrants may opt-out at any time of receiving future mailings; see the delete/deactivate section below. 

##### Other information you give us:

Emails sent to Invaluable may be used for testimonial purposes on our site without quoting the email source, but will be withdrawn if requested; see the delete/deactivate section below. 

If you register to receive newsletters or other information from us by email, Invaluable will use the email address you provide to send those letters or such information to you. You may opt-out of receiving future newsletters from Invaluable at any time; see the delete/deactivate section below. 

#### 2\. Sharing of the information 

We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away personal information about our customers other than as described in this policy.

##### Companies in the Invaluable group

We may share data supplied by you (or collected about you) with our subsidiaries and other companies in our group for the same purposes described in this policy. 

##### Changes in Invaluable's business

If all of the assets which Invaluable uses to operate its business (or substantially all of them) are acquired by a third party, we may transfer personal data we then hold to that party. 

In the unlikely event that an insolvency practitioner (such as a liquidator) is appointed in respect of Invaluable's business, that practitioner may sell, trade or rent personal data we then hold.

##### Third Parties

If you have given us permission to do so at the time of registration/ subscription, we may, from time to time, provide your details to our marketing or commercial partners, to enable us to improve the Web site or the services we provide to you or to unrelated companies in whose products or services you may be interested so that they may contact you regarding their products or services or assess your needs for such products or services or use the data you provide to send you information. We do not transfer credit card details for these purposes.

##### Overseas transfers

Due to the nature of Invaluable's business and to enable us to offer you goods and services from around the world, your data may be transferred to any country in the world for the purposes described in this policy.

#### 3\. Security 

Invaluable is committed to the security of customer information and we have security procedures in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under Invaluable's control. We use a secure server for the transfer of credit card information. If you do not have a secure browser or do not wish to send your credit card details over the web using a secure browser, you are welcome to open an account by fax or phone. 

Additionally, we have security measures in place to protect our customer database and access to this database is restricted internally. However, it remains important for you to protect against unauthorised access to your account by keeping your username and password secret and exiting from the Invaluable site when you are not using it. 

#### 4\. Opt-out policy 

Invaluable provides you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us, our group companies and our partners at the time when we request information from you, such as on our registration page or contest entry page.
