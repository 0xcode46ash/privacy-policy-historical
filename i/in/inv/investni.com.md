Invest NI offers the Northern Ireland business community a single organisation providing high-quality services, programmes, support and expert advice. Full details of these services are found within this website.

We need to hold the details of the people who have requested access to our programmes and services in order to provide them with the necessary advice or support. The nature of the data that we keep on record may include your name, company name, email address, mailing address, telephone number and employment details. Please do not provide us with information if you do not want it stored.

** Invest NI carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorised access, disclosure or alteration. Internally, data is stored in password-controlled servers with restricted access.   
Information will be destroyed in line with our [Records Management Policy](http://www.investni.com/rm_policy_version_1.5.pdf)

**Disclosure of personal information  
** To deliver a service we may need to share your information with our sponsor the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment (DETI), other agencies involved in economic development, our External Delivery Organisations and the European Commission. This will depend upon the service you require. However we will never pass on these details other than for the purpose for which they were provided to Invest NI. This may also involve the transfer of details outside the European Economic Area to our overseas offices, for those who require the services of these offices. 

Occasionally we may share information with other public bodies that provide economic development activities and whose services we feel would benefit those Clients who operate in the relevant area that the agency is providing a service.

When information is passed to an overseas Invest NI office or any other agency or External Delivery Organisation we will take appropriate steps to ensure that personal data is protected from unauthorised use and kept in a secure manner.

As required by law we may disclose information to government bodies and law enforcement agencies for their enforcement purposes.

Invest NI will not sell your personal information to any other company.

When you provide personal information to us, you understand and agree that:

  * This may involve the information being used by Invest NI and DETI for direct marketing and other economic development related activities.
  * Invest NI, DETI or another public agency providing economic development activities may also contact you directly in the future in relation to offering related services on which you provided your details to Invest NI.
  * It may involve the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area to our overseas offices.
  * Invest NI may send you marketing information about Invest NI by email.



**Opt-Out to Disclosure of personal information  
** If you do not want your details to be used in any of the ways described above, please advise Invest NI by getting in touch with your Invest NI contact – such as your Client Executive or event organiser. 

Please note that it may not be possible to provide some Invest NI services if you do not allow us to disclose information provided to us. For example, you would not be able to participate in a Trade Mission outside the European Economic Area if you were to advise that we could not transfer personal information outside this area. In addition, a number of our programmes/events will involve participation of External Delivery Organisations. If we could not share personal information with these organisations then your participation in the relevant programme/event would not be possible. This does not apply to the issue of direct marketing and you can opt out at any time with no impact upon the delivery of services.
