# Privacy Policy

Last updated on October 7, 2015.

At Invoice2go, Inc. (“ **Invoice2go** ”, “ **we** ” or “ **us** ”), we respect the privacy rights of our online visitors and users of the Invoice2go Service (“ **users** ” or “ **you** ”) and recognize the importance of protecting the information we collect about you. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share and protect your personal information. It applies both to (1) our website at Invoice2go.com, including any mobile or localized versions and any subdomains (the “ **Site** ”), and (2) our “ **Product** ”, which is our suite of services and features relating to business management, as more fully described in our [Terms of Service](http://invoice.2go.com/tosInline.aspx) (together with the Site, the “ **Service** ”). It also covers the treatment of information we may collect from social networks and certain other third party sources as described below. 

If you receive an invoice from one of our customers and then come to the Site or otherwise interact with the Service, then you are also considered a user of the Service subject to this Privacy Policy. 

Please remember that we provide the Service to small businesses who have their own privacy practices. This Privacy Policy applies only to our own data practices, and not to the practices of third parties that we do not control. 

* **_TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT_**

The categories of information we may collect include: 

  * **Registration and profile information collected when you sign up for the Service.** We may collect personally identifiable information, such as a username, first and last name, phone number or e-mail address, as well as information about your business, when you register for the Service or if you correspond with us. We may also collect information about your interactions with us, including any contact we have with you by telephone, email or online. For service improvement, security, dispute resolution and training purposes we may monitor and record your communications with us (including email and telephone).
  * **Billing information collected when you sign up for a paid account.** We may collect billing information if you sign up for a paid account as described in Section 7 (How We Store and Protect Your Information).
  * **Information collected through Invoice2go Payments.** If you use Invoice2go Payments to receive payments from End Customers (see Section 7 of our [Terms of Service](http://invoice.2go.com/tosInline.aspx)), we may collect certain information regarding your transactions from you or from our Payments Partner. If you are an End Customer paying an invoice through Invoice2go Payments as described in our [Payment Terms](https://web.archive.org/paymentTerms.aspx), we and our Payments Partner receive certain information as described in  Section 7 (How We Store and Protect Your Information).
  * **Personal and business information collected through your use of the Service.** After you set up an account for the Service, we may collect various information about your business and your customers, for example, your accounts receivable information or your customers’ mailing addresses or taxpayer identification numbers, in order to provide the Service to you. We use and share information about your customers in the same way we use and share your other information, as described below in Section 3 (How We Use the Information We Collect) and Section 4 (How We Share Your Information).
  * **Usage, viewing and technical information collected when you use the Service.** Any time you use the Service (even if you do not register for our Service), we may collect information about how you access or use the Service or input data. For more information about how we collect and use this information, see Section 2 (Our Use of Cookies and Other Technologies) below. 
  * **Information we collect from social networks and other sources.** We may receive information about you when you interact with the Service through various social media, for example, by logging in through or “liking” us on Facebook or “following” us on Twitter. The data we receive is dependent upon your privacy settings with the social network. You should always review, and, if necessary, adjust your privacy settings on third-party websites and services before linking or connecting them to the Service. In addition, we may receive information about you from other sources, such as referrals from other websites or affiliates, marketing partners or analytics providers, which we also use and share in accordance with this Privacy Policy.


  

* **_OUR USE OF COOKIES AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES_**

We automatically collect certain types of usage information when you access or use the Service. This section provides information about some of the technologies used by the Service and how they work.

**_Cookies_**. When you visit the Site, we may send one or more “cookies” — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets us help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the Site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, and other actions you take on the Service), and allows us to track your usage of the Service over time. Please refer to Section 6 (Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising) for information about how to control the use of cookies.

**_Log File_**. We may also collect log file information about your browser or mobile device each time you access the Site or use the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. If you elect to provide your contact or other personal information to us during your browsing session, we may link that information to the IP address from which you are accessing the site.

**_Clear Gifs_**. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons) which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users and invoice recipients to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients of those emails. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. These tools collect information sent by your browser or mobile device, including the pages you visit, your use of third party applications, and other information that assists us in analyzing and improving the Service. Although we do our best to honor the privacy preferences of our users, we are not able to respond to Do Not Track signals from your browser at this time, as we believe that there is no consistent industry standard for how to respond to Do Not Track browser settings.

**_Device IDs_**. When you access the Site or use the Service by or through a mobile device, we may receive or collect and store a unique identification number associated with your device (“ **Device ID** ”), mobile carrier, device type and manufacturer, phone number, and, depending on your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates (e.g. latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Similar to IP addresses, we may link any of the contact or other personal information you provide during a browsing session to the Device ID from which you are accessing the Site.

* **_HOW WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT_**

We use your information in the following ways: 

  * To provide, maintain and improve the Service and our other products and services, including to operate certain features and functionality of the Service (for example, by remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during this or subsequent visits);
  * To process your order or inquiries;
  * To diagnose or fix technology problems;
  * To control unauthorized use or abuse of the Service and our other products and services, or otherwise detect, investigate or prevent activities that may violate our policies or be illegal;
  * To analyze trends, administer or optimize the Service, monitor usage or traffic patterns (including to track users’ movements or actions with the Service) and gather demographic information about our user base as a whole; 
  * To deliver customer service;
  * To communicate directly with you, including sending you newsletters, promotions and special offers or information about new products and services on an ongoing basis. Your opt-out options for promotional communications are described below under Section 5 (Your Choices about Your Information); 
  * To deliver you advertising, including to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads on the Service or on third party sites, and to tailor ads based on your interests and browsing history (please see Section 5 (Your Choices about Your Information) and Section 6 (Third Party Tracking and Online Advertising) for additional information related to such advertising and your related controls); and
  * In the manner described to you at the time of collection or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.



Any use of your information that is incompatible with the foregoing will be disclosed to you in advance so that you may opt out of such use at your discretion.

* **_HOW WE SHARE YOUR INFORMATION_**

We may share your personally identifiable information with: 

  * Our parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. These companies will use the information in the same way as we can under this Privacy Policy;
  * Third-party vendors and other service providers that perform services on our behalf, as needed to carry out their work for us, which may include identifying and serving targeted advertisements, content or service fulfillment, or providing analytic, archival, auditing, accounting, legal, business consulting, banking, payment, delivery, data processing, data analysis, research, investigation, website or other technology services; 
  * Our payment processors, for the purposes described in Section 7 (How We Store and Protect Your Information);
  * Our business partners who offer a service to you jointly with us, for example, when running a co-sponsored contest or promotion; 
  * Other users of the Service who have sent you an invoice or with whom you’ve otherwise interacted through the features of the Service. For example, as a customer of one of our users, we may share certain information about you with that user, such as whether you have opened an emailed invoice or made a payment;
  * Other parties in connection with a company transaction, such as a merger, sale of company assets or shares, reorganization, financing, change of control or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company or third party or in the event of a bankruptcy or related or similar proceedings; and 
  * Third parties if we have a good faith belief that disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to: (i) satisfy any law, legal process or governmental request; (ii) enforce our [Terms of Service](http://invoice.2go.com/tosInline.aspx), including investigation of potential violations thereof; or (iii) protect against fraud, imminent harm to the Service or the rights, property or safety of Invoice2go, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.



Some of the third parties described above may be located in other countries. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you accept you may not be able to seek redress under local privacy or data protection laws for their conduct. Please refer to Storage and Processing in Section 7 (How We Store and Protect Your Information) for more information.

We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with third parties for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually, but may include usage, viewing and technical information we collected through our technology. If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as personally identifiable information, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise we may disclose such information for any reason. Please note that Invoice2go is not responsible should an invoice recipient choose to share an invoice containing your information with third parties.

* **_YOUR CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION_**

**You control your account information and communication preferences:** You may update certain of your account information and communication preferences at any time by logging into your account and changing your account settings. You can also stop receiving promotional email communications from us by clicking on the “unsubscribe link” provided in such communications. We make every effort to promptly process all unsubscribe requests. You may not, however, opt out of Service-related communications (e.g., account verification, purchase and billing confirmations and reminders, changes/updates to features of the Service, technical and security notices) unless you terminate your account. If you have any questions about reviewing or modifying your account information, you can contact us directly at the address provided in Section 10 (How to Contact Us).

**How long we keep your personally identifiable information:** Following termination or deactivation of your account, Invoice2go may retain your personally identifiable information for backup, archival or audit purposes. Please contact us at the address provided in Section 10 (How to Contact Us) if you wish to close your account or delete this information. Upon request, Invoice2go will make good faith efforts to delete your personally identifiable information if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes and unless such requests would require disproportionate technical effort. We will respond to all such requests within thirty (30) days. If you are in Australia, unless we are otherwise required by law to retain your personally identifiable information, we will take reasonable steps to destroy or de-identify it where we no longer need it for any permitted purpose under the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).

* **_THIRD PARTY TRACKING AND ONLINE ADVERTISING_**

We may permit third party ad networks, social media companies, and other third party services to collect information about your browsing behavior on the Service through cookies, social plug-ins, or other tracking technology. We may permit third party online advertising networks to collect information about your use of the Service over time so that they may play or display ads that may be relevant to your interests on the Service as well as on other websites or services. Typically, the information is collected through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools.

Any credit card information you provide is stored by our third party payment processors (including our Payments Partner, if you use Invoice2go Payments), who have committed to complying with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS).

**Keeping your information safe:** Invoice2go cares about the security of your information, and uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technological safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of all information collected through the Service. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee the security of our systems 100%. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, Invoice2go will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.
