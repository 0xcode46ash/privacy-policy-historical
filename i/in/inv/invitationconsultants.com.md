As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamp.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information, except to prevent fraud or abuse of our systems. 

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We use persistent cookies set by one of our service providers only to measure and track the effectiveness of certain marketing campaigns.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as your shopping cart, will be limited.

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Invitation Consultants, Inc. Please be aware that we, Invitation Consultants, Inc., are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this Web site.

The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). 

Authentic Sites, like [www.invitationconsultants.com](http://www.invitationconsultants.com/), use Thawte SSL Web Server Certificates to offer secure communications by encrypting all data to and from the site. Thawte has checked and verified the company's registration documents and the site's registered domain name. When entering a quote, you will see a little padlock on the bottom of your browser. By double-clicking on the padlock, you will see the Certificate issued by Thawte to Invitation Consultants, Inc.  

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can send an email to us at customerservice@invitationconsultants.com.

In the event Invitation Consultants, Inc. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred.  You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
