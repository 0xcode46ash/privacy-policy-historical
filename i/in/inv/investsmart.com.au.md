**InvestSMART is committed to safeguarding your privacy online.**

InvestSMART Global Pty Ltd has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website : www.InvestSMART.com.au 

www.InvestSMART.com.au does not collect personally identifiable information about individuals except when such individuals specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. For example, such personally identifiable information may be gathered from the registration process for subscription or services and in connection with content submissions, community postings (e.g. forums), suggestions and transactional areas. 

Personally identifiable information on individual users will not be sold or otherwise transferred to unaffiliated third parties without the approval of the user at the time of collection. At such points of collection, the user will have the opportunity to indicate whether he or she would like to "opt out" of receiving promotional and/or marketing information about other products, services and offerings from www.InvestSMART.com.au and/or any third parties. 

Further, notwithstanding any opt out of promotional information by the user, www.InvestSMART.com.au reserves the right to contact a subscriber regarding account status, changes to the subscriber agreement and other matters relevant to the underlying service and/or the information collected. 

www.InvestSMART.com.au reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. www.InvestSMART.com.au will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. 

Users should be aware that www.InvestSMART.com.au may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through a www.InvestSMART.com.au site. www.InvestSMART.com.au is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and users should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. 

Upon request, www.InvestSMART.com.au will allow any user to "opt out" of further promotional contacts at any time. Additionally upon request, www.InvestSMART.com.au will use reasonable efforts to allow users to update/correct personal information previously submitted which the user states is erroneous to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Also, upon a user's request, www.InvestSMART.com.au will use commercially reasonable efforts to functionally delete the user and his or her personal information from its database; however, it may be impossible to delete a user's entry without some residual information because of backups and records of deletions. 

Access to the database containing personal information is restricted to InvestSMART staff members with direct responsibility for customer service or management of the website. Authorised staff members are not allowed to pass on information about members to non-authorised staff without the express permission of the Managing Director.
