# Privacy Policy

Thank you for shopping with us at InvitationBox.com. We have ensured the privacy and security of your transactions with us. Your credit card information and other data given during the order process will be guarded with the highest levels of security and confidentiality. We believe the following info will address this as well as other privacy issues.

Is my credit card secure?

Your credit card transactions are secure. All on-line orders are encrypted and sent through our secure server, using SSL technology to prevent information from being intercepted.

Confidential information such as your credit card number will be used only to fulfill your order. To protect your privacy, we will ask you to enter your credit card number and expiration date each time you place an order with us. This way, even if someone else accesses the account information stored on your computer, they won't be able to use your credit card.

What about my personal information? 

When you place an order, fill out a survey or sign up for information, we ask for your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and so forth.

Your name and address information is used solely for verifying your identity and for processing your order. We do not share, rent or barter any personal information. We will not disclose any personal information unless required by law to do so.

What about E-mail? 

Information contained within general email inquiries sent to customerservice@invitationbox.com is used solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry. Your request for a product may be entered into a general database to help us track requests from customers. Your identity is not recorded in this database.

We will send you information by e-mail, if you have requested it or are a member of InvitationBox.com's E-mail Exclusives. We will always give you the opportunity to be removed from our e-mail mailing list.
