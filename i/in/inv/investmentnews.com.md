# InvestmentNews -- The Weekly Newspaper for Financial Advisers

This is the web site of InvestmentNews.

The InvestmentNews Group, publishers of InvestmentNews.com, has developed this Privacy Policy to advise site users of our possible uses of information collected during an InvestmentNews.com visit.

For each visitor to InvestmentNews.com, our web server automatically attempts to identify the user's domain name, but not the e-mail address. We collect and store the domain name of InvestmentNews.com users in our log files. We also track information, in aggregate, on pages and features that users access or view. 

Users electing to search the data and/or archives of InvestmentNews.com are required to supply personal and professional information during a "registration" process prior to using the search function. Occasionally, we may also collect information volunteered by the user, such as survey information or contest entries.

Information collected about users may be used by the InvestmentNews Group (and our partnering companies) to provide users with the features of the site, for audits, to perform statistical analysis of user behavior in order to measure interest in various areas of our site (for product development purposes) and to inform advertisers as to how many users have seen or "clicked" their advertising banners. We will disclose site usage information to third parties only in aggregate.

From time to time, we may make individual user information available to carefully selected third parties to send you information through e-mail or postal mail about their products or services. During the registration process, a user can indicate on the registration form that he or she does not wish to receive such marketing materials via e-mail or postal mail. Additionally, a user can indicate that he or she does not want to receive news about new site features or marketing materials from the InvestmentNews Group via e-mail. The InvestmentNews Group retains the right to contact a registered user regarding account status or changes to the registration agreement. 

Registrants can "opt out" of future contact by altering the settings on the "EDIT PROFILE" page of http://www.InvestmentNews.com.
