# Our Privacy Policy | Invoice Dealers Autos

[Home](https://web.archive.org/web/20090816213642id_/http%3A//www.invoicedealers.com/Default.asp)     Privacy Policy 

As Web users ourselves, we understand the importance of online privacy. And we are committed to respecting yours. 

We exist to help people find places to buy cars. In order to operate, we need to gather and supply personal information about prospective car buyers. We are committed to responsible handling of the information you provide us. This means that we will not abuse it and will use it only as outlined below. It also means that we will supply it through business relationships only to auto retailing network partners whose privacy policies are equally respectful of your rights. 

Dealix Corp. ("we") operate a system which introduces new car shoppers to new car retailers or retail networks. This system can appear to the shopping consumer ("you") in one of two ways. 

First, it can appear as the branded site "InvoiceDealers.com". This site is owned, controlled, and operated in its entirety by us. 

Second, it can appear as a new car buying service on a Web site owned, controlled, and operated by an entity other than us. In this case, the buying service may be identified as "powered by InvoiceDealers", "powered by Dealix", or neither. 

In any case, the buying service itself (hereafter referred to as "the Process" or "we"), regardless of where you find it and how it is identified, is owned, controlled, and operated by us. This Privacy Policy covers the gathering and use of information identifiable to you which is performed by the Process. The information here is equally applicable regardless of how or where you encounter the Process. 

We use your IP address, collected automatically by our Web servers, to analyze our traffic sources and to discourage fraudulent use of the Process. This information does not identify you personally. 

The Process places "cookies" on your hard drive. Cookies are small amounts of textual information which allow the Process to work better for you by storing information such as the vehicle you’re currently configuring, etc. These cookies are only used by the Process during the time you’re in the Process. We don’t collect them or use them in other ways. If you don’t like the fact that cookies are placed on your hard drive by our Process or any other Web site, you can set your browser preferences so that you don’t accept cookies, or only accept them on demand. 

We have partnered with the 3rd party ad delivery companies such that anonymous information is collected regarding your visit to our site. This information is used to deliver the targeted ads to you as you surf the Internet. It is our understanding that this form of advertising delivery is in partnership with the site publishers and is not considered to be Spyware or Adware. Again, these companies do not collect any personally identifiable information through the use of their technology. These partners offer the ability to opt-out of their information collection method as follows. 

  * DRIVEpm and Atlas DMT (www.networkadvertising.org)
  * Advertising.com (www.advertising.com/Privacy.html)



If you ask to be introduced to an auto dealer or dealer network through our Process, one of two things will happen. 

If you have been matched by the Process software to a retail channel for which we gather the personal information, we need you to voluntarily provide your name, email address, phone number, and other information to make the introduction possible. This information will be stored in our databases and may be used to email you a follow-up survey regarding your experience. It may also be used to send you information regarding changes to our services. You may opt out of receiving such notices by emailing your request to removeme@dealix.com. We will also provide it to the retailer or retail network to whom we’re introducing you. The retailer or retail network will then use the information to contact you regarding your request. Our own contracted retailers, identified as “InvoiceDealers Network Retailers”, will use the information to communicate with you regarding your automotive needs. The use of the information by other retail networks is governed by the privacy policy of the network which receives the information. This network is clearly identified to you before you choose to submit the information. We aren’t responsible for individual networks’ policies or practices. 

If you have been matched by the Process to a retail channel for which our retail network partner gathers the personal information, you will leave our Process and enter another process owned and operated by our network partner. In this case, your experience in the outside process, any information collected from you there, and the disposition of that information, will be governed by the privacy policy of the network which owns and operates the process. The identity of the network is clearly supplied to you before you choose to leave our Process and enter the process of the partner. We aren’t responsible for individual networks’ policies or practices. 

We may share generalized information about our customers or traffic sources with our business partners. This does not include any information through which you can be personally identified. 

If we are required by law through court order or subpoena to release personal information, we will comply. This has never occurred in the history of our company and we consider the possibility of this occurring in the future to be remote. 

We will never supply your personal information to any of our retail channels without first identifying the channel to you and allowing you to choose not to proceed. If you do proceed, any use of your information beyond that point is solely governed by the privacy policy of the identified partner. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of external partners. 

We reserve the right to change or amend this Privacy Policy at any time in response to changing business needs. Please check regularly for updates which may affect your use of Dealix services.
