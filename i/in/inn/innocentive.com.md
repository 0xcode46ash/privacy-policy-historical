# Privacy Policy | InnoCentive

**InnoCentive respects and protects your data privacy rights.** This statement includes both InnoCentive's European Union - U.S. Safe Harbor Privacy Statement and our Website Privacy Statement.

**U.S. - EU Safe Harbor Privacy Statement**  
For personal information of employees, Seekers and Solvers that InnoCentive receives from the European Economic Area, InnoCentive has committed to handling such personal information in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles. For more information about the Safe Harbor Principles and InnoCentive's certification, please visit the U.S. Department of Commerce's Website at:  
[http://www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/).

**InnoCentive Website Privacy Statement**  
InnoCentive respects the privacy of visitors to its website (our "Site"), as a result, we have developed this Privacy Policy.

**Information that We Collect**  
Through our Site, InnoCentive will collect information that can identify you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and other similar information ("Your Information") when it is voluntarily submitted to us when you register as a Solver or when you request information from us (however, see discussion below about "IP Addresses" if you have a broadband connection). We will use Your Information to respond to requests you may make of us, to communicate with you about InnoCentive Challenges, and from time to time, we may refer to Your Information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our websites, products and services.

**Web Beacons and Cookies**  
Our Site may use a technology known as **web beacons** \- sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that allow this Site to collect **web log** information. A web beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an e-mail message designed to track pages viewed or messages opened. Web log information is gathered when you visit the Site by the computer that hosts our Site (called a "webserver"). The webserver automatically recognizes some non-personal information, such as the date and time you visited our Site, the pages you visited, the website you came from, the type of browser you are using (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows XP/Vista, Leopard, etc.), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider. We may also include web beacons in promotional e-mail messages in order to determine whether messages have been opened.

Our Site may also use a technology called a " **cookie** ". A cookie is a piece of information that our webserver sends to your computer (actually to a folder on your computer that√≠s managed by your web browser) when you access a website. Then when you come back, our Site will detect whether you have one of our cookies on your computer. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that keeps you from needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. Additionally, you can disable cookies by changing the settings in your browser. However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the features of our Site, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you do leave cookies turned on, be sure to sign off when you finish using a shared computer.

Our Site uses Internet Protocol (IP) Addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet. Generally, an IP address changes each time you connect to the Internet (it is a "dynamic" address). Note, however, that if you have a broadband connection, depending on your individual circumstance, it is possible that your IP Address that we collect, or even perhaps a cookie we use, may contain information that could be deemed personally identifiable. This is because with some broadband connections your IP Address doesn't change (it is "static") and could be associated with your personal computer. We use your IP address to report aggregate information on use and to help improve the Site.

**Use by Minors**  
You should be aware that this site is not intended for use by, or designed to attract, individuals under the age of 18. You may not register as a Solver if you are under the age of 18, or have not reached the age of majority in your jurisdiction. We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we actually know is an individual under the age of 13.

**Sharing of Your Information**  
We may share Your Information with agents, contractors or partners of InnoCentive in connection with services that these individuals or entities perform for, or with, InnoCentive. These agents, contractors or partners are restricted from using this data in any way other than to provide services for InnoCentive, or services for the collaboration in which they and InnoCentive are engaged (for example, our Seekers). By submitting a Proposed Solution to an InnoCentive Challenge, for example, you acknowledge that we may share Your Information with Seekers as part of the Challenge evaluation process, and you consent that we may share Your Information with Seekers for this purpose, and to make Awards in the event that your Proposed Solution is accepted by a Seeker.

If you are referred to a Challenge via another user's referral link, certain activity (e.g, registering, opening a project room for that Challenge, submitting a solution for that Challenge, or receiving an award for that Challenge) may be viewable in an anonymized and aggregated fashion by the referring user. No username, Solver ID, profile information, or other identifiable information will be made available.

InnoCentive reserves the right to share Your Information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law. In exceptionally rare circumstances where national, state or company security may be at issue, InnoCentive reserves the right to share our entire database of visitors and Solvers with appropriate governmental authorities.

We may also provide Your Information to a third party in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this website to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat Your Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Areas of this Site that collect Your Information use industry standard secure socket layer encryption (SSL); however, to take advantage of this your browser must support encryption protection.

**Links to Third Party Websites**  
As a convenience to our visitors, our Site may contain links to sites that we believe may offer useful information to you or the web sites of our Seekers. The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to any third party sites. We suggest contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy, security, data collection, and distribution policies.

**Notices and Revisions**  
Our business changes constantly and our Privacy Notice may change also. We may e-mail periodic reminders of our notices and conditions, unless you have instructed us not to, but you should check our Site frequently to see recent changes. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Notice applies to all information that we have about you and your account. We will not make material changes to our policies and practices to make them less protective of Your Information collected in the past under prior policies without the consent of affected registered Solvers.
