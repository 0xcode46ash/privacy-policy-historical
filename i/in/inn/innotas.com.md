# Innotas

Innotas has created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to customer privacy. Privacy on our web site is of great importance to us. Because we gather information from our visitors and customers, we have established this statement as a means to communicate our information gathering and dissemination practices.

This Privacy Policy covers Innotas' treatment of personally identifiable information that we may collect when you are on our site. This policy also applies to Innotas' treatment of any personally identifiable information that our business partners share with us. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people whom we do not employ or manage.

We may collect personally identifiable information when you visit or use our site. We may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. We also automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information and the page you requested.

We may use this information for three general purposes: to customize the content you see, to fulfill your requests for certain services and information, and to contact you.

We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 

  1. We have your consent to share the information; 
  2. We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested; 
  3. We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Innotas to provide a product or service to you (unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us); 
  4. We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process; 
  5. Or, we find that your actions on our web site violate the Innotas Subscription Agreement, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
