Privacy practices on the web

Your privacy is important to Inmarsat. This privacy statement discloses the personal information practices for the Inmarsat Limited website.

In general, you can visit our website home page and browse our site without telling us who you are and without revealing any information about yourself. You may choose to give us personal information, such as your name and address, to enable us to correspond with you.

We may collect any personal information that you volunteer while using our services for standard purposes including administration, marketing, customer services and the provision of offers of related services.

We will only use your personal information in a way that is fair (with reference to the purposes which are either disclosed to you or are relevant to the reason for your giving us the information). We may share your information with our subsidiary companies, organisations who are our business partners or with other organisations where necessary to provide the services or products which you requested when providing us with your information. This may mean that your information is transferred to countries outside the European Economic Area.

When we collect personal data from you in connection with an enquiry, we may extract some information about that query in an anonymous format and combine it with other anonymous information for marketing and advertising purposes. This anonymous information is used and analysed only at an aggregate level to help us to understand trends and patterns. None of this information is reviewed at an individual level.

Inmarsat Limited is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal data.
