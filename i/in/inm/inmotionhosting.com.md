## Customer Testimonials

Before I found InMotion Hosting I was paying my ISP 3 times as much money for less disk space and bandwidth. With InMotion, I not only get more for my hard earned dollars, I actually am able to talk to a live support technician on the phone, instead of being on hold for what seems like an eternity. I also opted for the pro plan and I'm able to host all of my websites on one account."
