**User Information**  
All users who view our pages retain complete anonymity where Inmatrix is concerned. As information is delivered, Inmatrix does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. Inmatrix does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. Inmatrix servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of site statisticss and measuring the site's effectiveness. 

**The Cookie Principle**  
Inmatrix may use cookies to improve your web browsing experience. When you are first served an Inmatrix page, Inmatrix may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to save you the trouble of entering the same data repeatedly (your user name in the forum as an example). Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 

**Disclosure**  
Inmatrix openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to our [eMail](http://inmatrix.com/email.shtml). 

Inmatrix reserves the right to change our policy from time to time. A revised policy will apply to information collected after the date the policy is changed.
