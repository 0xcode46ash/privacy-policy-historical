# Create and Send Email Newsletters and Optimize INbox Deliverability with INinbox

### Where we stand on gathering, sharing and protecting your info

### When you sign up for a free account, we will ask you for information. This information _may include_ :

  * Your name
  * Your company name
  * Your company or home address
  * Your telephone number
  * Your email address
  * Your email list details
  * How many emails you plan to send
  * Whether you use good email marketing practices



### Likewise, when you sign up for a paid plan, we will ask you for the same information as above, as well as:

  * The name on your credit card
  * Your credit card number
  * Your credit card number expiration date
  * The three or four-digit safety code on the back of your card

### What we do with that info

As far as your info goes, excluding your credit card data, here's where we stand:

  * We keep your info strictly for ourselves. 
  * We will not exploit that info.
  * We may use your data for marketing purposes, if only to find out who our customer base is as a whole, or which products you may need in the future, but that's it. We use the strictest standards and protocols to protect your data.
  * When you use your credit card to sign up, we absolutely, 100% protect your data and keep it internal. We use an outside credit card processing company, but they are not permitted to store, retain or use your info except to process your transaction.



### Your IP address, cookies and other info

When you visit INinbox, we are able to view your IP address. However, **your IP address does not identify you as a user, but merely the general area of where you live.**

While we may review your list when you upload it, just to make sure it's opt-in, we do not monitor or review the content beyond that first stage.  
Also, when you create or upload an email list and store it with our service, **we do not sell, rent or give away the data on your list.** That data is yours and yours alone, we merely store it for you when you use our service.

### What Type of Data Do We Collect?

Generally, we collect or maintain the following categories of data: 

  * **Customer Registration Data** : when a customer, whether an individual or an entity, activates our services, creates an account at the Site or registers at an event we collect account information from that customer. The Customer Registration Data we collect includes individual or contact name, company name, e-mail address, phone number and other contact information, as well as information about services requested and payment information, such as credit card number, expiration date and billing address. We also assign customers a unique username and password to access their account information through the Site;
  * **Customer Message Recipient Data** : we also maintain data that has been provided to us or uploaded to the Site by our customers.  Typically, Customer Message Recipient Data relates to individuals or entities who have opted in to receive email messages or other types of communications from our customers, and may include name, e-mail address, contact information, and other information. Under our Anti-Spam Policy, customers must obtain a recipient's consent prior to sending the recipient an e-mail through our service. For more information, please see the section below entitled "Why Do You Receive E-mails"; and
  * **Site Data** : we use cookies, web beacons, and other automated devices to automatically collect information about visitors to our Site and users of our services, which we refer to in this Policy as "Site Data." The Site Data we collect includes browser type, operating system and IP address, as well as information of the web pages viewed and links clicked by visitors and/or customers. We may combine Site Data with other data we have collected from users, such as Customer Registration Data.



Although the majority of our customers are businesses, some of the Customer Registration Data submitted or maintained by us may identify or relate to an individual ("personal data"), rather than a business.  


### Why Do You Receive Emails?

If you received one or more marketing or promotional e-mails ("commercial e-mails") from us, it means that a) your email address is on our list of customers, trial users or prospective customers; or b) you have provided us your email address so that we could contact you. If you believe you received an email from us in error, please contact us immediately at _abuse@ininbox.com_

Our customers may also use INinbox's service to send commercial e-mails to users who have opted-in to receive such e-mails. According to Ininbox’s Anti-Spam Policy, our customers are not permitted to send unsolicited marketing or promotional e-mails, and are required to obtain opt-in consent from a recipient, prior to sending a commercial e-mail to the recipient's e-mail address. 

While we have a strict Anti-Spam Policy, we can not guarantee that our customers will always honor such policy. If you believe you have received an e-mail from one of our customers in error or in violation of our Anti-Spam Policy, please contact us immediately at _abuse@ininbox.com_

If you do not wish to receive additional commercial emails from INinbox, simply click the unsubscribe link and follow the instructions to unsubscribe your e-mail address or to change your preferences about the types of e-mail we send you.
