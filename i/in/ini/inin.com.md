# Privacy Policy | Interactive Intelligence

_Date last revised: 9/1/2016_

**Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc. Privacy Notice**

Interactive Intelligence Group, Inc. (“Interactive Intelligence”) has developed a comprehensive privacy program designed to respect and protect your data privacy rights. This Privacy Notice explains what personally identifiable information we collect through our Internet websites located at [http://inin.com](http://inin.com/) and [http://debtsoftware.com ](http://www.debtsoftware.com/ "Latitude Software")and all subdomains thereof (the “Sites”) and how we use that information.

**Personally Identifiable Information We Collect and How We Use It**

In general, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. In fact, we encourage anonymous surfing so that you can find out more about who we are and how our products can help streamline business communications and other processes. However, there are times when we may need and request personally identifiable information from you so that we can better serve you.

Interactive Intelligence will only collect personally identifiable information (such as your name, mailing address, telephone number, or email address, employer name, employer address or products and operating systems you use) when it is voluntarily submitted to us at the Sites. We will use this information to comply with your request for information or as otherwise disclosed to you at the location on the Sites at which you submit your information. For example, if you request technical support assistance, we need to know who you are, what product you are using and in what computer system environment you are using the product in order to respond to your request as efficiently and effectively as possible. If you are interested in signing up for one of our Webinars, the personally identifiable information you provide to us will enable us to tailor the Webinar more closely to your specific needs. Also, when you request a product download from the Sites, we want to be able to follow up with you to address any questions you might have about using our products. In addition, from time to time, we may refer to your personally identifiable information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our products and services. We may use that information to contact you.

We provide links to third party Internet sites strictly as a service to you. Your personally identifiable information is not shared with these third parties. However, Interactive Intelligence is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party Internet sites. If you leave the Sites you should be sure to read the privacy notice of each Internet site that you visit.

The Sites use information in aggregate form to track the total number of visitors to our, the number of visitors to each page of our Sites, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. No personally identifiable information is revealed to us in this process.

The Sites are not intended or designed to attract children under the age of 13. Interactive Intelligence does not collect personally identifiable data from any person it knows to be under the age of 13.

Some pages within the Sites may use a technology called "cookies". A cookie is a token that a server gives to your browser when you access an Internet website. Cookies are capable of storing many types of data. Cookies help provide additional functionality to the Sites or to help us analyze site usage more accurately. In all cases in which cookies are used, the cookie will not collect personally identifiable information except with your explicit permission. However, information gathered from use of cookies may be combined with other data sources to identify you.

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information to Third Parties**

We will not sell or otherwise transfer the personally identifiable information you provide via the Sites to any third party unless (1) otherwise disclosed to you when you submit your information; (2) in connection with the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of a business division of Interactive Intelligence, a line of Interactive Intelligence’s business or Interactive Intelligence’s entire business or merger with another company; (3) to provide needed information to our agents, resellers, partners and contractors who may provide products and/or services to you; (4) as necessary for processing your credit card transactions or support transactions; or (5) for compliance with possible legal or governmental disclosure requirements. We do not rent, sell or otherwise share information that we gather about our website visitors with outside parties. The bottom line is that all the personally identifiable information that you provide to us via the Sites will remain with Interactive Intelligence and/or its agents, resellers, contractors and alliance partners.

**Protecting Personally Identifiable Information**  
 

Interactive Intelligence is committed to protecting the personally identifiable information entrusted to us. We have implemented reasonable and appropriate physical, electronic and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure this information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration and destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmitted over or accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Interactive Intelligence attempts to protect all personally identifiable information, we cannot ensure or warrant that personally identifiable information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. We will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your personally identifiable information (as defined by the applicable state and federal laws) stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.

**Your California Privacy Rights   **

California law provides that California residents have a right to request businesses to tell them how their personal information has been shared with third parties, if at all, for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please contact our Data Protection Officer at [DPO@inin.com](mailto:DPO@inin.com).

**Do Not Track Signals   **

Certain web browsers and other devices you may use to access the website may permit you to indicate your preference that you do not wish to be “tracked” online.  At this time, the website does not respond to "Do Not Track" signals.

**Changes to this Privacy Notice**

  
It is our policy to post any changes we make to our Privacy Notice on the Sites. If we make material changes to how we treat the personally identifiable information that falls within the scope of our Privacy Notice, we will notify you by email to the email address specified in your account or through a notice on the Site home page.
