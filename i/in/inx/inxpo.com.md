INXPO Privacy Policy
LAST UPDATED: November 27, 2017
INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or “us”) is committed to protecting and respecting your
privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”), together with our Terms of Use and any other document
referred to therein, describes how INXPO treats personal data when you, the user, access the
INXPO platform, mobile application or website located at www.inxpo.com (the “Website”), or if
you otherwise communicate with us, for example by requesting information related to our
services. In this Policy, the term “Personal Data” means information that relates to an identified
or identifiable natural person.
This Policy only applies to Personal Data collected by INXPO, and does not apply to any
Personal Data collected by any third party. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with
privacy policies applicable to any websites and services operated by third parties as we are not
responsible for the privacy practices of any third parties.
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
WEBSITE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND AND
AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU
DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE.
A. Introduction.
INXPO collects, uses, discloses, transfers, and otherwise processes data, including Personal
Data, in several ways, as described herein.
B. Type of Information INXPO Collects.
If you choose not to provide any requested Personal Data, you may be unable to access certain
areas of the Website, register for or purchase our products or services, or receive
communications from us regarding our products, services or the Website.
    1. Registration Information. Certain areas of the Website may require you to input
         Personal Data such as your name, email address and other business or contact
         information in order to register, enter a password protected area or to receive further
         information about INXPO products or services.
    2. Account-Related Activity. Most events require you to register by creating an account in
         order to attend or otherwise participate in the virtual event. To create a user account, you
         will be required to provide INXPO and the Sponsor of the virtual event with Personal
         Data such as an email address. Some virtual events may also ask you to create a user
         profile containing additional Personal Data and a password. No transaction payment data
         is collected or stored by INXPO.
    3. Your Activities. INXPO may record information about your activities on and/or usage of
         the Website automatically. Activity information may include which pages you visited,
         what URL you came from or visit after you leave the Website, average time spent on the
59271926.1


Website, previously shared information, your domain or IP address, etc. In addition, if
you are logged into a password protected area, we may associate that information with
your account. To accomplish this we may use the following:
a. Web Beacons. Web Beacons are strings of code placed on a webpage in conjunction
   with cookies. Web Beacons are able to track the number of users that visit a website
   and, in conjunction with cookies, identify the IP address and personalize the website
   experience. Web Beacons may also be used to collect anonymous and/or aggregate,
   unidentifiable information such as how many users attended a virtual event.
b. IP Address. The IP address is the numerical label associated with the location of
   your computing device.
c. Cookies. In some cases, INXPO may use HTTP cookies, Flash and Silverlight
   Cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will
   not have to reenter it during your visit or the next time you visit the event; (b) provide
   customer, personalized content and information; or (c) monitor aggregate metrics
   such as total number of visitors, pages, viewed, and similar information. A cookie is a
   small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is placed on your
   computer or on your mobile phone/tablet (collectively referred to herein as a
   “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard
   drive. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent
   cookies. Session cookies are held temporarily and disappear when you close your
   browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits.
   Cookies are widely used to provide certain features of website, to make websites
   perform more efficiently, and to provide information to the owners of the website.
   Each INXPO event and/or webcast can send its own cookie to your browser if your
   browser’s preferences allow it. For events and webcasts, cookies record information
   about your online preferences and allow us to present content to your interests. Users
   have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a
   cookie is issued or not to receive cookies at any time. If you do not opt in to receiving
   cookies and/or set your device to not receive cookies, certain personalized features
   cannot be provided to you, and accordingly you may not be able to take full
   advantage of the Website’s features.
d. Third-Party Cookies. You may be presented with cookies from third-party websites
   and providers that are not related to INXPO. For example, when you view a webpage
   with content embedded from a third-party provider, you may be presented with
   cookies from such provider. INXPO does not control the dissemination of these
   third-party cookies. In general, you should check the third-party websites for more
   information. In addition, INXPO provides an optional single sign-on using social
   networks including, but not limited to, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google and
   Microsoft LiveId. If you are logging into an INXPO event using a social network
   credential, the applicable third party, and not INXPO, will set cookies. INXPO does
   not control or have any access to the cookie information these social networks may
   set.
                                          2


      e. Local Shared Objects (Flash Cookies). INXPO uses both the Adobe Flash Player
          and Silverlight players to deliver certain video content services. To improve the user
          experience, Local Shared Objects (otherwise known as Flash or Silverlight Cookies
          or LSOs) are used to provide features such as auto-resume and for saving your
          preferences. Flash and Silverlight Cookies are stored on a user’s device much the
          same as cookies are, however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the
          same way. To disable or delete flash cookies, see
          http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security for more information. To
          disable or delete Silverlight cookies, see
          http://www.ehow.com/how_5972751_remove-silverlight-cookies.html for more
          information. Please be aware that removal or restricting the use of cookies may affect
          the features available to you for applications from the Website, within INXPO events,
          or for our products or services.
      f. Local Storage. INXPO uses browser local storage on personal computers and mobile
          devices to deliver its services.
   4. Content. Any Personal Data or content that you voluntarily upload or otherwise disclose
      while on the Website (such as, through use of an INXPO blog), including but not limited
      to information disclosed on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within a
      profile page, or images or any other content you provide (“Content”), becomes publicly
      available and can be collected and used by others. In addition, if you are given the ability
      to log into your account with any social networking website, or post Content on such site,
      other third-party website, or through the Website, such Content may be made available to
      other parties and associated with your Personal Data. Personal Data uploaded in
      association with any INXPO event or webcast is only used for and shared with the
      particular customer of INXPO for that event. Data that is in an aggregate form which is
      no longer considered Personal Data may be used for purposes of research and analysis.
C. Purposes for Which INXPO Collects Information.
   1. Operation, Maintenance and Flagging. If you submit Personal Data through the
      Website, INXPO may use it to operate, maintain, and provide you with the general and
      personalized features and functionality of the Website, provide you with the INXPO
      products and services you request or order, complete transactions, or communicate with
      you. We may also use such Personal Data to process any flagging activity or
      correspondence you send to us.
   2. Messaging. Your account registration information may be displayed in password
      protected areas to other users. If you choose to receive email from INXPO, we may use
      clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons) in HTML-based emails sent to you to track which emails
      are opened by recipients.
   3. No Commercial Marketing. INXPO will not use your email address or other Personal
      Data to send commercial or marketing messages for our benefit without your consent,
      except as part of a specific program or feature or other business relationship for which
      you opt in. We will not share your Personal Data with third-party marketers.
                                                 3

        your consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes, such as notifying you for
        customer service reasons.
    5. Quality & Features. INXPO may use Personal Data and certain non-personally
        identifiable information to improve the quality and design of the Website and to create
        new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and
        processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications, to
        improve or personalize your experience, to improve or manage the Website or products
        and services, to provide features available on the Website, to operate and improve our
        products and services, for market research, to analyze the Website, and to ensure the
        technical functionality and security of the Website.

        Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer, your computer operating system and type
        of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information may be
        used to analyze overall trends, determine the domain from which you came, who visits
        the Website, to understand the needs of Website visitors, or to help us improve the
        INXPO service.

about you; or (3) opt out of receiving electronic direct marketing communications from us,
please contact us at privacy@inxpo.com.
E. Sharing of Personal Data With Third Parties.
We share Personal Data about you with third parties for the purposes detailed below. Please note
that this Policy does not apply to third parties, INXPO is not responsible for the privacy practices
of third parties, and that you should consult the respective privacy policies of third parties for
more information on their practices.
    1. To Conduct Our Business. INXPO shares Personal Data with consent or as necessary to
        complete any transaction or provide any product or service requested or authorized.

        faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with laws or regulations, a
        subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process. We
        may disclose Personal Data in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that
        disclosing Personal Data is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against
        someone who may be violating our Terms of Use or other user agreement, or to protect
        the safety or security of our users, the Website or the general public.
                                                   4


    3. Sale of Business. We reserve the right to transfer Personal Data to a third-party in the
         event of a sale, merger or other transfer of all or substantially all of our assets, provided
         that the third-party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
F. Security & Data Integrity.
INXPO takes reasonable steps to prevent the loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure,
alteration and destruction of Personal Data about you. In addition, INXPO takes appropriate
security measures to safeguard Personal Data about you once we have received it. Despite these
efforts to store Personal Data collected on and through the Website and otherwise by us in a
secure operating environment that is not available to the public, we cannot guarantee the security
of Personal Data during its transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt
to ensure the integrity and security of Personal Data, we cannot guarantee that our security
measures will prevent third-parties such as so-called hackers from illegally obtaining access to
Personal Data. We do not warrant or represent that Personal Data about you will be protected
against, loss, misuse, or alteration by third parties.
G. Your California Privacy Rights.
California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users that are residents of California to request
certain information regarding INXPO’s disclosures of Personal Data to third parties for such
third parties’ direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make
such a request, please email INXPO at privacy@inxpo.com.
The California Online Privacy Protection Act (“CalOPPA”) requires INXPO to disclose how it
responds to Do Not Track Signals in your web browser. INXPO does not interpret or respond to
Do Not Track Signals. You may set your web browser to not accept new cookies or web
beacons or disable cookies altogether. Please note that doing so may hinder your experience on
the Website. Please see the Help section of your browser for instructions on managing security
preferences.
H. Children’s Privacy.
The Website is not directed to children younger than thirteen (13) years of age. We do not
intend to collect Personal Data from children under 13. If you are under 13, please do not use
the Website and do not send any information about yourself to us.
I. International Transfers of Personal Data.
Some elements of the Website and/or our products and services may be hosted on servers located

such countries may be different from those applicable in your home country. In particular, if you
are located within the European Union (the “EU”)/European Economic Area (the “EEA”) or
Switzerland, please note that Personal Data collected by us may be transferred outside those
countries. By using the Website or our products or services, you consent to Personal Data about
you being transferred outside your own country and, where applicable, outside the EU, EEA or

                                                    5


J. European Union and Swiss Data Transfer and Protection.
INXPO complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
Frameworks as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of Personal Data from the EU and/or Switzerland. INXPO has certified to the
Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles, including the
Supplemental Principles (collectively, the “Principles”). A violation of our commitment to the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield may be investigated by the Federal
Trade Commission and/or the United States Department of Commerce. INXPO will only
reference its compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and/or the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield
when it is in compliance with the Principles. INXPO confirms that it will process data from
Switzerland in the same fashion as it processes data from the European Union. Therefore,
INXPO has included Switzerland in the subsequent text of this privacy policy. If there is any
conflict between the policies in this Policy and the Principles, the Principles shall govern. To
learn more about the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield programs, and
to view our certification page, to the extent available, please visit https://www.privacyshield.gov.
This Privacy Shield Policy supplements, but does not replace, all other policies, practices, and
procedures at INXPO, including any confidentiality agreements, privacy notices, or other
agreements, as well as applicable laws. INXPO affirms that while it understands that
certification to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield is voluntary,
effective compliance is compulsory. The Principles apply to INXPO immediately upon
certification.
INXPO remains responsible and liable under the Principles if third-party agents that it engages to
process Personal Data on its behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, unless
INXPO proves that it is not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.
In compliance with the Principles, INXPO commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and
our collection or use of Personal Data about you within 45 days. Persons from the EU and
Switzerland who have inquiries or complaints regarding this Statement should first contact us via
email at: privacy@inxpo.com.
If an issue cannot be resolved by INXPO’s internal dispute resolution mechanism, INXPO has
chosen JAMS to be its independent recourse mechanism for the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the
Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield. INXPO agrees to be bound by any decision of JAMS. Individuals
may contact JAMS at https://www.jamsadr.com/eu-us-privacy-shield to address complaints.
More information about JAMS is available at http://www.jamsadr.com. In the event that INXPO
or JAMS determines that INXPO did not comply with this Policy, INXPO will take appropriate
steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance. Under certain
circumstances, individuals may invoke binding arbitration before the Privacy Shield Panel for
residual claims not otherwise resolved. In the event INXPO becomes subject to an order for
non-compliance with the Principles, INXPO shall make public any relevant sanctions or other
findings.
Any human resources data complaints can be addressed to the relevant EU data protection
authorities (“DPAs”) directly. INXPO will cooperate and comply with any decision of a DPA.
                                                  6


Please contact INXPO (see contact information below) to be directed to the relevant DPA.
Additionally, with respect to complaints concerning human resources data that is transferred
from the EU to the United States, we have agreed to participate in the dispute resolution
procedures of the DPAs. Contact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm. INXPO will
cooperate with the appropriate DPAs during investigation and resolution of complaints
concerning human resources data that is transferred from the EU to the United States under the
Privacy Shield.
These recourse mechanisms are available at no cost to you. Damages may be awarded in
accordance with applicable law.
Under certain conditions, if you are not satisfied with the above recourse mechanisms, you may
be able to invoke binding arbitration.
In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU, EEA, or Swiss individuals received
pursuant to the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield or Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield, INXPO is potentially
liable.
K. Changes to the Policy.
From time to time we may change this Policy with or without prior notice to you. You can tell
when changes have been made to the Policy by referring to the “Last Updated” legend on top of
this page. Please review this Policy regularly to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we
materially change the ways in which we use and disclose Personal Data, we will post a notice on
the Website and send an e-mail to our registered users. Your continued use of the Website
and/or our products and services following any changes to this Policy constitutes your
acceptance of any such changes made.
