# INXPO Privacy Policy

                                         INXPO Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or “us”) treats personal
information when you, the user, access the INXPO website (“INXPO Website” or “Website”). This Privacy
Policy only applies to information collected by INXPO, and does not apply to any information collected by
any third party. By visiting the INXPO Website you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, as they may be
amended from time to time.
The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data
protection principles (the "Safe Harbor Principles") to enable U.S. Companies to satisfy the requirement
under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU
to the United States. INXPO adheres to Safe Harbor Principles and applies those principles to any transfer of
information between the European Union countries and INXPO.
A. Type of Information INXPO Collects.
The INXPO Website does not collect personally identifiable information from you unless you choose to
enter personally identifiable information into a registration or similar page. Before collecting personal
information, INXPO gives you notice and the choice to opt out of providing such information. If you choose
not to provide any requested personal information, you may be unable to access certain areas of the INXPO
Website, such as password protected areas.
1. Registration Information. Certain areas of the INXPO Website may require you to input registration
    information, which may include your name, email address and other business or contact information in
    order to enter a password protected area or to receive further information about INXPO products or
    services.
2. Your Activities. INXPO may record information about your activities on and/or usage of the INXPO
    Website. Activity information may include which pages you visited, what URL you came from or visit
    after you leave the Website, average time spent on the Website, previously shared information, your
    domain or IP address etc. In addition, if you are logged into a password protected area, we may associate
    that information with your account. To accomplish this we may use:
        a. Cookies: a small text file which contains a string of alphanumeric characters and is used to
            collect information about website activity. There are two different types of cookies: Session
            cookies and persistent cookies. Session cookies are held temporarily and disappear when you
            close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your web browser on subsequent visits.
        b. Locally Shared Objects: Locally Shard Objects (LSO), also referred to as flash cookies. LSO’s
            are similar to cookies in that they are files which store data and collect information about website
            activity. LSO’s will recreate a cookie that's been deleted.
        c. Web Beacons: Web Beacons are strings of code placed on a webpage in conjunction with cookies.
            Web beacons are able to track the number of users that visit a website and, in conjunction with
            cookies, identify the IP address and personalize the website experience. Web Beacons may also
            be used to collect anonymous and/or aggregate, unidentifiable information such as how many
            users attended a virtual event.
        d. URL and IP Address: the URL is the web page you came from or leave the INXPO website to.
            The IP address is the numerical label associated with the location of your computing device.


3. Content. Any personal information or content that you voluntarily upload or otherwise disclose while on
    the INXPO Website (such as, through us of an INXPO blog), including but not limited to information
    disclosed on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within a profile page, or images or any other
    content you provide (“Content”), becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others. In
    addition, if you are given the ability to log into your account with any social networking website, or post
    Content on such site or other third party website, through the INXPO Website, such Content may be
    made available to other parties and associated with your personally identifiable information.
B. Purposes for Which INXPO Collects Information.

    Website, INXPO may use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide you with the
    general and personalized features and functionality of the INXPO Website. We may also use such
    personal information to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us.
2. Messaging. Your account registration information may be displayed in password protected areas to other
    users. If you choose to receive email from INXPO, we may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons) in

    marketers.
