                                    INXPO Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes how INXPO, Inc. (either “INXPO,” “we,” or
“us”) treats personal information when you, the user, access the INXPO platform, mobile
application or website (“INXPO Website” or “Website”). This Privacy Policy only applies
to information collected by INXPO, and does not apply to any information collected by
any third party. By visiting the INXPO Website you agree to the terms of this Privacy
Policy, as they may be amended from time to time.
A. Cookies Policy
1. What is a Cookie? A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique
identifier that is placed on your computer or on your mobile phone (collectively referred to
herein as a "device") browser from a website's computer and is stored on your device's hard
drive. There are two different types of cookies: session cookies and persistent cookies.
Session cookies are held temporarily and disappear when you close your browser. Persistent
cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits. Cookies are widely used to
provide certain features of website, to make websites perform more efficiently, and to
provide information to the owners of the website. Each INXPO event and/or webcast can
send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it. INXPO does not
use cookies to collect personally identifiable information about you.
2. What is a Local Shared Object (Flash Cookie)? INXPO uses both the Adobe Flash
Player and Silverlight players to deliver its video content services. To improve user
experience, Local Shared Objects (otherwise known as Flash or Silverlight Cookies or
LSOs) are used to provide features such as auto-resume and for saving your preferences.
Flash and Silverlight Cookies are stored on a user's terminal much the same as cookies are,
however it is not possible to manage them at browser level in the same way.
3. How to Disable Flash Cookies. The Adobe website provides comprehensive information
on how to delete or disable Flash cookies either for a specific domain like bbc.co.uk or for
all websites.        See http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/security for more
information. Please be aware that restricting the use of Flash cookies may affect the
features available to you for Flash-based applications on the Website and within INXPO
events and presentations.
4. How to Disable Silverlight Cookies. The Microsoft Silverlight website provides
directions       on      how       to     remove      Silverlight     cookies.          See
http://www.ehow.com/how_5972751_remove-silverlight-cookies.html                 for    more
information. Please be aware that restricting the use of Silverlight cookies may affect the
features available to you for Silverlight-based applications on the Website and within
INXPO events and presentations.
5. How to Control and Delete Cookies. For events and webcasts, cookies record
information about your online preferences and allow us to present content to your interests.

cookies and/or set your device to not receive cookies, certain personalised features cannot
be provided to you, and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of
the Website's features. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your
browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences in your browser.
6. INXPO Cookies. In some cases, INXPO may use cookies, Flash and Silverlight
Cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not
have to reenter it during your visit or the next time you visit the event; (b) provide customer,
personalized content and information; or (c) monitor aggregate metrics such as total
number of visitors, pages, viewed, and similar information. Below is a list of the main
cookies set by INXPO, and what each is used for:
