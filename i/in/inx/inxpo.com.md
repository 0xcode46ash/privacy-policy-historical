Your privacy is important to us. We want to earn and keep your trust; the following principles outline our commitment to you:

We will never rent or sell your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission. Exhibitors, any person or company whose invitation to attend you responded to, and event sponsors are not third parties for this purpose.

We will never share your contact information with another user, unless both of you choose to contact one another.

Any sensitive information that you provide will be secured with all industry standard protocols and technology.

Information Collection

Registration:  
In order to become an InXpo attendee, you must first create an account on this web site. To create an account you are required to provide the following contact information: name, email address, country, ZIP/postal code), a brief summary of your professional background (current occupation & networking objectives), and choose a password.

Profile Information:  
Once an attendee, you may provide additional information in the Profile section describing your skills, professional experiences, and networking objectives. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables you to better identify yourself and find new opportunities in the InXpo system. 

Cookies & Log Files:

Like most web sites, InXpo uses cookies and web log files to track site usage. A cookie is a tiny data file which resides on your computer which allows InXpo to recognize you as a user when you return to our site using the same computer and web browser. Unfortunately, if your browser settings do not allow cookies, you will not be able to use our website. Like the information you enter at registration or in your Profile, cookie and log file data is used to customize your experience on the web site.

One type of cookie, known as a “persistent” cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your InXpo account. The next time you visit the InXpo web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so you will not need to log in before using the service. Additionally, if you log out of the InXpo site you will need to re-enter your password the next time you visit in order to log in to your account. Another type of cookie, called a “session” cookie, is used to identify a particular visit to the InXpo site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when you visit the InXpo web site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave InXpo. We also receive the Internet protocol (IP) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, as well as the name of your ISP. This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the InXpo service, but is not linked to personally identifiable information in any way.

Children:  
Children are not eligible to use our service and we ask that minors (under the age of 18) do not submit any personal information to us or use the service.

Information Use  
InXpo is an online service dedicated to helping all types of professionals more effectively connect with one another. The information you choose to provide on this site is used to help you describe yourself to other users. In addition, InXpo collects certain types of information in order to operate and improve our service to you and other users. InXpo, LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on this site.

Communications:  
InXpo will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. These include a series of welcome e-mails which help inform new users about various features of the service. Please be aware that you will always receive certain emails from InXpo related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user sends you an opportunity. InXpo may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. If you wish to opt-out of receiving promotional emails, please send a request to info@InXpo.com.

Customized Content:  
Information you provide at registration or in your Profile section is also used to customize your experience on the web site. 

Information Sharing

Sharing Information With Third Parties:  
InXpo takes the privacy of our users very seriously. We will never sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to any third parties for marketing purposes. Exhibitors, sponsors, and the person or company that invited you are not considered third parties. We will only share your information with third parties to carry out your instructions and to provide specific services. For instance, we use a credit card processing company to bill users for subscription fees. These third parties do not retain, share, or store any personally identifiable information except to provide these services and are bound by strict confidentiality agreements which limit their use of such information.

Partnering with Other Organizations to Offer Combined Services:  
InXpo partners with other online services to give you the combined results of both services. Whenever we offer such combined services, it will be clear who the partner is and it will be your choice to make use of the combined services or not. In these cases, none of your personally identifiable information will be passed from InXpo to the partner. 

Communications Between Users:  
Many emails and contacts you initiate through InXpo, an invitation sent to a non-user for instance, will list your email address and name in the header of the message. Your contact information will only be shared with another user if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.

Legal Disclaimer:  
It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information when required by law. We will disclose such information wherein we have a good-faith belief that it is necessary to comply with a court order, ongoing judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on our company or to exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

Accessing and Changing Your Account Information  
You can review the personal information you provided us and make any desired changes to the information, or to the settings for your InXpo account, at any time by logging in to your account on the InXpo website and editing the information on your Profile page. You can also close your account through the InXpo website. 

Security  
Private information like your address or credit card number can be accessed only by providing your password.

Changes to this Privacy Policy  
InXpo may update this privacy policy. In the event there are significant changes in the way we treat your personal information, we will send a notice to the primary email address specified in your InXpo account or by displaying a prominent notice on this site.
