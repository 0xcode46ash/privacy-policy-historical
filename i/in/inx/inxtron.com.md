# Privacy Policy | inXtron, Inc.

inXtron is committed to protect our customer's privacy. This statement is meant to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personally identifiable information. inXtron will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the applicable laws.

#### Information Collected

As a standard practice, inXtron assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times folks are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those folks are (unless they specifically tell us). We analyze this data for trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. We also gather information about what folks are searching for. We use all this information in order to improve our content, plan site enhancements, and measure overall site effectiveness, and therefore to make the site better and more hopefully fitting to your needs.

#### Transaction Information

When you order products from inXtron, we may ask you to complete an order form that requests certain information from you, including financial information such as a credit card number and expiration date and general contact details. We use this information to complete the transaction that you have requested, i.e. to deliver information, products or other services that you order and to invoice you. (We do not store your credit card information.)

#### Cookies

This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie". Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: unless you specifically tell us. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.)

#### And Finally

inXtron may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law.

inXtron may modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time, so we encourage you to review this policy from time to time.

If you have any queries about this policy please feel free to contact us.
