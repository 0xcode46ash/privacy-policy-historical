**Information We Collect**   


At IN THE HOLE! Golf, we respect the privacy of our customers. We collect only the information that is necessary to process your order and notify you of any changes to your order. Your information is **_never_** shared, sold, rented, leased or given to any third parties.   


**Email Addresses**

**Cookies**   


We do capture cookies in order for us to keep track of the items you place in your shopping cart. The "cookie" does not tell us who you are, or any other personal information about you. It only allows us to keep track of items in your shopping cart.   


**Security**   


We strive to ensure that shopping online at intheholegolf.com is more secure than using your credit card at a local retailer. IN THE HOLE! Golf uses 128 Bit Secure Sockets Layering (SSL) to encrypt your personal information, before it travels over the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. Because we use SSL, placing an order online is just as safe as giving your credit card number over the telephone. Consumer protection laws protect you against any unauthorized use of your credit card. Federal law dictates that your legal liability is limited to $50 if your credit card number is used without your permission. If you suspect any illegal use of your card, call your issuing bank immediately to make sure your rights are protected.
