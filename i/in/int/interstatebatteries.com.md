**IMPORTANT—PLEASE READ**

 

**Privacy Policy**

**Incorporation into Conditions of Use**

This privacy policy (this “ **Policy** ”) is incorporated in, and subject to, the _[Conditions of Use](http://www.interstatebatteries.com/cs_eStore/ContentNet/legal.aspx)_ (the “ **Conditions of Use** ”) for Interstate Batteries’ website (the “ **Site** ”). Please refer to the Conditions of Use for definitions of words with initial capitals letters that are not otherwise defined in this Policy.

IB reserves the right, in IB’s sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of this Policy at any time without notice to you. You should read this Policy periodically for changes. If you use the Site after IB posts changes to this Policy, you are deemed to have accepted the changed Policy. This Policy was last changed on October 29th, 2010.

 

**Information Collection and Submission**

When you visit the Site, you acknowledge that you may be providing IB with two specific types of information: (i) information that you provide which personally identifies you or your business (“ **Personally Identifiable Information** ”) and (ii) information that you provide, or that we collect as you interact with the Site, which does not personally identify you or your business (“ **Site-Use Information** ”).

__Personally Identifiable Information__. Throughout the Site, you may voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information that personally identifies you. For example, the Site may ask you to voluntarily submit Personally Identifiable Information if you request information regarding IB’s products or services, attempt to purchase any product or service from the Site, or register for the Site. Personally Identifiable Information includes, but is not limited to, your (a) name, (b) company’s name, (c) department, (d) physical address, (e) phone number, (f) fax number, (g) e-mail address, and (h) billing information.

__Site-Use Information__. To help IB tailor the Site to the needs and interests of the Site’s visitors, IB may collect various types of Site-Use Information that do not identify you personally. For example, when you visit the Site, IB’s server, through the use of tracking devices, may collect Site-Use Information pertaining to you, including, but not limited to, your IP address, the length of time you spend on the Site, which pages you visited within the Site, which site you visited before coming to the Site, and which site you accessed when you left the Site.

 

**Cookies**

IB reserves the right to place a text file called a “cookie” (or a piece of information transferred to your hard disk for record keeping purposes) in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain information that would personally identify you, although it could enable IB to relate your use of the Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided to the Site.

 

**Interaction Services**

The Site may provide Interaction Services, including bulletin board services, chat areas, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to interact with others. IB does not control the messages, information, or files delivered to, or received from, the Interaction Services.

 

**Permitted Disclosures**

Notwithstanding any provision of this Policy to the contrary, IB reserves the right at all times, and without needing further permission from you, to (i) disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any law, regulation, governmental or law enforcement request, or discovery order or (ii) edit, refuse to post, or remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, that, in IB’s sole discretion, are objectionable or in violation of this Policy.

 

**Security**

IB uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, human, and physical measures to protect your Personally Identifiable Information (including credit card information) in IB’s possession against loss and theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. In addition, IB uses commercially reasonable methods to ensure that your Personally Identifiable Information is accurate, up-to-date, and appropriately complete within IB’s systems. You warrant that you shall do the same. However, IB cannot guarantee that any electronic commerce is totally secure. For example, IB has no control over the information collected by your Internet service provider or your employer (if the Site is made available to you through your employer or if you send Personally Identifiable Information to IB through your employer-provided email account), or information that you disclose in a public forum. Any such third party that collects your Personally Identifiable Information may use the information in accordance with its terms and conditions of use (and related privacy policies), which may be different from this Policy. IB is not responsible for any information collected by such third parties and/or how such information is used or maintained. Neither any third party nor IB has the authority to make any representations or commitments on behalf of the other.

 

**Consent**

By using the Site, you are consenting to have your personal data, including your Personally Identifiable Information, transferred to, and processed in, the United States pursuant to this Policy. The Site is hosted in the United States. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, then you may choose that your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue using the Site immediately.

 

**Links To Other Sites**

The Site may contain links to other sites not owned or operated by IB. Those other sites may not have the same privacy policy as IB, and IB is not responsible for the privacy practices of those other sites. When you visit those other sites, you should read their privacy policies. This Policy applies solely to information collected by IB.

 

**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**

Except as described in this Policy, IB will obtain your permission before IB (i) uses your Personally Identifiable Information in a way that is inconsistent with the purpose for which it was submitted or (ii) shares your Personally Identifiable Information with third parties that are not affiliated with IB. IB will only use the Personally Identifiable Information you provide us in a manner that is consistent with this Policy.

IB may periodically use your email address to send you promotional materials related to IB’s products and services. If you want to stop receiving such materials from IB, you should follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of each email.

IB’s employees, agents, and contractors must have a business reason to obtain access to your Personally Identifiable Information. IB may share your Personally Identifiable Information with (i) those who help IB manage or provide the Site or process functionality offered by the Site (for example, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, data processing, and credit card purchases) or (ii) outside contractors, agents, or sponsors who help IB with the administration and maintenance of the Site or process functionality offered by the Site (for example, credit card purchases). These outside contractors, agents, or sponsors may temporarily store some information on their servers (such as credit card information), but they may only use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide IB with a specific service and not for any other purpose. IB may also provide your Personally Identifiable Information to a third party in those instances where you have chosen to receive certain information and have been notified that the fulfillment of such a request requires the sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information.

There may be instances when IB may access or disclose your Personally Identifiable Information or other information provided or posted by you without providing you a choice in order to (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of (a) IB, (b) any of our affiliated companies, or (c) an outside contractor or such contractor’s employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements), (ii) protect the safety and security of users of the Site or members of the public, including acting in urgent circumstances, (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes, or (iv) comply with the law or legal process or request by a law enforcement agency. In addition, if IB sells all or part of IB’s business or makes a sale or transfer of all or a material part of IB’s assets or equity or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of IB’s business, which IB may do at IB’s sole discretion and without requiring your consent, IB may transfer your Personally Identifiable Information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction.

 

**Modification of Personally Identifiable Information**

We will take commercially reasonable steps to correct any Personally Identifiable Information if you inform us that it is incorrect.

 

**To Stop Use of Personally Identifiable Information**

If you ask IB in writing to stop using your Personally Identifiable Information, IB will honor that request while retaining any record of your Personally Identifiable Information that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state, or local law or discovery request.

 

**Site-Use Information**

IB is permitted to use the Site-Use Information in IB’s discretion. Accordingly, IB reserves the right to aggregate Site-Use Information with information collected from other visitors of the Site to track overall visitor traffic patterns, which will allow IB to develop statistics that are helpful to understanding how visitors use the Site. IB may also use Site-Use Information (i) to monitor, maintain, and improve the functionality of the Site, making it more responsive to the needs of the Site’s visitors, and (ii) for historical, statistical, scientific, or other purposes. IB further reserves the right to use, sell, and assign for any and all purposes all Site-Use Information; and you authorize IB to use, sell, and assign, for any and all purposes, all Site-Use Information.

 

**Children's Policy**

IB does not intend to collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children through the Site. Please do not allow children under the age of 13 to provide any Personally Identifiable Information, ask questions, or submit information via the Site. If IB determines that a child under 13 has provided Personally Identifiable Information, IB will delete that Personally Identifiable Information as soon as practicable.
