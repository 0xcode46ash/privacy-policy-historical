Intelligence Careers recognizes that some of the information contained in resumes for information intelligence professionals may be sensitive or contain potentially proprietary information. Intelligence Careers does not take responsibility for what is contained within resumes. Resume content is the liability of the resume writer. Access to resumes and identifying information associated with resumes is granted only at the level agreed to by the resume owner. The default release is all identifying information with anonymity options offered at the time of resume submission. 

Resumes can be editted online by resume owners via a login and password protected interface. Post-submission changes can be requested by contacting [webmaster@intelligencecareers.com](mailto:webmaster@intelligencecareers.com) .

The confidentiality of material posted within the Information and Intelligence Skills Database (IISD) on the Internet _cannot_ be guaranteed. It should be expected that any resume information can potentially be viewed by anyone with access to the  Internet. To meet the concern for security and privacy there are a number of protective measures used to include allowing the assignment of anonymous identifiers to resumes listings, etc. Identifying information associated with anonymous resumes is never stored on the Internet. Should you have some specific concern please bring this to the attention of [webmaster@intelligencecareers.com](mailto:webmaster@intelligencecareers.com) .

Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used to protect all financial transactions, and is an option for submitting resume information.
