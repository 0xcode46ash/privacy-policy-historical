####  How We Use Personally Identifiable Information Collected

We use personally identifying information we collect on any the Site for the following purposes: 

  * to allow you to create an account and profile;
  * to enable you to provide feedback, to contact us and for us to respond to you;
  * to provide information about you and your potential interest in job postings to employer customers; 
  * to provide products and services to employer customers to complete the recruitment and hiring process, such as accessing the searchable resume database; 
  * to communicate with you with regard to your use of the Site and its services or to advise you of Site changes or other events or occurrences which may affect your access to or use of the Site; 
  * to compile information and statistics surrounding internships

  * for other purposes specifically communicated to you when we collect the information. 



If you choose to publish your profile, upload or create a resume or any other document containing personal information so that employers can find you in the InternMatch.com database, your personal profile information and resume will be searchable by and accessible to employers who have access to those databases. Please note that for uploaded resumes on our website, they must not contain sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin (ii) political beliefs (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs (iv) membership of a trade union or political party (v) physical or mental health or genetic makeup (vi) addictions, sexual life (vii) the commission of criminal offences or proceedings and associated penalties or fines, or (viii) any Social Security Number or state or national identification number. In addition, if you provide us with details of a professional reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have forwarded his/her details and has consented in writing for you to do so. 

While we endeavor to restrict access to these databases to eligible employers, we cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to these databases as well. Within your profile, under the settings tab, you can make your resume and other information private from our database at any time. You can also contact us to remove your entire account and profile at any time. However, employers and recruiters who have access to these databases, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to these databases may have retained a copy of your profile or resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes or other personal information of Users by any of such parties. 

With your permission, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information to send you articles, profiles, industry news and other career related information, as well as to notify you of special promotions or additional products and services offered by us or our business partners and advertisers that may be of interest to you. You have the ability to opt-out of these types of communications both in your profile and in every individual email we send you. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, street address, email or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

On occasion we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide services to us. 

From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm. We may also disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, if Internships becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, Internships or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. 

All Users should be aware that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their e-mail address) to others (whether in chat rooms, message boards or discussion forums, by posting internships, responding to employers message or otherwise), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not responsible. 

####  Updating Account Information 

* * *

You can access your personally identifiable information that we collect and maintain on the Site by visiting your dashboard and settings tab after logging into your account. From here you can review, correct, or delete personal information at any time. 

####  Cookies 

* * *

## Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve the overall Site experience. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). 

You can one turn off or delete cookies in your browser settings; however, this may affect your use of the site. 

####  Data Security 

* * *

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

InternMatch will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. 

InternMatch will store all the personal information you provide on its secure servers. 

####  Phishing 

* * *

Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to InternMatch. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. 

####  Children 

* * *

This Site is not directed to children under 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 as permitted by law. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personal Information without their consent, he or she should contact us at InternMatch 2404 42nd Ave. E. Suite 207 Seattle WA 98112 or [info@internmatch.com](mailto:info@internmatch.com) . We will then make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our records. 

####  Your California Rights 

* * *

A California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. 

However, under the law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. 

As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. 

California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing [info@internmatch.com](mailto:info@internmatch.com) . Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address. 

####  Privacy Policy Changes 

* * *

InternMatch may update this privacy policy by posting a new version on this website. You should check this page occasionally to ensure you are familiar with any changes. Accordingly, we reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time by posting the revised policy on this Site. Information will be handled according to the privacy policy in effect at the time the information is used. Your continued use of our Sites following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean you accept those changes.
