####  How We Use Information We Collect 

* * *

Except as described in this Policy, we do not disclose, display or share your personal information to or with third parties without your permission. In general, InternMatch uses personal information it collects to pursue our mission and operations, including the management of the Sites and to engage in related activities. We reserve the right, but do not undertake a duty, to notify you of court orders, subpoenas or other legal process if allowed. If you do not want us to respond to legal process compelling us to disclose your information, you need to seek a valid order permitting us to refuse to disclose it and serve the order on us at least three (3) business days before the response deadline. 

We reserve the right to use, disclose, retain, share, or otherwise deal with all information collected on the Sites internally or to third parties for the following purposes: 

  * to allow you to create an account and profile;
  * to enable you to provide feedback, to contact us and for us to respond to you;
  * to provide information about you and your potential interest in job postings to employer customers; 
  * to provide products and services to employer customers to complete the recruitment and hiring process, such as accessing the searchable resume database; 
  * to communicate with you regarding your use of the Sites and its services or to advise you of changes to the Sites or other events or occurrences which may affect your access to or use of the Sites; 
  * to compile information and statistics surrounding internships
  * to administer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, questionnaires, polling activities and other similar events and activities that you choose to participate in; 
  * to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; 
  * to prevent fraud or other illegal activity, to prevent imminent bodily harm, or to protect ourselves and you from people violating our Terms of Service, which may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, courts or other government entities; and 
  * for other purposes specifically communicated to you when we collect the information. 



If you choose to publish your profile, upload or create a resume or any other document containing personal information so that employers can find you in the InternMatch.com database, your personal profile information and resume will be searchable by and accessible to employers who have access to those databases. Your profile may also be indexed by internet search engines such as Google or Bing and be accessible to others who are not users of the Sites. If you do not want this information to be publicly available, please do not publish your profile. Please note that any resumes uploaded onto the Sites MUST NOT contain any sensitive data relating to your (i) racial or ethnic origin; (ii) political beliefs; (iii) philosophical or religious beliefs; (iv) membership in a trade union or political party; (v) physical or mental health or genetic makeup; (vi) addictions or sexual activities or habits; (vii) the commission of crimes or legal proceedings and associated penalties or fines; or (viii) any Social Security Number or state or national identification number. In addition, if you provide us with details of a professional reference, it is your responsibility to ensure that the person is aware that you have provided us with his or her details and the professional reference has consented in writing for you to do so. 

While we endeavor to restrict access to these databases to eligible employers, we cannot guarantee that other parties will not, without our consent, gain access to these databases as well. Within your profile, under the Settings tab, you can make your resume and other information private from our database at any time. You can also contact us to remove your entire account and profile at any time. However, employers and recruiters who have access to these databases, and other parties who have otherwise gained access to these databases may have retained a copy of your profile or resume in their own files or databases. We are not responsible for the retention, use or privacy of resumes in these instances, or for the use or privacy of resumes or other personal information of Users by any of such parties. 

With your permission, we may use your e-mail address and other contact information to send you articles, profiles, industry news and other career related information, as well as to notify you of special promotions or additional products and services offered by us or our business partners and advertisers that may be of interest to you. You have the ability to opt-out of these types of communications both in your profile and in every individual email we send you. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Sites. These companies may use information (not including your name, street address, email or telephone number) about your visits to the Sites and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

On occasion we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include hosting our web servers, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These other companies will have access to your personal information as necessary to perform their functions, but they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide services to us. 

From time to time, we may also disclose personally identifiable information to fulfill certain legal and regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent or mitigate harm. We may also disclose and transfer such information to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by merger, consolidation or purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets. In addition, if InternMatch becomes the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding, whether voluntary or involuntary, InternMatch or its trustee in bankruptcy may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in a transaction approved by the bankruptcy court. 

You should be aware that by voluntarily displaying or distributing personal information (such as your e-mail address) to others (whether in chat rooms, message boards or discussion forums, by posting internships, responding to employers’ message or otherwise), your information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which we are not responsible. 

####  Updating Account Information

## Cookies

We may use small text files called cookies to improve your overall experience with the Sites. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies generally do not permit us to personally identify you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, when you register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information (such as user name, password and preferences). 

You can one turn off or delete cookies in your browser settings; however, this may affect your use of the Sites.

Each of those provisions applies to any disputes that may arise in relation to this Policy and the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information and are of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this Policy. 

####  Data Security 

* * *

Keeping secure the personal information that we collect is of great concern to us. We exercise care in providing secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers in connection with the Sites. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.InternMatch will take reasonable technical and organizational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information. 

InternMatch will store all the personal information you provide on its secure servers. While InternMatch has mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

####  Phishing 

* * *

Identity theft and the practice known as "phishing" are of great concern to InternMatch. Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will not, at any time, request your credit card information, your account ID, login password, or national identification numbers in a non-secure or unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. 

####  Children

The Sites are not intended for use by children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 as permitted by law. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personal information without their consent, he or she should contact us at InternMatch (425 2nd St. Suite 201, San Francisco, CA 94107) or [info@internmatch.com.](mailto:info@internmatch.com) We will then make reasonable efforts to delete the child's information from our records. 

####  Your California Rights 

* * *

The following section of this Policy is only applicable to InternMatch users who are also residents of California. 

Any resident of the state of California who has provided personal information to a business with whom he or she has established a business relationship for personal, family, or household purposes ("California Customer") is entitled to request information about whether the business has disclosed their personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. In general, if the business has made such a disclosure of personal information, upon receipt of a request by a California Customer, the business is required to provide a list of all third parties to whom personal information was disclosed in the preceding calendar year, as well as a list of the categories of personal information that were disclosed. 

However, under applicable state law, a business is not required to provide the above-described lists if the business adopts and discloses to the public (in its privacy policy) a policy of not disclosing California Customer’s personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless the customer first affirmatively agrees to the disclosure, as long as the business maintains and discloses this policy. Rather, the business may comply with the law by notifying the California Customer of his or her right to prevent disclosure of personal information and providing a cost free means to exercise that right. 

As stated above, we do not share information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes unless you affirmatively agree to such disclosure. If you do ask us to share your information with a third party for its marketing purposes, we will only share information in connection with that specific promotion, as we do not share information with any third party on a continual basis. To prevent disclosure of your personal information for use in direct marketing by a third party, do not opt-in to such use when you provide personally identifiable information on one of our sites. Please note that whenever you opt-in to receive future communications from a third party, your information will be subject to the third party's privacy policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly, as we have no control over how third parties use information. You should always review the privacy policy of any party that collects your information to determine how that entity will handle your information. 

California customers may request further information about our compliance with this law by e-mailing [info@internmatch.com](mailto:info@internmatch.com) . Please note that we are only required to respond to one request per customer each year, and we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through this e-mail address.

We reserve the right to change, amend, or modify this Policy at any time by posting the revised Policy on this site.
