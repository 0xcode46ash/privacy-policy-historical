# Privacy Policy

This website is managed by Internet Marketing UpstartÂ with offices in Cape Town, South Africa (Please see our [contact page](http://internetmarketingupstart.com/contact-us/ "Contact Us") for more info) and we are committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors as is clearly stated within our privacy policy, which is as follows:

  1. We collect information from our online visitors by way of double confirmed opt-in which primarily includes first name, last name and email address, which enables us to provide useful and relevant information to our users, including regular newsletters, promotional offers and other correspondence.
  2. Our email contact list is managed by a third party service provider called [Aweber Communications](https://www.aweber.com/), who independently audits and enforces all requirements of the law including but not limited to the [CAN SPAM ACT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN-SPAM_Act_of_2003).
  3. All of our email communication includes our full contact details as well as a fully working one click unsubscribe link, so that any of our contacts who no longer wish to receive communication from us can opt-out at any time.
  4. In addition to this our double confirmed opt-in system ensures that only those people who specifically requested information from us will end up on our list, as all requests to join our contact list need to be confirmed by the user.
  5. Finally, we will not give any information about you to others without your express permission.
