# Interclue: Privacy Policy

## The Interclue Privacy Policy 1.0, 27 Dec 2007

  1. 1\. General principles 
    1. Interclue Ltd has complete respect for your right to both privacy and security, and we believe that civilised people do not spy on other people's browsing habits.
  2. 2\. Anonymity 
    1. Usage of Interclue is 100% anonymous. We collect no personally identifiable information, and we do zero tracking of what pages you see and click. 
  3. 3\. Daily update check 
    1. The daily update check advises you of any new available Interclue versions. It can be disabled in the options under "Advanced|Updates". As part of the update check, a unique ID is submitted to the interclue.com server. We use the unique ID so that we can track the number of active add-ons. The ID is randomly generated and contains no user identifiable data. As part of the update check, anonymous statistics may be submitted regarding features used and time saved, but this information is used only in aggregate form to help us determine how much time Interclue saves people and which options are found most and least useful. Even though this is completely anonymous, you can opt out on the privacy panel in the options. 
  4. 4\. No proxying. 
    1. Interclue does not operate a proxy service. All summary data comes direct from the target site. Eventually we will provide a proxy service â€” this will also be optional, and we will maintain it with the utmost possible level of privacy protection. 
  5. 5\. No recording. 
    1. The Interclue browser add-on does not record or transmit any information regarding the websites you visit back to us, except in the case of information you submit with a bug report, and we will only ever use that information in the process of addressing the bug you have reported.
  6. 6\. No spam. 
    1. The Interclue team hates, loathes and despises spam. We do not require you to give us your email address, and we will never send you unsolicited email. If you subscribe to one of our discussion or announcement mailing lists, unsubscribing will be just as easy.
  7. 7\. Optional use of live third-party metadata. 
    1. To provide you with valuable third-party metadata, it is necessary to send the URL you are interested in to the metadata provider. Interclue does not submit any personally identifiable information along with this, but the metadata provider may be using their own cookies in some cases. These providers are separated out on the metaclue options tab, and any site that is on your "private" list (which by default includes secure sites and local network IP addresses) does not have URLs submitted to third-party metadata services. 
  8. 8\. Our website. 
    1. We log information regarding usage of our website, as do most websites, but again this is anonymous data used only in the aggregate to help guide our site development.
  9. 9\. Evolution. 
    1. Interclue is an evolving product. By installing the add-on, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy as it may be amended from time to time. We cannot email you when the terms change, because we do not collect your email addresses, but we will announce it on our blog and elsewhere, make a note in the changelog, and update the date on the policy, which is also available on the "About" tab of the options dialog in the Interclue add-on.
