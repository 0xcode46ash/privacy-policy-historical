**International Plastics Privacy Policy

General

All information that you provide is for our use only and will be held in strict confidence. We will not sell, trade or pass on any personal or business information provided by our clients.  We require only the personal or corporate information that is needed for safe processing of your online order and for contacting you about your transactions. It is used exclusively for that purpose. Once you become a customer, you may receive, from time to time,  important reminders. If you would prefer not to receive these, please contact us or edit your InterPlas.com account settings to disable such notices.  
 

Purchasing Security

For your protection, certain orders will be required to have "signed-off proofs" to ensure acurate processing.  For this, some artwork or logos may be shared with third-party plate manufacturers.  International Plastics is self-assessed as PCI DSS 1.2 secure for protection of your credit card security.  No unencrpted wireless communication is ever used at International Plastics.  
 

Ship Tracking

In order to ship and track merchandise, we make your name and address available to such companies as United Parcel Service, Fedex, LTL Freight Carriers, and the U.S. Postal Service.  In no instance are these business affiliates allowed to use your personal information for purposes other than shipment delivery.

Website Cookies

For orders place over the web, we use cookies for your convenience which only identifies a unique connection between our systems.  Interplas.com cookies contain  absolutely no personal information.
