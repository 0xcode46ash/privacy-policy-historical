  * To provide the ability to create personal profile areas and view protected content.
  * To provide the ability to contact you, and provide you with shipping and billing information.

## Sharing your personal information

In some instances, Intel may collect non-personal (aggregate or demographic) data through cookies, web logs, and web beacons. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance, and effectiveness of the Intel.com website.

We may share your personal information within Intel or any of our worldwide subsidiaries for purposes of data processing or storage.

We may also share your personal information with authorized third-party agents or contractors in order to provide a requested service or transaction. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third-party agents with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction.

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process by disclosing your personal information and other related information, if necessary. We also may choose to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We may collect and possibly share personal information and any other additional information available to us in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Intel's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

While navigating Intel's web site you may be directed to content or functionality that is hosted by a third party supplier, not on Intel.com. This is typically done to host special events, such as contests. When information is collected on behalf of Intel exclusively, Intel's privacy policy will be referenced on the site and will govern how your information is used. For other, non-Intel sites, the site owner's privacy policy will be referenced. It is Intel's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Intel's privacy and security policies.

We will ask you for your opt-in consent to share your personal information with a third party for any other reason.

## Security of your personal information

Intel is committed to protecting the personal information you share with us. We utilize a combination of security technologies, procedures, and organizational measures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

When we transfer sensitive personal data (for example, credit card information) over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology.

While we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure the security of the information you transmit.

We recommend you to take every precaution in protecting your personal information when you are on the Internet. For example, change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers when creating passwords, and make sure you use a secure browser.

## Cookies

Intel websites utilize cookies, although you can still access most of them even if you choose to disable cookies in your browser. Some websites will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. For example, our consumer e-commerce site (i.e. ShopIntelSM) uses session cookies and persistent cookies to process transactions. If you do not accept cookies, the associated shopping basket will not work and you will not be able to place an order.

We use multiple third parties to monitor web traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-through', and other activities on Intel's sites. Where authorized by Intel, such third parties may use cookies, Intel's web log files, web beacons, and other monitoring technologies to compile anonymous aggregate statistics on Intel's website visitors.

We also include web beacons in HTML-formatted e-mail newsletters in order to count how many newsletters (or particular articles, links, etc.) are being accessed.

Current versions of web browsers offer enhanced user controls regarding the placement and duration of both first and third party cookies. Search for "cookies" under your web browser's Help menu for more information on cookie management features available to you.

## Children's privacy

Intel does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems. Intel encourages parents and guardians to go online with their children. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

  * Teach children never to give personal information (such as name, address, phone number, school, etc.) unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult.
  * Know the sites your children are visiting and which sites are appropriate.
  * Look for website privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.



Please visit the [FTC's website](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/edcams/kidzprivacy/index.html) for more tips on protecting children's privacy online.
