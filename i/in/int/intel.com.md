# Personal Information Privacy Policy

| 

**Intel’s Online Privacy Policy**   


Your right to privacy is very important. We recognize that when you choose to provide us with information about yourself, you trust us to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to protect your personal information. Below is a summary of our policy. 

**What personal information do we collect?**  
In general, when you visit our websites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. 

Some of our sites require registration to access, although typically all that's requested is an e-mail address and some basic information about you, such as job function. 

There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, and provide you with services that we believe may be valuable to you. Some examples of information our websites collect are name, address and phone number. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive materials from us. If you sign up for an Intel electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list. 

If any of our websites are developed for children under the age of 13, we will encourage them to get their parents' permission before they give us any personal information. These websites will also encourage children to use nicknames, instead of their given names when and if personal information is collected. 

**Protecting your privacy**  
We will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. Whenever you provide sensitive information (for example, a credit card number to make a purchase), we will take reasonable steps to protect it, such as encrypting your card number. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for marketing purposes. 

We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Intel uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., customer support, or a shipping company if you have asked us to send something to you.) 

Our websites may provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third party sites. 

**Use of cookies**  
Intel websites use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the website are of interest to our visitors. These cookies do not track individual information. Intel also uses cookies when you register for one of our web programs. In this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our website to remember you when you return to visit us. Cookies from Intel websites can only be read by Intel websites. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our websites. 

**Data storage in the U.S.**  
Many of our websites that collect information will store and process that information in databases in the United States. 

**How can you update the personal information you have provided to Intel?**  
You can help Intel maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying Intel of any changes to your address, title, phone number or e-mail address. In some programs, you may do this online or through customer support by following the instructions on membership profile pages. You may also update your information by e-mailing [privacy@intel.com](mailto:privacy@intel.com) or at Privacy, Intel Corp., PO Box 5117, Janesville, WI, USA 53547-9923. If at any time you wish to stop receiving an electronic newsletter from Intel you can unsubscribe as explained in the newsletter or contact us at the above addresses. Please include your name, address, and e-mail address, and a description or example of any communication that you no longer wish to receive.
