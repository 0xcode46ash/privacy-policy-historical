# Intel Privacy Policy

Intel is committed to user privacy in our products and services. This policy outlines our personal information handling practices. If you give us personal information, we will treat it according to this policy. 

This policy covers Intel's corporate web sites. Some of our subsidiaries or programs have their own, possibly different, policies (see lists at right). 

Intel encourages you to read this privacy policy and those of all web sites you visit. Below is a summary of Intel's online privacy policy. 

**Types and uses of personal information.**  
Your personal information is used in the following ways: 

  * **User IDs and Passwords.** Provides you with access to your profile areas and to protected content. 
  * **Account Information.** These tell us more about who you are, how to contact you, and your shipping and billing information. Also contains any preferences you have provided, such as language, email format and interests. 
  * **Customer Feedback and Support.** Provides a mechanism for requesting information from Intel. Also used to tell us how we can improve our products, services and site designs. 
  * **Email Correspondence.** Used to raise and respond to issues and inquiries of all types. Also used to distribute information about Intel, our products, and services. 
  * **Transactions.** Shows which products and services you have requested. 



We will only use your personal information in the ways specified when it was collected. We will not subsequently change the way in which we use your personal information, unless you consent to the new usage. 

**Security measures.**  
We protect the personal information you share with us. For example, if you make an online purchase with us, we encrypt your credit card number. Access to your personal information is limited to people who need it to do their job. 

Authorized third party agents may also need access to some of your personal information. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. We only provide third party agents with the minimum amount of information needed to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not otherwise share your personal information with third parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. 

**Data Retention.**  
Intel will not retain your personal information longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected. 

**Linked web sites.**  
We provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control these Web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these (and all) third party sites. 

**Children's privacy.**  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. Intel encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer: 

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.

**Cookies.**  
Most Intel Web sites use _cookies_. Cookies help us provide a better user experience by measuring which Web site areas are of greatest interest. Intel also uses cookies when you register for one of our Web programs. In this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our Web site to remember you when you return. Intel can only read cookies from Intel Web sites. 

If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our Web sites. Some Web sites will not allow you to complete certain activities if cookies are disabled. For example, our consumer e-commerce site uses session cookies and persistent cookies to process transactions. If people you do not accept cookies, the associated shopping bag will not work and you would not be able to order. 

We may display advertisements from third parties. Third party ad-serving companies control which ads are shown. These ad-serving companies may use cookies to collect non-personally identifiable information from you. Advertisers use this information to target the ads and measure their impact. 

**Accessing and updating information.**  
We need your help in making sure your personal information is correct in our systems. Please notify us of changes to your name, address, title, phone number or email address. Most of our sites allow you to make these updates yourself via the program's member profile pages. 

**Unsubscribing.**  
Each email newsletter has instructions on how to unsubscribe. 

**Newsgroups / Forums.**  
Intel forums are public. Please consider this before posting. 

**Transfer of personal information to the U.S.**  
We may process or store your information in our U.S. databases.
