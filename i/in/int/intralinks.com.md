 **What information does IntraLinks collect through its public website, and how is this information used?**

IntraLinks collects certain personally identifiable information through its website when you choose to submit such information to us through email, an online form, or other method. You may provide IntraLinks with information in order to request additional information about IntraLinks' services, employment opportunities, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. We also collect information about website users through temporary "cookies" used to facilitate completion of online forms and other communications through the website. (For further information about cookies, please see below.) By providing this information, using the website or any of these communication tools, you consent to IntraLinks' use of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

IntraLinks also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to this website, including but not limited to a visitor's IP address (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access the website, the type of web browsers used to access the website, and the pages viewed.

We may use information collected through our website to respond to specific requests for information about our services and other inquiries. We may also use your information to inform you about other IntraLinks services that might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our services. If you decide to purchase our services, we may use your information for purposes of providing such services to you. [Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#top)

  
**What information does IntraLinks collect about users of its permissioned-based Service and how is this information used?**

This section applies to users of IntraLinks' permission-based On-Demand Workspace™ Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. The Service is an Internet-based hosted platform designed to enable business communities to share information through a central "hub". In this Privacy Policy, a "Workspace" means a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information relating to a specific business transaction or project. The manager of a Workspace, or your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to a Workspace will provide certain information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. We are not responsible for content and accuracy of the information that is provided by the manager of a Workspace. Using this information, we will provide you with a user ID and temporary password to access the Service and create a user "profile" for use as described below.

When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your "profile", which contains the information supplied to us, including your name, email address, organization, title and function, and telephone numbers (together, your "profile information"). You will be able to update or correct any of your profile information. By providing, updating, or accepting your profile information, you consent to our use of such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to consent to our use of your profile information, you will not be allowed to use the Service and should not agree to this Privacy Policy and the user agreement presented at the time you first log on.

Once your profile information has been entered into our system, this information is added to the participant list for each Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Workspace(s) may then have access to your profile information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.

Your profile information is also added to IntraLinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service. If you are selected to join another Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Workspace, and your profile information will be added to the participant list for that Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more "business groups," which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Workspaces that they have managed. Your profile information may be added to one or more of these business groups.

We may use your profile information to contact you regarding your and/or your company's use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service. You may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Workspace.

As a function of the Service, IntraLinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g., access to publications and comments, searches). IntraLinks also may maintain a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as "Usage Log Information".

Data regarding your access to and use of a Workspace will be available to managers and owners (licensees) of that Workspace, and may be provided to an employer whose systems are used by you to access the Service. Also, for purposes of maintaining and enhancing Service performance and security, IntraLinks may use Usage Log Information and make it available to managers and owners of the Workspaces you access. We may share information about your browser and other local computer settings with Workspace managers in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also may use this information internally to tailor our communications to you about the Service, subject to your right to join our "support-only" contact list (see below). We also may aggregate Usage Log Information to create or publish statistical analyses and reports about Service usage, it being understood we will not authorize the publication of personally identifiable information about any user without the prior written consent of such person.

In addition, as the global directory is a business asset of IntraLinks, if IntraLinks were sold to or merged with another company, the global directory (which includes your profile information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of IntraLinks, who agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request that your profile information be removed from the global directory at any time (see below). [Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#top)

  
**How does IntraLinks protect the security of the information I provide?**

We consider any information provided by you through our website to be confidential, unless it is publicly available or has already been provided to us without any confidentiality restriction. IntraLinks takes appropriate and reasonable precautions and has implemented appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of information provided through its website and Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use information you provide only to serve legitimate business and service needs consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, IntraLinks may disclose your profile information and other information collected about you (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule or other legal process; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property. 

We will obtain reasonable assurances from our agents, including, our hosting services vendor, that they will safeguard personal information knowingly collected by us concerning individuals residing in the European Union consistent with this Statement and the Safe Harbor Principles.

**How can I change, update, or delete my business contact and other profile information, or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?**

You can change or update your profile information at any time, regardless of whether you are a current or former user of the Service, by logging into the Service with your user ID and password and accessing your profile. All profile information except your name, company name, and email address can be changed by you through your profile. If you wish to change your name, company name, or email address as listed in your profile, you must call our Customer Service line for assistance.

You may request that we remove your profile information from our global directory. However, by doing so, you will automatically lose all access rights to the Service. You may have your profile information removed from the IntraLinks global directory by calling us at +1 888 546 5383. Please note that your profile information may be re-added to the global directory in the future if you are asked to participate in another Workspace, as described above.

You also may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Workspace. If you wish to be added to our "support-only" contact list at any time, please call us at +1 888 546 5383. [Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#top)

  
**Does IntraLinks use "cookies"?**

We also use cookies to help identify you to the Service and provide you with an additional level of security. After you have accessed the Service and supplied your user ID and password, a temporary cookie is placed on your computer indicating that you have been verified to access the Service. This cookie enables you to enter a Workspace throughout your current working session and will remain on your computer until you log out of that Workspace or you close your web browser. If your browser is set not to accept cookies, you will not be able to sign into and/or use the Service. Again, these cookies are temporary and are not used for tracking your behavior within or outside of the Service. Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not use cookies in conjunction with the Service. [Top](https://web.archive.org/privacy-policy/#top)

  
**How will I be notified of changes to this Privacy Policy?**

We will update this Privacy Policy if we change our policies for collecting and using information provided to us or collected via our website. We will notify you of any material change(s) to this Privacy Policy by posting a notification of such change(s) on the home page of our website and/or our Service logon page.

**How do the Safe Harbor principles apply to information posted by IntraLinks’ clients in a Workspace?**  
We adhere to the applicable Safe Harbor principles in connection with information uploaded to our Service by End Users and maintained in a Workspace. Our Service provides our clients with a central location where they can post information and make it accessible to any party they authorize. We do not undertake to know, and clients have no obligation to inform us, whether the information contained in a Workspace includes personal data. We are not responsible for the content of the information posted in a Workspace nor do we decide who has access to such information. We perform limited processing of information for our clients and accordingly not all of the Safe Harbor principles are applicable to our Service.
