###  What information does Intralinks collect through its public website, and how is this information used?

Intralinks collects certain Personal Information through its website when you choose to submit such information to us through email, an online form, or other method (such as contacting us through our "Contact Us" or "Chat With Sales" website functions). You may provide Intralinks with information in order to request additional information about the Service, employment opportunities, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. We also collect information about website users through  “cookies”. Cookies are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser which allows the server to uniquely identify the browser on each page. For further information about Cookies, please see our "Cookies" section below. By providing us with your information, using the website or any of these communication tools, you consent to Intralinks' use of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

Intralinks also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to this website, including but not limited to a visitor's IP address (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access the website, the type of web browsers used to access the website, and the pages viewed. Such information may be treated as Personal Information about the visitor in accordance with applicable local law. 

We may use information collected through our website to respond to specific requests for information about our Service and other inquiries. We may also use your information to inform you about other Intralinks’ services that might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our Service. If you or your employer decide to purchase our Service, we may use your information for purposes of providing the Service to you. We may provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Intralinks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your Personal Information to help Intralinks provide the Service.  They may also assist Intralinks in communicating with you about the Service and offers from Intralinks and our marketing partners, where you have given us the appropriate permissions as required by applicable law. We may also share your Personal Information with our affiliates in order to provide or improve the Service. 

###  What information does Intralinks collect about users of its permission-based Service and how is this information used?

This section applies to users of the Intralinks Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. The Service is an Internet-based hosted platform designed to enable business communities to share information through a central “hub”. In this Privacy Policy, an “Exchange” or a “Workspace” mean a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information. The manager of an Exchange, the owner of a Workspace or your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges or Workspaces. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange or Workspace will provide certain information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. Using this information, we will provide you with a user ID (an email address) and account activation email to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below. 

When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your “profile”, which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the contact information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. By providing, updating, or accepting your contact information in your profile, you consent to our use of such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to consent to our use of your business contact information, you will not be allowed to use the Service and should not agree to this Privacy Policy and the user agreement presented at the time you first log on. 

Once your contact information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange or Workspace you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) or Workspace(s) may then have access to your contact information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges or Workspaces on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile. 

Your contact information is also added to Intralinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service. If you are selected to join another Exchange or Workspace in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your contact information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange or Workspace. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more “business groups,” which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges or Workspaces  that they have managed. Your contact information may be added to one or more of these business groups. 

We may use your contact information to contact you regarding your and/or your company's use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service, including information about others services that we offer that we think might be of interest to you. You may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange or Workspace by selecting the opt-out link which will be contained in any such email that you receive, or by contacting us using the details at **How can I change, update or delete my contact information or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?**

As a function of the Service, Intralinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g., access to Exchanges, Workspaces and documents, including time, date and length of access). Intralinks also may maintain a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as “Usage Log Information”. Such Usage Log Information may be treated as Personal Information about you in accordance with applicable local law 

Data regarding your access to and use of an Exchange or Workspace will be available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces and Service license and owners (licensees) of that Exchange or Workspace, and may be provided to an employer whose systems are used by you to access the Service. Also, for purposes of maintaining and enhancing Service performance and security, Intralinks may use Usage Log Information and make it available to managers of Exchanges, owners of Workspaces and Service license owners of the Exchanges and Workspaces you access. We may share information about your browser and other local computer settings with Exchange managers  and Workspace owners in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also may use this information internally to tailor our communications to you about the Service, and contact you in relation to providing you with support. We also may aggregate Usage Log Information to create or publish statistical analyses and reports about Service usage, it being understood we will not authorize the publication of Personal Information about any user without the prior written consent of such person. 

Subject to applicable law, as the global directory is a business asset of Intralinks, if Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, the global directory (which includes your contact information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks, who agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request that your contact information be removed from the global directory at any time (see below). 

We may also collect contact information for you from publicly-available sources or it may be received from your employer, where that employer is our customer. We may use that information to contact you about other services that we offer that we think might be of interest to you. You may decline to receive mail or email from us by selecting the opt-out link which will be contained in any such email that you receive, or by contacting us using the details at **How can I change, update or delete my contact information or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?**

###  How does Intralinks protect the security of the information I provide?

We consider any information provided by you through our website to be confidential, unless it is publicly available or has already been provided to us without any confidentiality restriction. Intralinks takes appropriate and reasonable precautions and has implemented appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of information provided or generated through its website and Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use information you provide only to serve legitimate business and service needs consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, Intralinks may disclose contact information and other information collected about you (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule, other legal process or where Intralinks is otherwise required to do so in accordance with locally applicable law and where applicable, our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property. 

###  What about the transfer of information to other countries?

Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the website or our products and services (including the Service), you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of the location(s) of your business, including the United States and countries within Latin America and the Asia-Pacific region, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country. 

Where such transfers of your Personal Information are made they will be made in accordance with applicable law.  Where your Personal Information is transferred outside the European Economic Area, this may include transfers on the basis of a European Commission approved contractual clauses, or as is otherwise permitted by applicable law. 

###  How can I change, update, or delete my contact information, or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?

You can change or update your business contact information at any time, regardless of whether you are a current or former user of the Service, by logging into the Service with your user ID and password and accessing your profile. All business contact information except your name, company name, and email address can be changed by you through your profile. If you wish to change your name, company name, or email address as listed in your profile, you must call our Customer Care line for assistance. A full list of Customer Care numbers can be found [here](https://intralinks.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail_clear/a_id/4034). 

You may request that we remove your contact information from our global directory. However, by doing so, you will automatically lose all access rights to the Service. You may have your contact information removed from the Intralinks global directory by calling us at +1 888 546 5383 or emailing us at support@intralinks.com. Please note that your business contact information may be re-added to the global directory in the future if you are asked to participate in another Exchange or Workspace, as described above. 

You also may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange. If you wish to receive “support-only” contact at any time, please call us at +1 888 546 5383 or email us at support@intralinks.com. 

###  What rights do I have about the use of my information?

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have the right to ask us to access, review, correct, update, change or delete the personal information which we have collected about you, or limit how we use it.  If you believe any information we hold about you is incorrect, or if you want to access the information we hold about you please contact us as described below (see "How can I contact Intralinks with questions about this Privacy Policy?").

##  Does Intralinks participate in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework? 

Intralinks, Inc. ( **Intralinks** ) is a participant in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework, operated by the U.S. Department of Commerce (the **Privacy Shield** ). Our certification can be found **here**. 

A full list of companies who have self-certified with the Privacy Shield is available at <https://www.privacyshield.gov/list>. 

**Intralinks' commitment to the Privacy Shield Principles  **

Intralinks commits to comply with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework Principles (the **Principles** ) in respect of all personal data that we receive from the European Economic Area ( **EEA** ) in accordance with this Privacy Shield Notice. This notice explains how Intralinks complies with the Principles. 

The commitments contained in this notice only apply to personal data received by Intralinks from the EEA. Individuals whose personal data is received by Intralinks from other jurisdictions do not have the rights set out in this notice. 

**Types of personal data collected and purposes for collection and use  **

Intralinks processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA for two purposes: (1) firstly it processes certain personal data on its own behalf for its internal business purposes; and (2) it also processes certain personal data it receives from the EEA on behalf of its customers. In processing each of these categories of personal data, it acts as a data controller (in relation to the first purpose) and a data processor (in relation to the second purpose) respectively. This Privacy Shield Notice explains how Intralinks processes personal data in each of these circumstances. 

_Intralinks as a data controller  _

Details on the types of personal data that we receive from the EEA as a data controller, and the purposes for which we collect and use such data, are set out in our Privacy & Cookies Policy. This policy is presented to each of our end users as part of the end user registration process for our products and services. 

_Intralinks as a data processor_

The nature of Intralinks’ permission-based online services (that is, the Intralinks® platform, Intralinks® Exchanges or Intralinks® Workspaces (together, the **Services** )) provided to Intralinks' customers means that we will process information that end users have uploaded, stored or shared using the Services, the content of which is not known to Intralinks. While much of this information will be financial, corporate or institutional in nature, it will at times include personal data which Intralinks processes following its customers' instructions. 

As a data processor, Intralinks will also process personal data relating to those end users who have been permitted by Intralinks' customers to access Intralinks Services. Such data will be used to provide and operate the Services, and to provide analytics and reporting information to Intralinks' customers. 

Intralinks does not control or own such data and handles such data as a data processor only. It processes such data as governed by the written agreements in place with its customers and to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law. 

**Types of third parties to whom we disclose personal data and the purposes for such disclosure  **

_Intralinks as a data controller  _

As a data controller, Intralinks may further disclose personal data which has been transferred from the EEA to the third parties who are set out in our Privacy & Cookies Policy. 

_Intralinks as a data processor  _

As a data processor, Intralinks may further disclose personal data which has been received from the EEA as instructed by the data controller. We may also disclose personal data to our third party service providers who work on behalf of or with Intralinks under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use personal data to help Intralinks provide the Services for our customers. 

If Intralinks were sold to or merged with another company, personal data processed as part of the Services may be transferred to a prospective successor or successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of Intralinks. 

_Disclosures in response to lawful requests by public authorities_

Intralinks may also disclose personal data (1) in response to lawful requests by public authorities (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements) and, where applicable, in accordance with our internal policy on access by government or regulatory authorities and (2) in our sole discretion if we believe that such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government or regulatory investigation or in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property. 

**Choice  **

If you do not wish Intralinks to pass your personal data that is processed as a Data Controller to a third party who subsequently uses your data for its own purposes (such as one of our marketing partners), you can contact us via the details set out in **Contact us** below. 

**Intralinks' liability for third parties  **

If a third party providing services on Intralinks' behalf processes personal data from the EEA in a manner inconsistent with the Principles, Intralinks will be liable, unless we can prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage. 

**Data integrity and purpose limitation  **

When Intralinks is acting as a data processor, Intralinks will process personal data in compliance with the instructions of its customers, who act as data controllers in respect of such data and will be responsible for ensuring that the personal data is appropriate and only processed for limited purposes. In addition, when its provision of services to a customer ceases, Intralinks will, as agreed with the customer, comply with Intralinks' policy for the secure deletion of personal data processed on behalf of that customer. 

**Access  **

You have certain rights under the Principles to access personal data about you that Intralinks processes as a data controller. To access such personal information contact us by email at [privacy@intralinks.com](mailto:privacy@intralinks.com). We will respond to your request in accordance with the Principles. 

Where Intralinks is acting as a data processor, we will pass each request that we receive from an individual to access, correct, amend or delete personal data relating to them ( **Request** ) to the relevant data controller and will not respond to the Request itself. Intralinks, to the extent instructed by a data controller and in accordance with its customer agreements and applicable law, will assist a customer in complying with Requests by providing relevant information and support to the relevant customer to enable it to comply with the Request. 

**FTC's investigatory and enforcement powers  **

Intralinks' commitments under the Privacy Shield, and compliance with the Principles, are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. 

**Complaints  **

If you have any complaint regarding Intralinks' compliance with the Principles please contact us by email at [privacy@intralinks.com](mailto:privacy@intralinks.com). We will respond to your complaint within 45 calendar days of receipt of your email. 

Where your complaint relates to personal data that we process on behalf of our one of our customers, we may pass your complaint to the relevant customer and will tell you we have done so. 

**Independent dispute resolution body  **

If you feel that Intralinks has not satisfactorily resolved your complaint or has failed to respond to your complaint within 45 days, you may bring your complaint to the attention of your local data protection authority within the EEA ( **DPA** ). The DPAs will establish a panel to act as an independent dispute resolution body who will investigate and resolve complaints brought under the Privacy Shield free of charge to you. Intralinks commits to cooperate with this panel as an independent body to resolve disputes relating to its compliance with the Principles. Intralinks will comply with any advice given by DPAs where they take the view that specific action is necessary to comply with the Principles and will provide the DPAs with written confirmation that such action has been taken. 

You can find the details of your local DPA here. 

**Arbitration  **

**Contact us  **

If you have a question about our adherence to the Principles or our participation in the Privacy Shield please contact us by email at [privacy@intralinks.com](mailto:privacy@intralinks.com).
