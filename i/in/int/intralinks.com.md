## What information does IntraLinks collect through its public website, and how is this information used?

IntraLinks collects certain personally identifiable information through its website when you choose to submit such information to us through email, an online form, or other method. You may provide IntraLinks with information in order to request additional information about the Service, employment opportunities, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. We also collect information about website users through temporary “Cookies” (for further information about Cookies, please see below) used to facilitate completion of online forms and other communications through the website. By providing this information, using the website or any of these communication tools, you consent to IntraLinks' use of your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy.

IntraLinks also maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to this website, including but not limited to a visitor's IP address (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access the website, the type of web browsers used to access the website, and the pages viewed.

We may use information collected through our website to respond to specific requests for information about our services and other inquiries. We may also use your information to inform you about other IntraLinks’ services that might be of interest to you and to gather feedback from you on our website and our services. If you decide to purchase our services, we may use your information for purposes of providing such services to you. Top

## What information does IntraLinks collect about users of its permissioned-based Service and how is this information used?

This section applies to users of the IntraLinks Service. If you only use our public website, this section does not apply to you. The Service is an Internet-based hosted platform designed to enable business communities to share information through a central “hub”. In this Privacy Policy, an “Exchange” means a portion of the Service configured to permit authorized users to access and share information relating to a specific business transaction or project. The manager of an Exchange, or your employer or an affiliate or partner of your employer, who is using the Service, may add you as a participant in one or more Exchanges. The person adding you for the first time to an Exchange will provide certain information about you, such as your name, company name, work email address and work telephone number. Using this information, we will provide you with a user ID and temporary password to access the Service and create a user “profile” for use as described below.

When you first sign onto the Service, you will be presented with your “profile”, which contains the information supplied to us. You will be able to update or correct any of the business contact information in your profile. As the Service is intended for business purposes only, unless your place of work is also your home, you should only enter business contact information. By providing, updating, or accepting your business contact information in your profile, you consent to our use of such information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish to consent to our use of your business contact information, you will not be allowed to use the Service and should not agree to this Privacy Policy and the user agreement presented at the time you first log on.

Once your business contact information has been entered into your profile, this information is added to the participant list for each Exchange you have been authorized to access. Other participants of your Exchange(s) may then have access to your business contact information. You may receive certain emails relating to your use of the Service, such as email alerts related to Exchanges on which you are a participant and other email communications relating to the Service. Emails will be sent to the email address(es) listed in your profile.

Your business contact information is also added to IntraLinks' global directory of current and former users of the Service. If you are selected to join another Exchange in the future, your user ID will be authorized to access that Exchange, and your business contact information will be added to the participant list for that Exchange. Our clients also have the ability to maintain one or more “business groups,” which are contact lists comprised of all users that have used the Exchanges that they have managed. Your business contact information may be added to one or more of these business groups.

We may use your business contact information to contact you regarding your and/or your company's use of the Service, for customer support purposes, and to inform you of updates, modifications and other matters relating to the Service. You may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange.

As a function of the Service, IntraLinks also will maintain a history of your access to the Service, and certain actions taken by you while accessing the Service (e.g., access to publications and comments, searches). IntraLinks also may maintain a log of users' IP addresses, the websites from which users access the Service, the type of web browsers used to access the Service and the browser's settings that may affect Service performance. The information described in this paragraph is referred to as “Usage Log Information”.

Data regarding your access to and use of an Exchange will be available to managers and owners (licensees) of that Exchange, and may be provided to an employer whose systems are used by you to access the Service. Also, for purposes of maintaining and enhancing Service performance and security, IntraLinks may use Usage Log Information and make it available to managers and owners of the Exchanges you access. We may share information about your browser and other local computer settings with Exchange managers in order to troubleshoot or avoid potential access problems. We also may use this information internally to tailor our communications to you about the Service, subject to your right to join our “support-only” contact list (see below). We also may aggregate Usage Log Information to create or publish statistical analyses and reports about Service usage, it being understood we will not authorize the publication of personally identifiable information about any user without the prior written consent of such person.

In addition, as the global directory is a business asset of IntraLinks, if IntraLinks were sold to or merged with another company, the global directory (which includes your business contact information) may be transferred to a successor of the company, or to a subsidiary or affiliate of IntraLinks, who agrees to abide by the terms of this Privacy Policy. You have the right to request that your business contact information be removed from the global directory at any time (see below). Top

## How does IntraLinks protect the security of the information I provide?

We consider any information provided by you through our website to be confidential, unless it is publicly available or has already been provided to us without any confidentiality restriction. IntraLinks takes appropriate and reasonable precautions and has implemented appropriate administrative and technical procedures to protect the security of information provided through its website and Service. We permit persons working for us to access and use information you provide only to serve legitimate business and service needs consistent with this Privacy Policy.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this Privacy Policy, IntraLinks may disclose business contact information and other information collected about you (1) in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, exchange rule or other legal process; and (2) in its sole discretion if it believes such disclosure is appropriate in connection with an official government investigation, or under exigent circumstances in response to a perceived significant threat to a person's health or property.

## How can I change, update, or delete my business contact and other profile information, or request that I not be contacted for non-support purposes?

You can change or update your business contact information at any time, regardless of whether you are a current or former user of the Service, by logging into the Service with your user ID and password and accessing your profile. All business contact information except your name, company name, and email address can be changed by you through your profile. If you wish to change your name, company name, or email address as listed in your profile, you must call our Customer Care line for assistance.

You may request that we remove your business contact information from our global directory. However, by doing so, you will automatically lose all access rights to the Service. You may have your business contact information removed from the IntraLinks global directory by calling us at +1 888 546 5383. Please note that your business contact information may be re-added to the global directory in the future if you are asked to participate in another Exchange, as described above.

You also may decline to receive mail or email from us that does not relate directly to your access to or use of the Service or a particular Exchange. If you wish to be added to our “support-only” contact list at any time, please call us at +1 888 546 5383. Top

## Does IntraLinks use "cookies"?

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard drive. Cookies can be used to remember certain information about you in order to customize the information you see during visits to a website and/or to collect information about your visit.

If you choose to contact us using an online form or otherwise submit information to us through our website, your web browser will create a temporary Cookie. This temporary Cookie records your email address and makes it faster and easier to submit forms to us. Once you have finished using the form or submitting your information, the Cookie is automatically deleted. We do not collect any information stored in this temporary Cookie. If your browser is set not to accept Cookies, your form information may not be received by IntraLinks.

We also use Cookies to help identify you to the Service and provide you with an additional level of security. After you have accessed the Service and supplied your user ID and password, a temporary Cookie is placed on your computer indicating that you have been verified to access the Service. This Cookie enables you to enter an Exchange throughout your current working session and will remain on your computer until you log out of that Exchange or you close your web browser. If your browser is set not to accept Cookies, you will not be able to sign into and/or use the Service. Again, these Cookies are temporary and are not used for tracking your behavior within or outside of the Service. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not use Cookies in conjunction with the Service.

Also, third party companies under agreement with us may deploy cookies or similar technologies to collect and assemble non-personal and technical information from our users (collectively, “Audience Cookies”). Such Audience Cookies, which do not identify you personally, may be placed when you access our websites or others under contract with these third parties. We and these third parties may use such non-personally identifiable information in combination with your visits in order to present advertisements about IntraLinks services likely to be of interest to you. The use of cookies by third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.

We will update this Privacy Policy if we change our policies for collecting and using information provided to us or collected via our website. We will notify you of any material change(s) to this Privacy Policy by posting a notification of such change(s) on the home page of our website and/or our Service logon page. We will not post notification of non-material changes, such as correction of typographical errors. Top

## Does IntraLinks participate in the Safe Harbor European Union Privacy Framework?

We have committed to handling data coming from the European Union (EU) into the United States in accordance with the Safe Harbor Principles and are registered with the U.S. Department of Commerce as a member of the Safe Harbor network.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Policy, please contact us at the above email address.

If a complaint that cannot be resolved through our internal processes, we agree to participate in the dispute resolution procedures of the panel established by the European Data Protection Authorities to resolve disputes pursuant to the Safe Harbor Principles. Top

## How do the Safe Harbor principles apply to information posted by IntraLinks’ clients in a Workspace?

We adhere to the applicable Safe Harbor principles in connection with information uploaded to our Service by IntraLinks clients and maintained in an Exchange. Our Service provides IntraLinks clients with a central location where they can post information and make it accessible to any party they authorize. We do not undertake to know, and IntraLinks clients have no obligation to inform us, whether the information contained in an Exchange includes personal data. We are not responsible for the content of the information posted in an Exchange nor do we decide who has access to such information. We perform limited processing of information for IntraLinks clients and accordingly not all of the Safe Harbor principles are applicable to our Service.
