 **What information does IntraLinks collect from visitors to its website?**  
IntraLinks collects certain personally identifiable information through its website (1) when you choose to submit such information to us through e-mail, an online form, or other method, or (2) through a temporary cookie for the sole purpose of using one of our online forms or submitting information to us as described below. You may choose to provide IntraLinks with information in order to request additional information about IntraLinks's services, for press inquiries, or for other purposes. By providing IntraLinks with information, you consent to IntraLinks's use of this information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, IntraLinks does not collect any information about you though our website without your knowledge and consent. 

Like all web servers, IntraLinks maintains a log of certain information concerning visitors to our site, such as visitors' IP addresses (a computer's numerical Internet address), the websites from which visitors access intralinks.com, the type of web browsers used to access the site, and the pages viewed. However, all such logged information is in "aggregate" form, and IntraLinks does not associate this information with a specific visitor's name, computer or other personally identifiable information (in other words, you remain anonymous). 

IntraLinks also offers visitors the ability to search our site by entering certain keywords into our search engine. We do not keep any information regarding searches performed through the IntraLinks search engine. Top
