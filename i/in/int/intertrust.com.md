# Privacy Policy – Intertrust Technologies

Effective as of December 9, 2016 

Intertrust Technologies Corporation and its affiliated companies (“Intertrust”) provides this Privacy Policy in order to describe our practices regarding the information we collect through www.intertrust.com (the “Site”). By using and visiting the Site, you agree to the information collection and use practices described in this Privacy Policy.  This Privacy Policy applies only to the Site. Your use of the Site is also governed by our [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms-conditions).

THE SITE IS INTENDED FOR USERS AGE THIRTEEN (13) AND OLDER. By using the Site, you acknowledge that you are at least 13 years old. Note that the Site is not intended for children and the Site does not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected personal information from anyone younger than the age of 13, we will delete that information.

##  1\. What Information We Collect 

### Information That You Provide

We may collect “ **Personal Information** ” (information that can be used to identify or contact you as a specific individual, such as your name or email address) and other information about you, such as demographic information (your age, gender, ZIP code or similar information), business information (including your job title, employer, and business contact information), and certain information about your interests and preferences. We will also collect payment information (typically, credit card account information) if you choose to purchase products or services through the Site.  Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.

### Community Forums & User Content

The Site may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly in forums, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (“ **Community Forums** “).  You may choose, through such features or otherwise, to submit or post questions, comments, suggestions or other content, (collectively, “ **User** **Content** “).  Please note that certain information, such as your name, may be publicly displayed on the Site along with your User Content.

**Note that anything you post to a Community Forum** **is public** _—_ **others will have access to your User Content and may use it or share it with third parties. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.**

### Information Third Parties Provide About You

We may receive information about you from third parties. For example, we may supplement the information we collect with outside records in order to provide you with information, services or products you have requested, to tailor content, to offer you opportunities to purchase products or services that we believe may be of interest to you, and for other purposes. We may combine the information we receive from those other sources with information we collect through the Site. In those cases, we will apply this Privacy Policy to the combined information.

Information We Collect Automatically When You Access and Use the Site 

As described below, we and our third-party service providers automatically or passively collect certain information regarding your use of our Site (“ **Usage Information** ”).

Usage Information also includes the IP address or other unique identifier (“ **Device Identifier** ”) for any computer, mobile phone, or other device used to access our Site.

Some mobile service providers may also provide us with information regarding the physical location of the device you used to access our Website. Usage Information is generally non-identifying, but if we associate it with you as a specific and identifiable person, we will treat it as Personal Information.

For example, if you view or click on an advertisement for Intertrust or one of our products, our service provider(s) may be able to tell us the advertisement that you clicked on and where you were viewing the advertisement. Our service providers may set and access their own tracking technologies on your device (including cookies and web beacons) and may otherwise collect or have access to information about you and your visits to and activity on the Site, as well as on other websites or online services. Some of these third parties may collect personal information from you over time when you visit the Site or other websites and services.  Cookies and web beacons, including those set by third-party network advertisers, may be used to, among other things, target advertisements to you, prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times, and conduct research regarding the usefulness of certain advertisements to you.

We use a variety of service providers to perform advertising services. Some of these companies are members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“ **NAI** ”) or the Digital Advertising Alliance (“ **DAA** ”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. You may want to visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and the “opt-out” procedures of NAI members. You may also want to visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices/, which provides information regarding targeted advertising and offers an “opt-out” by participating companies in the DAA Self-Regulatory Program. Please note opting out through these mechanisms does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads while online. 

## 5\. Security

Intertrust takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect and secure the information it collects and stores about its users. However, please remember that no data storage or data transmission is guaranteed to be 100% secure. Thus, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, Intertrust cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You use our Site and provide us with your information at your own risk.  We may store information that we collect through our Site indefinitely except as otherwise required by law.

The Site may contain links to third-party websites, such as our pages available through third party social media platforms. Intertrust takes no responsibility for the content, operation or privacy practices of such websites. This Privacy Policy does not apply to third-party websites, and you should check the policies of any linked website before offering information to the sponsor of the website. Intertrust provides these links to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link to such websites does not imply endorsement by Intertrust of those sites.

By visiting the Site, or providing us with any information, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to this transfer, processing and storage of your information in the United States, a jurisdiction in which the privacy laws may not be as comprehensive as those in the country where you reside and/or are a citizen.

## 11\. California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, residents of the State of California have the right to request from companies conducting business in California certain information relating to third parties to which the company has disclosed certain categories of personal information during the preceding year for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Alternatively, the law provides that a company may comply, as Intertrust does, by disclosing in its privacy policy that it provides consumers choice (opt-out or opt-in) regarding sharing personal information with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes, and information on how to exercise that choice.  As stated above in this Privacy Policy, Intertrust provides you choice prior to sharing your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. If you do not opt-in or if you choose to opt-out at the time Intertrust offers that choice, Intertrust does not share your information with that identified third party for its direct marketing purposes.

If you are a California resident and you have questions about our practices with respect to sharing information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes and your ability to exercise choice, please email your request to [legal@intertrust.com](mailto:legal@intertrust.com) or write to: Intertrust Technologies Corporation, Attn: Legal Department, 920 Stewart Drive, Suite 100, Sunnyvale, CA 94085.  You must put the statement “Your California Privacy Rights” in the subject field of your email or include it in your writing if you choose to write to us at the designated mailing address. You must include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent properly, or do not have complete information.  Please note that we are only required to respond to one (1) such request each calendar year.
