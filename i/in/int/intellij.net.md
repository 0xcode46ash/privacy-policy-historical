# JetBrains :: Technology-leading software development firm specializing in the creation of intelligent development tools.

JetBrains strongly believes that the protection of individualsâ€™ privacy is a critical issue when doing business via the Internet. We have created this policy to inform our site visitors and customers of the measures we employ to keep private and confidential the information they may choose to share with us.

JetBrains does collect some kinds of information from visitors to this Web site. By using this site, you agree to allow us to collect the kinds of information information described later on this page, and to use it in the ways described.

Should we ever need to change this policy, we will post the changes on this page and send an e-mail notification to customers and others who may have shared their e-mail addresses with us. We will also post a notification on our [RSS feed](http://jetbrains.com/rss.xml) with a link to this file.

#### Handing of Personally Identifiable Information

On JetBrains Web sites, we store personal information about you ONLY after you have given us permission to do so. You may choose to provide information to us if, for example, you register for a trial license, purchase a product, or subscribe to a newsletter.

JetBrains may use the information collected via this Web site anywhere in our international organization in order to process your inquiries and orders and/or to help improve our products. For example, information collected by our European headquarters may be shared with one of our offices in the United States and vice versa.

Employees of JetBrains s.r.o. or approved contractors or resellers (collectively referred to as "JetBrains") have access to personally identifiable customer information. All employees, contractors, and resellers are legally bound to uphold this policy and observe your right to privacy and confidentiality. We will never share your information with third parties outside "JetBrains" unless you give express permission for us to do so, or unless we are required to do so under applicable law.

#### Privacy Across the Company

As an international company, JetBrains s.r.o. maintains databases in several countries. Any information that you submit to us via this Web site may be sent electronically to a database maintained in a different country. We protect your privacy around the world by ensuring that this Website and all JetBrains networks adhere to data-protection principles described in this page.

#### Third-party Order Procesing

Orders for JetBrains products are securely processed by Element 5. Their privacy policy is published on the Web at <http://www.element5.com/privacy.html>. Element 5 employs state-of-the art security arrangements and facilities to prevent security abuse. You can read more about this on the Web at <http://www.element5.com/security.html>.

#### Online Information Collection

  


#### IP Addresses

JetBtains uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our Website, and to gather usage information. When you visit our site, we recognize only your domain name and not your e-mail address. The only way we will ever obtain your e-mail address is if you give it to us by filling out an on-line form or by sending us an e-mail message.

#### Cookies

We use "cookies" on some (but not all) pages to deliver personalized content or to tailor our information offerings or responses according to the way you use the site, and/or your current context on the site. We do not use cookies to gather or transmit any personally identifiable information about you.

#### Registration, Subscription, and Support Forms

Our site includes electronic forms that you may choose to fill out to request information or support, or to register to obtain trial licenses for JetBrains products, or to participate in product Early Access Programs, or to subscribe to our Announcements newsletter. If you choose to send us information via these forms, this enables us to send you requested information, product licenses, product information, news, or notice of special promotions, or to respond to your support questions.

#### Data Protection

JetBrains takes precautions to ensure the safety and confidentiality of the information we collect via our Website. We employ the latest data security technologies including firewalls, encryption, password protection, intrusion monitoring, and other techniques to keep your information as safe as modern networking technology can make it.

#### Use of E-mail Addresses

If you choose to give us your e-mail address, we will communicate with you via e-mail. We will not share your e-mail address with others outside JetBrains and its approved contractors and resellers. You can choose not to receive any more e-mail at any time.

Depending on which e-mail program you use and how it is configured, information about you may be sent automatically when you send us e-mail. JetBrains has no control over this and recommends that you consult your system administrator if you have concerns about what information is being sent by your e-mail program.

#### Online Surveys

We may occasionally conduct online surveys that may ask you for demographic information (your location, position, tool use, etc.) If the online survey collects contact data such as your e-mail address (although generally they do not), we will use that data to send you further information only if the form specifically asks for your permission and you give it. You are free to revoke any such permission at any time.

#### Links to Other Sites

The JetBrains Web site contains links to other sites. JetBrains is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these linked Web sites.

#### Choice/Opt-Out

You can opt out of receiving e-mail communications from JetBrains at any time. You only need to e-mail us to have your name and details removed from our e-mail list or registration database. Please allow 7 business days for the removal to be processed.

#### Inquiries and Feedback

If you have any questions about this privacy statement, or if you wish to inspect or update the information we hold about you, please feel free to contact us at: [sales@jetbrains.com](mailto:sales@jetbrains.com)
