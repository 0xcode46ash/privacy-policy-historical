### Types of Personal Information

Personal Identifiable Information (PII)  or Personal Data is information that can be used on its own or in combination with other information, to identify, contact or locate a single person, or to identify an individual or natural person in context. Personal information does not include anonymised or statistical data that by itself does not allow identification of you as an individual.Sensitive Information or Special Category Personal Data we may collect includes information about an individual’s current health or health history, sexual orientation or religion. 

###   
How we collect and use Your Personal Information

In order to provide our services, we will usually need to collect some personal information about the individuals we are assisting. 

We collect information about you when you buy, use or benefit from International SOS' services or products. 

We may not always receive personal information from you directly but also from other sources, such as your employer or your relatives, your insurance company, other assistance companies, financial institutions, medical service providers or travel agencies. 

### Digital Travel Risk Management Services

If you use our travel assistance app, it will collect some Personal Information and Travel Information. This may include the email address of the app enabled device and your organisation or your personal International SOS membership number, depending on whether you have access to this service by virtue of your employment or whether you are an individual subscriber. The app also periodically collects usage data. 

  
While the app can also be used without providing your email address, this information is integral to how the app works, as we need to know where you are in order to keep you safe. The app will provide local emergency contact details, tailored medical and security alerts for your location as well as monitoring your location so we can assist you during situations where you may be in danger. Location monitoring is a voluntary feature and you can enable and disable it at any time.

  
We have engaged a number of third parties to support us with the data processing required to deliver our services:

**Location of Processing** | **Services  **  
---|---  
 USA (1) | Server Hosting, Data Aggregation/Transformation   
 France (2) | Server Hosting  
 India | Maintenance, Administration, Development & Support  
 USA | Administration & Support  
 USA | Administration & Support  
 (1) European clients usually store data on our French server, in which case there is no hosting in the US

If you require more detailed information, please review the Privacy Notice within the app itself or contact [dpo@internationalsos.com](mailto:dpo@internationalsos.com). 

### Medical and Security Assistance including Travel Services

When you speak with someone at one of our Assistance Centres, the call will usually be recorded. We do this for Training and Quality purposes. If you do not wish to be recorded, please let us know and we will call you back on an unrecorded line.

In order to assist you, we will usually need to ask you for some personal information, such as your name, contact details and the company you work for, and this will be recorded on our case management system. Such information is required to identify you and respond to you and where required keep a record of our interaction. We will only collect as much Personal Information as is required to provide the service you ask for in a safe and efficient manner. Some of this may be sensitive data such as medical information required to refer you to a suitable healthcare provider.

If our coordinators ask you for permission to share your personal information and medical information with your insurer, this will be to allow them to place a Guarantee of Payment so you will not be asked to pay for your medical expenses. Your consent will allow us to submit a claim to your insurer.

If our coordinators ask you for permission to share personal or medical information with your employer, this is because your employer has asked us to update them each time we provide assistance so that they can fulfil their Duty of Care and offer support where needed. They may also require us to obtain approval from them before paying for your medical expenses. You can withhold your consent for us to share either your personal information, medical information or both. Where your employer requires us to obtain their approval before making financial arrangements on your behalf, we may not be able to assist you with this if we do not have your consent to contact them.

If our coordinators ask you for permission to share your medical information with a third party provider, this will be to allow them to make arrangements on your behalf for which this information is required by the provider (such as hospital admission).

Data collected for the purpose of providing medical and security assistance services is kept 2 years and then 1 year in archive.  Please refer to our Data Retention, Archiving and Destruction Policy under https://www.internationalsos.com/privacy.

### International SOS Website

**Cookies and Tracking Technology**

International SOS Assistance and its partners use cookies or similar technologies to analyse trends, run the website, track our users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. You can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level, but if you choose to disable cookies, it may limit your use of certain features or functions on our website or service.

Some of our service providers (e.g. International SOS's service providers monitoring our satisfaction survey) use cookies on the International SOS site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by the International SOS site only and does not cover the use of cookies by anyone else.

**Acceptance and links to other websites**

This website may contain links to other websites, which are there for your convenience and not as an indication of International SOS’s approval. These other websites may have their own policies, which we do not control, and therefore are not covered by this statement or the International SOS Data Protection Policy. 

**Data protection for minors**

We do not knowingly collect any information on anyone who has not reached the age of 18 years through the online services and the International SOS website.

**CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television)**

Closed-Circuit Television, also known as video surveillance, is the use of video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific place, on a limited set of monitors. International SOS uses CCTV solely to deter or detect unlawful behaviour in and around International SOS property and to support the conduct of investigations. 

At locations where International SOS operates CCTV, a privacy notice is displayed.  CCTV recorders are located in areas with restricted access and operated by specifically trained staff only. Tapes are retained no longer than 90 days.  Local legislative requirements are adhered to.

### How long we keep Your Personal Information

We only retain your personal information as long as it is required and we have a lawful reason. When your personal information is no longer required it will be securely destroyed or transferred in accordance with prior contractual agreement or your own preference. Our data retention policy is published at <https://www.internationalsos.com/privacy>. 

### Sharing your Personal Information

We do not sell your personal information in any circumstances and our business model does not rely on such action. 

Your personal information may be transferred to other companies within the International SOS Group, or to third parties that help us deliver our services to you. These companies may be located in another country. If we need to transfer personal data outside of the EU/EEA, and the recipient country does not have adequacy status, we ensure that the organisation we are transferring the data to is either Privacy Shield certified (if US based) or we have applied the required safeguards such as EC Standard Contractual Clauses. When transferring personal data outside of the EU/EEA to another International SOS entity, we assure that it remains protected. All International SOS entities acting as Data Controller have signed up to our Binding Corporate Rules (approved by the French Data Protection Authority, CNIL) and where they act as Data Processors, the data transfer is safeguarded by inter-company EC Standard Contractual Clauses.

Whenever we need to transfer sensitive personal information (such as medical information), we will first ask for your consent. 

We do not share your personal information with third parties unless one of the following conditions or reasons applies:

**We have legitimate interest to do so**  
To be able to provide our services we may share some personal information with third parties in a way that you would expect, such as providing your name to the medical practice where you have asked us to arrange an appointment for you. We also provide personal information to other companies within the International SOS Group or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us based on our instructions and in compliance with Data Protection Legislation, our Data Protection Policy and additional confidentiality and security measures.  If you require a list of our third party data processors, please contact [dpo@internationalsos.com.](mailto:dpo@internationalsos.com) 

Or

**You have provided explicit consent**  
We will ask for your explicit consent before sharing any sensitive personal information about you. We will provide you with clear explanations to allow you to make an informed choice. You are entitled to withdraw your consent at any time. 

Or

**There is a legal obligation**  
We may transfer your personal information to Government authorities, agencies and institutions, but ONLY as required or allowed by applicable regulations.

Or

**We need to verify your insurance or employment benefits**  
In some cases we may need to notify third parties such as your insurer or employer, for example to verify your benefits before paying for your medical expenses, and share some of your personal information with them. We will always ask for your consent if sensitive data needs to be shared or if we need to share information for additional purposes that you may not expect.
