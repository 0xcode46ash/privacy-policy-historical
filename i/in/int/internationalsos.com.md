We also describe what information we collect about you and why we collect it, how we use and safeguard that information and we explain what choices you have, including how to access and update or ask us to delete your information.

Our Promise to You:

  * When we need your Personal Information we always explain the purpose and will not use your information for any other purpose without asking you first.

  * We only share information with third parties for purposes specified in this Privacy Notice, for reasons required by law or with your explicit prior consent.
  * We carefully select our partners and third-party service providers and implement contractual clauses that hold them accountable to the same data protection and privacy standards we meet ourselves.

  * We understand that technology develops rapidly and continuously monitor and enhance the measures we have implemented to protect your information from unauthorized access and accidental loss or disclosure. 



### Types of Personal Information

Personal Identifiable Information (PII)  or Personal Data is information that can be used on its own or in combination with other information, to identify, contact or locate a single person, or to identify an individual or natural person in context. Personal information does not include anonymised or statistical data that by itself does not allow identification of you as an individual.Sensitive Information or Special Category Personal Data we may collect includes information about an individual’s current health or health history, sexual orientation or religion. 

### How we collect and use Your Personal Information

In order to provide our services, we will usually need to collect some personal information about the individuals we are assisting.   
We collect information about you when you buy, use or benefit from International SOS' services or products.   
We may not always receive personal information from you directly but also from other sources, such as your employer or your relatives, your insurance company, other assistance companies, financial institutions, medical service providers or travel agencies. 

### Travel Security (TravelTracker)

If you use our TravelTracker app, it will collect some Personal information and Travel information. This includes the email address of the app enabled device and your organisation or your personal International SOS membership number. The app also periodically collects usage data.   
This information is integral to how the app works, as we need to know where you are in order to keep you safe. The app will provide local emergency contact details, tailored medical and security alerts for your location as well as monitoring your location so we can assist you during situations where you may be in danger. Location monitoring is a voluntary feature and you can disable it at any time.

### Medical and Security Assistance

When you speak with someone at one of our Assistance Centres, the call will usually be recorded. We do this for Training and Quality purposes. If you do not wish to be recorded, please let us know and we will call you back on an unrecorded line.

In order to assist you, we will usually need to ask you for some personal information, such as your name, contact details and the company you work for, and this will be recorded on our case management system. Such information is required to identify you and respond to you and where required keep a record of our interaction. We will only collect as much Personal Information as is required to provide the service you ask for in a safe and efficient manner. Some of this may be sensitive data such as medical information required to refer you to a suitable healthcare provider.

If our coordinators ask you for permission to share your personal information and medical information with your insurer, this will be to allow them to place a Guarantee of Payment so you will not be asked to pay for your medical expenses. Your consent will allow us to submit a claim to your insurer.

If our coordinators ask you for permission to share personal or medical information with your employer, this is because your employer has asked us to update them each time we provide assistance so that they can fulfil their Duty of Care and offer support where needed. They may also require us to obtain approval from them before paying for your medical expenses. You can withhold your consent for us to share either your personal information, medical information or both. Where your employer requires us to obtain their approval before making financial arrangements on your behalf, we may not be able to assist you with this if we do not have your consent to contact them.

### Medical Services (Clinics)

If you visit one of our clinics, for example for a consultation, medical treatment or occupational health assessment, personal and sensitive information will be collected as part of your medical record maintained by the clinic which allows our medical staff to provide medical advice and treatment as appropriate. We retain original medical records in compliance with applicable regulation.

### Training and E-Learning

International SOS provides Training services and we will collect some personal information as part of attendance or completion records and to issue certificates to candidates.

### Concierge Services 

We will ask for your Personal information and Credit Card Information (Card Company, Number, Expiry Date) to assist you and process your payment. We handle all payment information in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS). Full details are available in the Aspire Privacy Statement at <https://www.aspirelifestyles.com/en/privacy-policy>.

### Occupational Health Assessment (MedFit)

We will receive your name and email address from your employer. In the course of providing services, we will also maintain relevant health records received from you and the occupational health clinic. At the end of contract, International SOS will return any such health records in accordance with instructions received from your employer.
