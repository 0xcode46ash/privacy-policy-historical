## SAFE HARBOR

This Statement specifically applies to organizations requiring compliance with the European Commission Data Privacy Policy.

What is the Safe Harbor and how is it related to the European data privacy directive?

The European Commission's Directive on Data Protection went into effect in October 1998, prohibiting the transfer of personal data to non-European Union nations that do not meet the European "adequacy" standard for privacy protection. While the United States and the European Union share the goal of enhancing privacy protection for their citizens, the United States and the European Union adopt different approaches to data privacy. In order to bridge these different privacy approaches and provide a streamlined means for U.S. organizations to comply with the Directive, the U.S. Department of Commerce in consultation with the European Commission developed a "Safe Harbor" framework. Complying with the Safe Harbor's set of principles - approved by the EU in July of 2000 - is a way for U.S. companies to certify that they provide "adequate" privacy protection, as defined by the Directive. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, International SOS Online adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles.

International SOS Online processes information from the European Union according to the Safe Harbor Framework and is so registered by the Department of Commerce. To find out more about Safe Harbor you can visit the Department of Commerce's website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/> .
