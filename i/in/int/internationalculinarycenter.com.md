**Third Party Intermediaries**  
We occasionally use outside companies to mail promotional material via email and post. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**IP Address**  
We log all connections to our web servers, and those log files include your IP address. An IP address is NOT personally identifiable information, but general information about your location, connection to the Internet, and your Internet Service Provider. We only use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the site.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about their computer. Usage of a cookie is in NO way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. So, while the user session will be tracked to give us an idea of what parts of the site a user is visiting, the user will remain anonymous. If a user rejects cookies, they may still use our site.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once a user closes the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user’s hard drive for an extended period of time. We may use cookies to: keep count of your return visits to our site, and accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, and statistical information on web site usage

We do not use cookies to identify, monitor, or track any personally identifiable information. Our cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you. We do not merge or associate our cookie information with any personally identifiable information we obtain.

**Log Files**  
Like most standard web site servers, we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links**  
The International Culinary Center web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware of that when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by [www.internationalculinarycenter.com](http://www.internationalculinarycenter.com/), [www.lecolenyc.com](http://www.lecolenyc.com/), and [www.pastryscoop.com](http://www.pastryscoop.com/).

**Security**  
The International Culinary Center takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and protected with industry standard encryption software: Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open, when users are just ‘surfing.’ While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information are also maintained in a secure environment. If users have any questions about the security on our web site, users can send an email to [Tara Hill](mailto:thill@frenchculinary.com).

**Notification of Changes**  
We will notify all users if there are any material changes to our privacy policy. We will take commercially reasonable measures to obtain written or active email consent from the user if [www.internationalculinarycenter.com](http://www.internationalculinarycenter.com/), [www.lecolenyc.com](http://www.lecolenyc.com/), and [www.pastryscoop.com](http://www.pastryscoop.com/) is going to be using the information collected from the user in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection. All changes to our privacy statement will be posted prior to a change.
