# Privacy Policy

Interactive Mathematics does not sell or give away your personal information, ever. Your right to privacy is paramount.

The information that you provide (when leaving a comment or asking a question) stays with Interactive Mathematics. 

## Email Privacy

Your email address is never displayed on Interactive Mathematics or on the associated [squareCircleZ](http://www.squarecirclez.com/blog/) blog. Everyone hates spam!

## Cookies

Sometimes cookies are placed on your computer to improve the functionality of the site. A cookie is a small text file that sits in your browser's cache. For example, Interactive Mathematics conducts a poll from time to time and a cookie is used to remember your voting status. These cookies will **not** store personal information about you and will **not** be used in a malacious way. They do not track where you've been.

The poll cookie is a persistent cookie, which means it will stay on your computer for a certain amount of time, then disappear.

These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
