## Email Privacy

Your email address is never displayed on Interactive Mathematics or on the associated [squareCircleZ](http://www.intmath.com/blog/) blog. Everyone hates spam!

## Cookies

Sometimes cookies are placed on your computer to improve the functionality of the site. A cookie is a small text file that sits in your browser's cache. For example, Interactive Mathematics conducts a poll from time to time and a cookie is used to remember your voting status (voted already, or not voted yet). These cookies will **not** store personal information about you and will **not** be used in a malacious way. They do not track where you've been on other sites.

The poll cookie is a persistent cookie, which means it will stay on your computer for a certain amount of time, then disappear.

There is also a mobile device cookie, which is set when visitors choose how to view the site with their mobile device (either mobile version or full version). 

## Third-party Advertising

These companies may use information ( **not** including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites, including search engines, in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This "behavioral advertisitng" is used by Google Adsense, which is used throughout the sites. 

If you would like more information about this practice and would like to know your options in relation to not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/faq).

## Privacy policies of linked sites

Throughout IntMath and squareCircleZ there are links to other sites, including sponsored links, independent of IntMath. These sites will have their own Privacy Policies and users are encouraged to read those policies before sharing personal information on those sites. 

## Server hosting company's Privacy Policy
