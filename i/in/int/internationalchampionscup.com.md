From time to time we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with the Company to provide additional features on the Site. These special relationships may include Partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as “co-branded pages”). Any information, including Personal Information that you provide on one of these co-branded pages, may be shared such Partners or sponsors. By participating in activities or providing your Personal Information on these co-branded pages (or by accessing these co-branded pages or the Site), you consent to our providing your Personal Information to such Partners or sponsors.

**C. Service Providers**

We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and the Site or administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, fulfilling orders, and administering sweepstakes. We may share your Personal Information with such service providers for such limited purposes. For instance, if you participate in a sweepstakes, game, or loyalty program that results in a prize or award, we will share your Personal Information with our fulfillment and management agencies.

**D. Advertising Networks**

We may have relationships with third party service providers known as advertising networks to place and administer advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. Using cookies and pixel tags (also known as web beacons), advertising networks may collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to deliver advertisements that may be of particular interest to you. This process does not involve the collection of any Personal Information. The advertising networks do not know your name, phone number, address, email address or any Personal Information. Nor do we share any Personal Information with such advertising networks. To find out more about how such advertising networks manage the privacy of Personal Information in conjunction with delivering advertisements online and how to opt-out of information collection by such advertising networks please go to: http://www.youradchoices.com or http://www.networkadvertising.org. We do not operate or control these websites, and are not responsible for the opt-out choices provided therein.

**E. Other Disclosures**

In addition to the third parties described above, Personal Information of any Visitor, or individual whose information is collected otherwise, may also be shared with parties outside of the Company: (i) as permitted by law, (ii) in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or a bankruptcy of the Company, (iii) if we determine that disclosure of specific information is necessary to comply with the request of a law enforcement or regulatory agency or other legal process, or (iv) to protect the interests or safety of the Company or Visitors to the Site.

**Your Choices with Respect to Personal Information**

The Site gives Visitors the opportunity to stop receiving communications from the Company if requested.

**Children**

The Company does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from Visitors or individuals under the age of eighteen (18) (“Minors”), and we will not knowingly link to any third party website that solicits or collects Personal Information from Minors.

**Security and Protection of Personal Information Collected by Us**

The Company’s Site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the Personal Information under our control. The Company has implemented various physical, electronic, and managerial measures, including education and training of our personnel, to provide Personal Information with reasonable protection from accidental loss or destruction, improper use, alteration, or disclosure. The Company has invested and deployed a wide variety of technology and security features to ensure the privacy of Personal Information that is collected by the Company. The Company will continue to revise policies and implement additional security features as new technologies become available. Unfortunately, no system is perfect; therefore, the Company makes no representations or warranties with regard to the sufficiency of these security measures. The Company shall not be responsible for any actual or consequential damages (or any other damages or liability of any kind whatsoever) that result from a lapse in compliance with this Policy because of a security breach or technical malfunction.

**International Transfers of Personal Information**

Permitted transfers of information, including Personal Information, either to third parties or within the Company, include the transfer of information from one jurisdiction to another, such as transfers to and from the United States. Because privacy laws vary from one jurisdiction to another, Personal Information may be transferred to a jurisdiction where the laws provide less or different protection than the jurisdiction in which the Personal Information originated. We will always handle your Personal Information as described in this Policy. The Company abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, which framework is posted at http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/.

**Access to Your Personal Information**

If you wish to obtain a copy of the Personal Information that you provided to the Company, or if you become aware the Personal Information you have provided is incorrect and you would like us to correct or delete it, please contact us at privacy@internationalchampionscup.com. Please note, however, that before the Company is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details, including Personal Information, to help us to respond to your request. The Company affirms that it will correct, amend, or delete any erroneous information if instructed to do so by you, subject to the safe harbor framework set forth by the United States Department of Commerce and the European Union Safe Harbor principles of proportionality, data quality, and reasonableness. We always will endeavor to respond within an appropriate timeframe to any request under this section.

**Enforcement**

The Company will cooperate with the United States Department of Commerce and the European Union Data Protection Authorities to resolve any complaints and disputes arising in connection with this Policy. All necessary Company employees will be required to be familiar with and adhere to this Policy. The Company will investigate any reported complaints of violations of this Policy and will take prompt remedial action where violations are found.

**Amendments**

From time to time, the Company may update, modify or change this Policy. When this occurs, the new Policy will be posted on the Site. You should check the Site periodically to review the most recent Policy. Your use of the Site or provision of Personal Information to the Company or any of our Partners after any update, modification, or change to this Policy constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to such updates, modifications, or changes.
