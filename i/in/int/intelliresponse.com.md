# intelliResponse - Privacy Policy

This site is owned by Intelliresponse Systems Inc.  This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide via this site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this site. 

YOUR CONSENT

By using this site, you agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this site, you consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

ACTIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION

Like many Web sites, this site actively collects information from its visitors by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms.   Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on). 

PASSIVE INFORMATION COLLECTION

As you navigate through a Web site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses and cookies. 

We use **Internet Protocol (IP) addresses** on this site. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user’s computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site.

A " **cookie** " is a bit of information that a Web site sends to your Web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences.

Our site and site metrics use cookies. "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on Web sites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This site uses session cookies. 

USE AND DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION

Except as otherwise stated, we may use your information to improve the content of our site, to customize the site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes, and for the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. 

If you provide personally identifiable information to this site, we may combine such information with other actively collected information unless we specify otherwise at the point of collection. We will take reasonable measures to prevent personally identifiable information from being combined with passively collected information, unless you consent otherwise. 

In addition, we will make full use of all information acquired through this site that is not in personally identifiable form.

ACCESS AND CORRECTION

To keep your personally identifiable information accurate, current, and complete, please contact us. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct personally identifiable information in our possession that you have previously submitted via this site. 

SECURITY

We take reasonable steps to protect your personally identifiable information as you transmit your information from your computer to our site and to protect such information from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever 100% secure or error-free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this site may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES

This site may contain links or references to other Web sites. Please be aware that we do not control other Web sites and that, in any case, this Privacy Policy does not apply to those Web sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every Web site you visit. 

HOW TO CONTACT US

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or the information practices of this site, please contact our Privacy Officer, S.G. McKenna, at [_privacy@intelliresponse.com_](mailto:privacy@intelliresponse.com).

CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

If this Privacy Policy changes, the revised policy will be posted on this site. Please check back periodically, and especially before you provide any personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on January 22, 2003.
