It is also convenient because when you come back to the online store the online store can recognize you and enter in your name and address for you into the order form when you place a new order. 

These files in no way allow us to access your hard drive at anytime; it only allows your system to tell us that you have previously visited our site.

**Intego software sending information via the Internet**  
Some of our software products have been equipped with a version checking feature (NetUpdate). Upon launching the software application, the version of the application, IP address, serial numbers and login/password you are running is captured and sent to our webserver. It is compared to the most current shipping version and if there is an update available the software will notify you of how to obtain it.

**E-mail addresses and their usage**  
Intego asks that you enter your e-mail address on our download pages before downloading software, it is a requirement to download our software. Intego does not sell, trade or rent your email address to others. We ask for your e-mail address so that we may contact you to inform you of updates, special offers, or other software that we think would be of interest to you, including software or products from companies other than Intego. Any offer you may receive via email will always come from Intego, not the sponsoring third party. We know that the members of our e-mail list are very sensitive to receiving spam, or unsolicited email; hence we are very careful about what we send out and to whom.

When you participate in a contest, promotion or survey, we may ask for your name, address, e-mail address or other information.

At any time, you may choose to not be included in e-mail messages from Intego by visiting our mailing list page and unsubscribing your email address.

**Security of Information**  
When you place an order for a product, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all the information you input before it is sent to us.
