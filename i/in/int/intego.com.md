## Intego's Privacy Policy

Intego recognizes your right to privacy and confidentiality and we are committed to protecting your personal information. The following explains how much information we gather when you visit our web site, and how that information is used. By visiting the Intego web site, you are accepting the policy described below.

## Information Received

When you browse our web site, our servers store some information about you, such as the IP (Internet protocol) address you connect from, the web browser you use, and its platform or operating system; all web servers record this information in logs, but this does not give us any other knowledge of you or your browsing activity. We do not gather any other personal information about you when you browse our web site.

## About Cookies

Like many web sites, Intego uses "cookies" to gather and/or store some information about your browsing activity on our site. A cookie is a small bit of data that is sent to your browser by our web server, and it can only be read by the server that issued it. A cookie cannot be executed as code or deliver viruses or other malware, and it cannot be used to discover anything about you, your browsing activity on other sites, or the contents of your computer.

Our website may use cookies to track visitors for analytical purposes; for example, we can tell when you visit our site, how many pages you visit, and how long you remain on the site, as well as when you return.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it; or you can turn off cookies entirely in your browser's preferences. Your access to certain pages of our website may be affected if you do not accept cookies. Check your browser's preferences if you wish to change these settings.

## Email Addresses and Their Usage

Intego asks that you enter an e-mail address on our download pages before downloading trial versions of our software, or if you participate in any beta test, contest, promotion or survey. We may also ask for your name, postal address or other information.

We require that you enter an e-mail address, along with your name, address and payment information, when you make purchases from our online store; your e-mail address is essential in this case, so we can confirm your purchase and send you a serial number for the software you have bought.

We may contact you by e-mail to inform you about updates, special offers, or other software that we think would be of interest to you. Intego does not sell or share your e-mail address with any third party.

## Security of Personal Information

When you purchase Intego software from our online store, all information is sent by SSL (Secure Socket Layer), ensuring that your personal information is encrypted, and cannot be intercepted between your computer and our web server.
