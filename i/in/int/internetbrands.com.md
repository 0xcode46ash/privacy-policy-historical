PRIVACY POLICY

We at Internet Brands, and our wholly-owned affiliates, have designed our business practices to safeguard your privacy. This privacy policy applies to your information that we collect and receive; it does not apply to practices of businesses that we do not own or control or to people we do not employ. Therefore, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other businesses.

You can visit www.internetbrandsinc.com without revealing who you are or providing any personal information about yourself. By using this site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

There will be times, such as when you communicate with us by e-mail, submit an employment, PR, partnership or acquisition inquiry, request information, purchase a product, etc., when we will need to obtain personally identifiable information from you or about you. Such personally identifiable information may include your name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, financial information, references, etc. The information we receive about you or tax ID number from you may be used by us or shared (including evaluating and obtaining products or services) by us with our corporate affiliates, agents, vendors and other third parties to help process your request or complete a transaction; to comply with any law, regulation, audit or court order; to help improve our website or the products or services we offer; for research; to better understand our customers' needs; to develop new offerings; and to alert you to new products and services (of us or our business associates) in which you may be interested. We may also combine information you provide us with information about you that is available to us internally or from other sources. We believe that knowing more about you can enable us to serve you better.

You should be aware that we collect usage information about you when you visit us, which helps us understand how our site is navigated, how many visitors arrive at specific pages, the length and frequency of a stay at our website, etc. In addition, internetbrandsinc.com web pages may place "cookies" on your personal computer. "Cookies" are small identifiers, similar to a license plate, that help us to recognize you if you visit our website again. Cookies are used to help us personalize your viewing experiences. Cookies are not designed to be used to get data from your hard drive, your e-mail or any other personal data about you. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings. Please note, however, that if you reject our cookies it is possible that some web pages may not properly load, your access to certain information might be denied or you might have to enter information about you or your application, inquiry or purchase more than once. We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on inquiry forms on our website or other forms;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others;
  * Information about you we may receive from credit reporting agencies.



We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described above, to corporate affiliates and partners, financial institutions, and other third parties that provide servicing options to process your inquiries or requests. We also may disclose non-public personal information about you to non-affiliated third parties as permitted by law. 

Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. When you submit a financing application, your name, residential address, date of birth and social security number will be used to verify your identity.

We safeguard your personal data (e.g., credit card and finance application information) during electronic transmission from you to us using known encryption, security standards and procedures. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you only to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and other procedural safeguards to comply with applicable privacy laws to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also assess new technology for protecting sensitive customer information on an ongoing basis. However, if your information is forwarded to an affiliate or partner or other third party provider, your information will be transmitted according to the security and privacy policies of that affiliate or partner or third party provider whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your information as shared with outside providers will become subject to those different privacy policies.

Please be aware that we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will update this Privacy Policy at our website, so be sure to check back here frequently. If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or privacy policies, please feel free to e-mail your questions to us at [information@internetbrands.com](mailto:information@internetbrands.com).
