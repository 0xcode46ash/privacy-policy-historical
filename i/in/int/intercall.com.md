Your name, address and contact information is used only for mailing materials you have requested, for informing you about product and service offerings that may be of interest to you, and to help us monitor the effectiveness of our site. If you respond to offerings made on our web site or participate in one of our surveys, you may rest assured that we do not sell, rent or distribute this information in any way to any other organizations. 

Our server cannot automatically collect the e-mail addresses of visitors who do not provide them to us.
