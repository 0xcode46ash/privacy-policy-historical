**Using Your Data**  
It is Intuit's policy that you should know exactly what personal data we collect from you and how we will use it. We collect personal data from you for the purpose of processing your order or enquiry. We may use your personal data to supply products and services to you that you have requested, carry out any agreement with you or take any steps that you have requested. In particular, we may:

  1. Update you as to the status of your order
  2. Alert you to important product revisions or updates
  3. Inform you about upgrades to your purchased Intuit products
  4. Ensure that you are properly registered to receive technical support
  5. We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as shipping your order or offering customer service through our chat feature. These companies are authorised to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us.
  6. We post customer testimonials. We receive permission to post testimonials that include personal data prior to posting.



  
In addition to the above uses, where you have given us appropriate permission, we may also use your personal data for the following purposes and direct marketing ('Additional Purposes'):

  1. To tell you about special discounts on additional Intuit products and services
  2. To advise you about new Intuit products and services
  3. To advise you about new products from other carefully-screened companies that Intuit feels may be of interest to you (we carefully screen and then select such companies only when we are satisfied that their products and/or services are likely to be of interest to you)



Aggregate data is general data about groups of customers and does not identify individual customers. Intuit may combine your data with that of other individuals to create aggregate data which we will use to improve our products & services and develop new ones. For example, we may tell a third party how many people purchased a certain product, but not that you personally purchased a specific item.

You should also be aware that we may occasionally provide links from our Web site to other sites that we think will interest you. If you click on a banner advertisement or any other link, the 'click' will take you off the Intuit site. Once you leave any Intuit Web site, any information that you may have provided remains with us and is not forwarded to the next site to which you have linked. Personal data that you may choose to provide to a third party Web site linked to an Intuit Web site will be subject to the privacy policy of the operators of the third party Web site. Intuit is not responsible for the use or protection of personal data you disclose to a third party Web site operator, even if reached from an Intuit Web site.

**Security and Data Retention**  
The security of your personal information is important to us.  When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.  Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us at [ukprivacy@intuit.com ](mailto:ukprivacy@intuit.com)

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services contact us at ukprivacy@intuit.com.  We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Intuit uses a variety of Web technologies on our Web sites. Among these are cookies and clear gifs, which are pieces of information that our Web sites provide to your browser. Cookies allow us to track overall site usage and determine areas users prefer. Cookies also allow us to customise your visit to our Web sites by recognising you when you return. Cookies cannot be used to see any other data on your computer, nor can they determine your e-mail address or identity. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information

Most browsers accept and maintain cookies by default. Check the Help menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preference. You can choose to decline cookies while at our Web site, but this may limit your ability to access certain areas of the Web site.

To purchase and download products from intuit.co.uk you must ensure your browser is able to accept cookies. Cookies are required for these services to authenticate registered users and to provide access to certain areas of our Web sites that are available to limited registered users only.
