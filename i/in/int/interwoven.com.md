# General Privacy Policy

## Autonomy's Products and Your Privacy

With respect to Autonomy technology and products, Autonomy makes every endeavor to ensure that all of our products enable our customers to protect the privacy of their end-users. However, it is the responsibility of Autonomy customers and partners to implement their Autonomy systems in such a way as to ensure the security of end-user information.

As standard, Autonomy products do not require users to enter any personal information to operate the products, but simply to select a user id and password. Autonomy profiling uses the conceptual context of the information users browse and read, and therefore does not require personal demographic information such as address, age, etc.

In some cases users can optionally elect to have email sent to them, the email address is stored in an encrypted format on the server.

## Autonomy's Website

This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other websites (including those that we link to and third party websites or services that we co-brand) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.

This site recognizes the home server of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses. This site also uses "cookie" technology so that we can better understand how to improve the experience of visiting our website. Also, Autonomy tracks the Internet address of the domains from which visitors are coming and uses this data for statistics and analysis on the levels of success of our web programs, but the name of the visitor remains anonymous.

The names and contact information of persons who request information about Autonomy, its subsidiaries, its products and/or its services are added to our data base in Cambridge, England and San Francisco, US, so that they may be contacted in the future regarding Autonomy's products, services or future opportunities. This contact may occur by e-mail, telephone or mail, as Autonomy deems appropriate. We do not sell or rent any information about our visitors, and we have no plans to do so in the future.

If you give Autonomy your contact information over this Web site, and you wish to have your name removed from Autonomy's database, please write Autonomy at our offices in Cambridge, England, call +44 (0) 1223 448000, or email [webmaster@autonomy.com](mailto:webmaster@autonomy.com).

We may on occasion disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties that wish to inform you of or provide to you certain products and services related to Autonomy solutions. You should understand that personally identifiable information disclosed by us to third parties as well as personally identifiable information disclosed by you to third parties will be used according to such third parties' privacy policies, and that Autonomy can have little control over this information.

We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and secure socket layers where appropriate. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

Autonomy complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Autonomy has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

You acknowledge that acceptance of this privacy policy, as updated from time to time at this location, is a condition to your use of our website and you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions.

If you have any questions regarding our policies please e-mail Autonomy's webmaster at [webmaster@autonomy.com](mailto:webmaster@autonomy.com).
