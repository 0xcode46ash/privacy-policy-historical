# InternetSeer

InternetSeer values and respects your privacy. We do not sell the information we collect from you. It is used to provide you with the Web Site monitoring services we offer. Because our basic monitoring services are free, we support the service by receiving income from sponsors that present you with offers for relevant products and services in the email reports and error notifications that we send to you. If you do not wish to receive such offers, you may subscribe to InternetSeer's premium monitoring service, which provides unsponsored enhanced services starting at only a few dollars per month. For more information, and to subscribe to InternetSeer's premium services, visit [InternetSeer Premium Services](https://web.archive.org/services/premium.jsp). Please note that InternetSeer may, on occasion, provide our business partners and sponsors general aggregate and anonymous information about how our members use our site and their interests (this information will contain no personally identifying information). We do this to help our partners and Sponsors modify their efforts to serve our customer's needs. 

InternetSeer also uses "cookie" technology so that we may identify our members once they arrive at our site. By identifying our members, InternetSeer is able to determine if a member is currently logged into the system. This feature allows the user to see his or her information without having to enter their login name and password each time they send a request. InternetSeer's cookies store minimal information and expire in one of three ways: 

  * 20 minutes with no user activity 
  * user selects "Logout" from the Web site menu 
  * user closes their browser
