Privacy Policy

Interflora British Unit is committed to protecting your privacy. We will only use the information that we collect about you lawfully (in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 & subsequent revisions thereof). We collect information about you for three reasons: to process your order (including payment authorisation), to provide you with the best possible service and to assist in developing the sites content. 

When placing an order, information you provide will be shared with our banking services and distribution providers to ensure your order can be successfully processed and delivered. We will only share relevant information with these parties, all such providers are under obligation to ensure your information is kept private. 

We will not e-mail you in the future unless you have given us your consent (unless to confirm orders). 

We will give you the chance to refuse any marketing e-mail from us or from any other third party companies in the future. 

The type of information we will collect about you includes: 

your name  
address  
phone number (including mobile number)  
e-mail address  
credit/debit card details  
age 

We will never collect sensitive information about you without your explicit consent. 

The information we hold will be accurate and up to date. It is possible to obtain a copy of the information that we hold about you. If you find any inaccuracies we will delete or correct it promptly. A nominal charge of Â£10 is made to cover administrative costs involved. Should you require a copy of such information, please write to us at:

The personal information which we hold will be held securely in accordance with our internal security policy and English law. Further information about our site security can be viewed by clicking here. 

If we intend to transfer your information outside the EEA (European Economic Area) for uses other than order fulfilment, we will always obtain your consent first. 

We may use technology to track the patterns of behaviour of registered and non-registered visitors to our site. This can include using a "cookie" which would be stored on your browser. You can usually modify your browser to prevent this happening (for example, using Internet Explorer select 'internet options' from the 'tools' menu, then click 'security', followed by 'custom level' and select 'disable cookies'). The information collected in this way can be used to identify you unless you modify your browser settings. We also aggregate this data to perform statistical analyses of the characteristics and behaviour of our registered users and non-registered visitors. Cookies are also used as a further means of ensuring private and secure purchase sessions are operated within the site. 

We may use third-party advertising companies to serve advertisements on our behalf. These companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely anonymous. Your browser can be modified to not accept cookies - guidance for which is provided in the paragraph above. 

Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service, for instance, the My Account service, or when you order a product. We will need certain information such as your name, address, credit card number in order to provide you with that service or product. Furthermore, we may also use that information to let you know of additional products or services that we feel may be of interest to you. You can easily choose not to receive such information by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. 

Every time you connect to our website we store a log of your visit which shows the unique number your machine uses when it is connected to the internet (IP address). This tells us what you looked at; whether the page request was successful or not and which browser you use to view the pages. The use of this data is strictly for statistical purposes only. This helps us to understand which areas of the site are of particular interest and also which pages are not being requested. It also tells how many people are visiting the website in total. 

Data collected during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. If this is the case we will inform you at the point of collection whether your personal data will be shared with others as a result of your participation. 

Interflora may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information we will notify you by email or an announcement on the website. 

If you have any questions/comments about privacy, you should [email us](mailto:sales.enquiries@interflora.co.uk?subject=Privacy%20Policy).
