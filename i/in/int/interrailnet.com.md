At various locations on our websites, such as in our order forms (and potentially surveys and polls), we may request that you supply us with "personal information," such as your name, email address, mailing and shipping addresses, home or work telephone number, and/or credit card information. You will always know when we are collecting personal information, because we only collect personal information when you voluntarily submit it to us through our online forms and questionnaires. Although you do not have to provide us with any information to visit our websites, you may not be able to fully utilize all of the services on our websites if you choose not to provide certain information. If you do choose to give us personal information through our websites, we will collect and retain that information.

When you use our websites, we may also collect "non-personal information," which is information that, by itself, cannot be used to identify or contact you, such as demographic information (your age, gender, income, education, profession, zip code, etc.).

For example, cookies allow our websites to recognize your browser as a previous visitor, and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set while you were previously browsing our websites. Our cookies can also store information you have placed in a "shopping cart."

### IV. Security of the Information We Collect

The security of your personal information is important to us. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to secure your personal information. However, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, and there is always some risk in transmitting information electronically. This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The site employs SSL via a digital certificate issued by Verisign.

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to our [customer service](http://www.interrailnet.com/support/contact).

Any questions you may have regarding our Privacy Policy, the accuracy of your personal information or the use of your personal information, or any requests that we correct, update, or remove your information in our databases, should be directed via email to [customer service](http://www.interrailnet.com/support/contact).

After receiving a request to change your information, we will make reasonable efforts to ensure that all of your personal information stored in databases we actively use to operate our website will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable. However, we reserve the right to retain in our archival files any information we remove from or change in our active website databases. We may retain such information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our terms of use.

This Policy is effective as of April 1, 2007. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time, and will post any changes to this Policy as soon as they go into effect. Please refer back to this Policy on a regular basis.
