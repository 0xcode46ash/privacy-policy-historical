**Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates.

**Log Files  
** Like most standard website servers, we also use log files. They include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use them to analyse trends, administer the site, track a user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Anonymous survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website.

However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Our sites also link to many other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information  
** If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information.

Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner.
