# internet world online

During the registration process, we ask about your specific needs and interests. This information is passed to relevant sponsors as well as those whose stands you visit during your visit. We let our hall sponsors know if you’ve been in their hall and our site sponsor gets to see everyone. We, of course, let all sponsors know what your preferred method of communication is and it’s up to them if they want to contact you or not.

The entire experience is designed to give you access to as much information about as possible and to introduce you to key companies. In the end, our goal is to provide you with an educational resource and empower you to make an informed buying decision.

That’s how it works! And of course, it’s 100% free.

The rest of this page outlines the specifics of our privacy policy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Client Services +44 (0)1423 529 648 or email [clientservices@webeventseurope.com](mailto:clientservices@webeventseurope.com)

If you do not agree with the terms of this policy and do not wish to be contacted about the services and products mentioned in it you are advised not to register for this event.

 **Information Collection**  
Penton Media is the owner of all information collected on internetworld365.com. WebEvents Ltd. operates this site on behalf on Penton Media but has no rights or interest in any information collected on the site. We collect personal identifying information such as your name, email address, postal address and phone number along with basic demographic information about your job and place of business. The ways we use the information are outlined below. 

**Registration**  
Some areas of internetworld365 require registration. During registration you will be asked to provide contact information, demographic information, express areas of interest, and preferred method of contact. This information may be shared with certain sponsors of internetworld365 for the purpose of contacting you regarding the services and products on our site for which you expressed interest. If you do not agree with these terms and do not wish to be contacted, you are advised not to register for this web site.

 **Profile**  
We store your registration information and preferences in a profile kept on internetworld365. The profile is used to tailor your visit to our web site and to direct appropriate communications from internetworld365 and our sponsors. You may access and modify your profile at any time after logging in to the site.

 **Cookies**  
This section confirms that we use cookies on our sites, and makes it clear why we do so.

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user chooses to reject the cookie, they may still use our site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

**Log Files**  
Like most standard website servers, we also use log files. They include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use them to analyse trends, administer the site, track a user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

 **Email Communications**  
We send all newly registered users a welcome email to verify username and password. Established users will occasionally receive and update on new content and developments around internetworld365. You have the option to not receive these communications either by clicking a link in the email communication or by sending an email to clientservices@webeventseurope.com. 

**Client Services**  
We communicate with users on a regular basis to deliver service and address issues. We do in accordance with their wishes and instructions.

 **Legal Disclaimer**  
Though we make every effort to preserve users' privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current or pending judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website.

 **Sharing Personal Information**  
We share personal information with those parties who feature on our site. If you have entered the site via an advertisement on one of our affiliate web sites, in some cases we may share your personal information with the owners of that site. When users tick keyword preferences during the registration process, we share names, company names and addresses, job titles, email addresses, telephone numbers, market sectors and size of businesses with exhibitors that have requested those keywords. We will give hall sponsors your details if you have visited the hall they have sponsored during your time on the site, and a site sponsor will receive the details of everyone who registers on the site. We may also share your personal information with non-related parties (i.e. companies other than Penton Media, Webevents Ltd and www.internetworld365.com exhibitors) who we believe may have related products or services of interest to you. This is so that they can contact you about these products and services as well as contact you about offers, promotions and marketing materials unless the user has chosen to opt-out of receiving information from non-related parties when registering for the online exhibition. Users' profiles are shared with such non-related parties together with personally identifiable information.

 **Business Transitions**  
In the event that Penton Media and/or Webevents Ltd are subjected to a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our website 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If, as a result of the business transition, we have reason to believe that the users' personal information is likely to be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our Notification of Changes section below.

 **Links**  
This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Penton Media and Webevents Ltd are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this website. 

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose personal information. In such circumstances, information will be shared with the contest/survey sponsors in order to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information will be used for the purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this website. 

**Tell-A-Friend**  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our website, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. Penton Media and Webevents Ltd will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site.

 **Security**  
We use reasonable precautions to keep the personal information that you disclose to us secure and to disclose such information only within the above guidelines. Where information is shared, it is only to third parties we believe to be responsible. However, we are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that receive the information. Our sites also link to many other sites and we are not responsible for their privacy policies or practices.

 **Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing [clientservices@webeventseurope.com](mailto:clientservices@webeventseurope.com)

 **Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we reserve the right to do so, and will notify users that we have done so on the home page. 

If we need to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. If users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our website notifying users of the change.
