In The Swim was founded in 1982 by a husband and wife team. Shipping chlorine from the back of their garage and taking orders on their front porch, they began to have a vision that this could be something big.

As the quantities of their orders increased, so did the loyalty of their customers. Before long, In The Swim relocated to a larger facility and hired their first employees to answer the phone. As In The Swim’s customers grew in number, so did the product selection.

The one constant factor of In The Swim’s growth has been maintaining the highest level of customer satisfaction through its dedication to quality products at the best possible prices and its commitment to the highest level of customer service.
