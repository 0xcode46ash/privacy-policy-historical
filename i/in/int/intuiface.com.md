# Privacy Policy -- IntuiFace Presentation

###  Privacy Policy Statement

IntuiLab respects its Users’ privacy and is committed to protecting any personal information shared with IntuiLab. This statement describes how IntuiLab uses personal information shared by Users.

###  Personal Information

Personal information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, such as a first and last name, email address, a home, postal or other physical address, other contact information, title, occupation, industry, personal interests, and other information. IntuiLab does not automatically collect personal information, including Users’ email address. IntuiLab does log Users’ IP addresses, but does not link such IP addresses to any personal information unless such was voluntarily provided by Users. The Site may use standard technologies, such as “cookies” and other HTML tools, to collect information about the use of the Site. IntuiLab may collect personal information when such is voluntarily provided by Users (for example: if Users request further information, register to a mailing list, etc.) Also, IntuiLab may receive personal information from business partners and vendors. IntuiLab only uses such information if it has been collected in accordance with acceptable privacy practices consistent with this Privacy Statement and applicable laws. Access to certain IntuiLab web pages requires a login and a password. Unless the User requests deactivation of his or her personal information as specified below, his or her personal information may be retained by IntuiLab to verify compliance with any applicable agreements and understandings, log software licenses granted, track software downloaded from those pages, or track usage of other applications available on those pages.

###  Notice

When personal information is collected, IntuiLab will so inform Users and shall also inform the Users of the purpose of the collection. IntuiLab will not transfer Users’ personal information to third parties without their specific consent, except under the limited conditions described under the discussion entitled “Information Sharing and Disclosure” below. IntuiLab provides its Users with the opportunity to “opt in” prior to receiving direct marketing or market research information. In other words, IntuiLab will require its Users’ affirmative action before it may use their information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted. At all times, IntuiLab will always give its Users the opportunity to “opt out” of receiving such materials.

###  Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

IntuiLab uses common Internet technologies, such as cookies and IP addresses, to keep track of interactions with the Company's website and software.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to Users’ computer’s hard drive when such Users visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the Site uses to track the pages visited by Users, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information provided by Users. Some parts of the Site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. A User who prefers not to receive cookies while browsing the Site or via HTML-formatted emails can customize his or her browser to warn him or her before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when his or her browser alerts him or her to its presence. A User can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in his or her browser, which refusal may adversely affect the User’s experience.

**IP Addresses**  
When you visit IntuiLab Web sites, or launch Composer and Player, the Company collects your Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses. Doing so enables IntuiLab 1) for the Web: to track and aggregate non-personal information, 2) for Composer/Player: to check license status and product stability. For example, IntuiLab uses IP addresses to monitor the regions from which Customers and Visitors navigate the Company’s websites.

###  How IntuiLab May Use Information Collected

IntuiLab uses information for several general purposes: to fulfill Users’ requests for certain products and services, to personalize Users’ experience on the Site, to maintain ongoing contacts with its Users, to improve its products using crash report information, and to better understand its Users’ needs and provide them with better services. IntuiLab may also use Users’ information to send them, or to have its business partners send them, direct marketing information or contact them for market research.

###  Information Sharing and Disclosure

Users’ personal information is never shared with third parties without the Users’ permission, except under any of the following circumstances:

  * When a User has expressed his or her consent to share such information;
  * If sharing such information is necessary to provide a product or service requested by a User (in which case, IntuiLab will only provide to such third parties the information they need to deliver the service. Also, such companies are prohibited from using Users’ information for any other purpose);
  * As part of a joint sales promotion or to pass sales leads to one of IntuiLab’s distribution partners; and
  * IntuiLab may also disclose Users’ personal information if required to do so by law, to enforce IntuiLab’s Terms of Use, or in urgent circumstances, to protect personal safety, the public or the Site.



###  Deactivation of Users Information

A User may request deactivation of his or her account or any of his or her personal information held by us by sending an email to info [at] intuilab [dot] com. If a User chooses to deactivate his or her account, IntuiLab may retain in its files some personal information, to prevent fraud, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, enforce its Terms of Use, and comply with legal requirements as permitted by law.

###  Data Security

Users’ account information is password-protected. IntuiLab shall safeguard the security of data provided by Users with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. In certain areas of our websites, IntuiLab uses industry-standard SSL-encryption to enhance the security of sensitive data transmissions. However, IntuiLab cannot ensure the complete security of the information transmitted by Users.

###  Third Party Sites

IntuiLab’s website contains links to other sites. IntuiLab does not share its Users’ personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices.

###  Changes to this Privacy Statement

IntuiLab may amend this privacy statement from time to time. In case that any substantial changes are made in such Privacy Statement, IntuiLab will make that information known to its Users by posting a notice on the Site.

###  Questions or Suggestions
