# Privacy Policy | InterTrader

## Data Protection Act

LCG may process information relating to you (including personal data as defined under the Data Protection Act 1998), including holding such information in a manual format or electronic database, in order to satisfy any contractual, regulatory or statutory requirements we may have. Unless we receive specific written instructions to the contrary, by providing this information you agree that we may process this information in order to fulfill such obligations.

## Privacy Policy

**Introduction:**

Protecting the security and privacy of your personal information is important to LCG and to the way it conducts its business in compliance with laws on privacy, data protection and data security. LCG hopes the policy outlined below will help you understand what information LCG may collect, how it uses and safeguards that information and with whom it may share it.  


At LCG, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of integrity in our business. In the course of our business, it is necessary to collect Personal Information about our potential clients. We take this activity seriously and seek to provide fair, secure and appropriate methods for the handling of Personal Information. All such activities are intended to be consistent with both generally accepted privacy ethics and standard business practices. Your Personal Information may be shared with a limited number of trusted partners and/or affiliates of LCG where such use is restricted to the management of your account and will not breach any elements of the UK Data Protection Act 1998.

If you have any questions or comments about LCG’s Privacy Policy, you can contact our Customer Support Team: [support@capitalspreads.com](mailto:support@capitalspreads.com) or +44 (0)20 7456 7020

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Through its websites, LCG will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (e.g. your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address ("personal information")), unless you voluntarily choose to provide it (e.g. by registration, email enquiry, survey). If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it. When you do provide personal information, LCG usually uses it to respond to your enquiry, or provide you access to specific account information, and to support its customer relationship with you.

LCG may store and process personal information and share it within the LCG group of companies to better understand your business needs and how LCG can improve its products and services; or LCG (or a third party on its behalf) may use Personal Information to contact you about a LCG offer in support of your business needs or to conduct online surveys to understand better its customers' needs and profiles.

If you choose not to have your personal information used to support its customer relationship programmes (especially direct-marketing or market-research), LCG will respect your choice. LCG do not now (and do not intend to in the future) sell, rent or otherwise market your personal information to third parties.

You may opt out of receiving marketing emails at any time by selecting the 'unsubscribe' link at the top of the emails or by emailing [support@capitalspreads.com](mailto:support@capitalspreads.com) with your request.
