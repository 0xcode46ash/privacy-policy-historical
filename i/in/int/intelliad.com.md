#### Collected data for Webtracking

In the course of tracking, we collect and analyze some information for our web controlling. This information is transmitted by your browser. The data collection is processed by a pixel which is integrated on every web page. The following data are collected automatically: - Request (Data name of requested file) (Example www.example.com/index.html) – Browser type/version (Example: Internet Explorer 6.0) – Browser language (Example: German) – Used operating system (Example: Windows XP) – Inner resolution of browser window – display resolution – Javascript activation – Java On/Off – Cookies On/Off – Color Depth – Referer URL (the site visited before) – IP address – is anonymized and deleted instantly – Time of access – Clicks –Order values, if necessary 

#### IP Address

The IP address is transmitted at every server request, so that the server knows where the corresponding answer needs to be sent. The IP address is provided by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) as soon as a user connects with the internet and the ISP can understand which IP address is assigned to which client at a certain time. As long as the IP address is stored, the identity of the user can theoretically be determined via the ISP. Therefore, we save the IP address in (anonymized) form and only use them to recognize the session, for geo-localization (until city –level) and for the defense of attacks. The IP address is deleted instantly so that the collected data are anonymous and the identification of the user’s identity via ISPs is no longer possible.
