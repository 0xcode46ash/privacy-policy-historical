In addition to the specific situations discussed above, we disclose Personal Data in the following situations:

               **User Profiles.  **The Grindr App is a social networking platform that is designed to allow users to share information.  When you use the Grindr App, your Profile Information is public, and other users of the Grindr App can see your Profile Information and other Personal Data (including sensitive personal data) posted by you.  For example, other users can search for you, search for your profile characteristics, or see you listed as being in their vicinity. Do **_not_** include information in your profile that you want to keep private.  While the Grindr App may permit you to make certain items (e.g., Profile Information, preferences, opinions of other users, or other information) non-public, sophisticated users who use the Grindr App in an unauthorized manner may nevertheless be able to obtain this information and may be able to determine your identity. 

               **Distance Information.**   **The Grindr App is designed to allow users to share Distance Information. As a result, Distance Information is public, and other users of the Grindr App can see your Distance Information (including how many feet or meters you are from them). Grindr App users can use the search feature in the Grindr App to search for other users by distance or in a particular geographic vicinity. Your Distance Information will be used for these searches. Sophisticated users who use the Grindr App in an unauthorized manner, or other users who change their location while you remain in the same location, may use this information to determine your exact location and may be able to determine your identity.   Please note: even if you choose to hide your Distance Information, the Grindr App will continue to sort and display your profile based on your relative distance from other users, so your Distance Information may still be approximated by other users. Thus, even if you choose to hide your Distance Information, others may nevertheless be able to determine your location.**

               **Third Party Tracking Companies**. We may share your hashed Device ID, Profile Information, Distance Information, and demographic information with our advertising and analytics partners. These third parties may also collect information directly from you as described in this Privacy Policy. The privacy policy of these third party companies applies to their collection, use and disclosure of your information. For example, one of our many partners is Google Analytics which collects information anonymously and report website trends without identifying individual visitors. 

               **Third Party Service Providers**. We may share your Personal Data with third party service providers to: provide you with the Grindr Services; conduct quality assurance testing; provide technical support; and/or to provide other services to Grindr.  Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, these third party service providers are required by contract not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by Grindr.

               **Partner Promotion**. We may offer contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions with third party partners.  If you decide to enter a contest, sweepstakes, or promotion that is sponsored by a third party partner the information that you provide will be shared with us and with them.  Their use of your information is not governed by this privacy policy. 

               **Affiliates and Acquisitions**. We may share your Personal Data with our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control.  If another company acquires our company, business, or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Policy.

               **Behavioral Advertising On Websites**: Our websites may participate in third party behavioral advertising. This means that a third party may use technology (e.g., a cookie) to collect information about your use of our websites so that they can provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests.  That advertising may appear either on our website, or on other websites not operated by Grindr.  If you do not want third parties who collect information about your use of our website or applications to tailor any of the advertising that you see, you can opt-out at the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/) in the US, the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) in Canada, or the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in Europe.

               **Behavioral Advertising Outside Of The Grindr App**. Grindr works with advertisers who wish to distribute relevant and interesting ads to Grindr users while the users are on other apps or websites not operated by Grindr.  If you donÕt want advertisements sent to you on those apps or websites because of your affiliation with Grindr, you may change the Behavioral Advertising settings on your device (discussed above) and/or opt out through the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://optout.aboutads.info/) in the US, the [Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada](http://youradchoices.ca/) in Canada, or the [European Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) in Europe.

               **Effect Of Opting Out Of Behavioral Advertising.**  Please note that opting-out of behavioral advertising does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using the Grindr Services.  It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms.

               **Changes To Your Personal Data**. Grindr relies on you to update and correct your Personal Data.  You can modify or delete your profile within the Grindr Services.  Please note that Grindr may keep historical information and content in our backup files and archives as permitted by law and to the extent we anticipate that the information may be required in connection with the original purpose of the collection, or as otherwise permitted or required by law.  

               **Deletion Of Your Personal Data**. Typically we retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required for the operation of the Grindr Services or permitted by law.  You may, however, request that we delete your Personal Data.  All requests must be directed to the contact in the Contact InformationÓ section of the Grindr Services.  We may also decide to delete your data at any time if we believe that the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or that our continued use and storage are contrary to our obligations to other individuals or third parties.  When we delete Personal Data, it will be removed from our active database, but in some circumstances, it may remain in certain archives where it is not practical or possible to delete it. In addition, we may keep your Personal Data and usage history (which includes a history of text or photos that have been censored, banned) as needed to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and/or enforce any of our agreements.

If you revoke your consent for the processing of Personal Data, then we will no longer be able to provide the Grindr Services.

               **Access To Your Personal Data**. If required by law, upon request, Grindr will grant a user reasonable access to the Personal Data that Grindr holds about the user. All requests must be directed to the contact in the Contact InformationÓ section of the Grindr Services.
