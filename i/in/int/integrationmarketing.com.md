**What Information Is Collected And How Is It Used?**

Information is collected from users in the following areas of this site: 

  1. **Registration:** Information is collected from visitors when they register to receive a free copy of _Integration Marketing,_ an ebook by Mark Joyner. In order to receive the ebook, visitors are required to provide their name and their email address. This information is used to: 

>     * deliver the free ebook _Integration Marketing_ to the visitor; and  
>  
>     * assign the visitor with an Associate ID, which they can use when referring friends to [www.integrationmarketing.com](http://www.integrationmarketing.com/) (for more information see "Tell A Friend" below) 
>     * to update the visitor about this website and provide content related to Integration Marketing.

  2. **Support Desk:** Information such as name and email address is required when a visitor submits a query to the Integration Marketing support desk.  This information is required so that the customer care team may respond to that query, and the visitor may track the progress of their complaint online. The information collected is used solely for purpose of resolving the visitor's complaint or query.   
 
  3. **Tell a Friend:** When visitors sign up to receive the ebook titled _Integration Marketing_ , we present them with the option of telling their friends about _Integration Marketing_. If the visitor elects to use the TAF tool provided for passing on an invitation to our web site, we ask the referrer for their friend’s name and email address for the purpose of sending the friend a one-time email containing a link to our web site. The communication sent to the friend includes an explanation of how the friend came to receive the email and a link to our support desk if they have any concerns. Mark Joyner, Inc stores the information collected via this tool on a log file, but does not use it for any purpose other than to send this one-time invitation. The visitor is not obligated to tell any friends about _Integration Marketing_. 



**Associate Program**

All visitors who register to receive a copy of _Integration Marketing_ , are assigned an Associate ID obtained from their email address, which they can use to refer others to our website. In addition, any unique friends that they refer via our Tell-A-Friend form becomes parsed with their Associate ID. This means that the visitor can earn a commission on any purchase made by their referred friends at our website. In order to receive commission payments, visitors are requested also to provide us with their PayPal address. Visitors are not obligated to do this or partake in the associate program. We do not provide any other forms of commission payment outside of PayPal.
