**Statistics**  
When you visit www.interviewexchange.com our computers may automatically collect statistics about your visit. This information does not identify you personally, but rather about a visit to our site. We may monitor statistics such as how many people visit our site, the user's IP address, which pages people visit, from which domains our visitors come and which browsers people use. These statistics are used for internal purposes only. These statistics are used to help us improve the performance of our services.

**Cookies/ Log Files/ Clear Gifs**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. We are using session ID cookies only. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to participate in viewing the public profile of other applicants etc

Like most standard web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather aggregate demographic information for analysis. IP addresses are linked to personally identified information upon login. For log file analysis we are currently not using any particular software. We are not employing any clear gifs.

We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties 

**Business Transitions**  
In the event The Interview Exchange goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email prior to a change of ownership or control and potential transfer of personal information to another business entity.

**Processing Payments:** (when you are using our payment services)  
If you use The Interview Exchange Payment Services payment gateway for online transactions, we may provide your personal information to appropriate financial institutions, processors, and third parties under contract with The Interview Exchange for providing a subset of the payment services (for example, credit authorization, address verification). For financial institutions and processors, the use of personally identifiable consumer information is governed by federal and state privacy laws. For other third parties under contract with The Interview Exchange, the use and distribution of your personal information will be used by such entity for its internal use related to fulfilling the transaction services for The Interview Exchange. All information will be treated as confidential by this entity, and will be transferred between The Interview Exchange and this entity only via encrypted means. 

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time we may request information from customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use of and satisfaction with this Web site, and improving our customer service.

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about SSL, follow this link http://www.verisign.com/products/site/faq/128-bit.html. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email [privacy@adamshand.net](mailto:privacy@adamshand.net)

**Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, users may make changes or deactivations at the user registration/account information page. 

**Notification of Changes**  
If changes are made to this privacy policy, changes will be posted within this privacy statement. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.   
If, however, users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email of such changes. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if any material changes are made in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change.
