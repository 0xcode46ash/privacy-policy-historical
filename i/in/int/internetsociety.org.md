### Cross Border Transfers

If you visit our Sites from a country other than the United States, your communications will likely result in the transfer of your Personal Data across national borders. Our servers or offices may be located in countries other than the country from which you access our Sites, also resulting in the transfer of your Personal Data across international borders. If you provide your Personal Data when visiting one of our Sites from outside of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that this data may be transferred from your then current location to our offices and servers and to those of our affiliates, agents, and service providers located in the United States and in other countries. **The United States and such other countries may not have the same level of data protection as those that apply in the jurisdiction where you live.**

For site visitors who reside in the European Union, we will only transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Union to those (a) jurisdictions with “adequate protection” as used in the General Data Protection Regulation governing transfer of personal data outside of the European Union (the “GDPR”), or (b) those entities that have instituted appropriate safeguards as contemplated by the GDPR. In the absence of either of the matters described above, we will only transfer your Personal Data outside of the European Union with your express informed consent.

### How do We Collect Information?

We collect Personal Data in four basic ways:

  * You give it to us when you set up an account with us or register for an event including but not limited to webinars, signing up for a newsletter or making a comment on a blog or social media;
  * Responding to email inquiries or public calls for comments;
  * We automatically collect certain technical information when you visit our Sites, such as type of browser, operating system version and Internet protocol or IP address; and
  * We obtain legally available information from outside sources, including commercially available geographic and demographic information along with other publicly available information, such as public posts to social networking sites.



### What Information Do We collect?

As indicated above, certain information is automatically collected and reflected in our web server logs. We make no attempt to link this information with you or any other individual visitors to the Sites.

On the Sites, we give you the option of providing certain personally identifiable information, for purposes such as joining our organization, renewing your membership, participating in discussion groups, submitting inquiries and comments, or registering for a webinar or our conferences or events. This is your Personal Data and may include name, title, company/organization name, postal address, email address, work, home and mobile phone numbers and other pertinent data. This information is used only for the purposes and permitted uses described at the time of collection and for purposes permitted under this Privacy Statement.

### How Do We Use Your Personal Data and Other Data Collected at Our Sites?

We do not sell, rent, or share any Personal Data supplied by you unless we first obtain your express informed consent. We may occasionally share Personal Data with third party subcontractors to perform services on our behalf, but only on contractual terms requiring compliance with the obligations under this Privacy Statement and other contractual terms that protect against misuse and unauthorized disclosure of Personal Data. Members may choose whether or not to receive these services.

We may use Personal Data to provide you with more effective customer service and to improve the Sites and any related products or services we may provide or make available. We may use your Personal Data to provide you with important information about the product or service that you are using, including critical updates and notifications. We occasionally hire other companies, consultants, and contractors to provide limited services on our behalf, such as website hosting, public relations, mailing, answering customer questions about products and services, and sending information including but not limited to our research, white papers, policy positions and events. We will only provide those companies the Personal Data they need to deliver the relevant product or service. They are required by contract to maintain the confidentiality of the Personal Data and are prohibited from using Personal Data for any other purpose. Except as set forth in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell or share any Personal Data to or with third parties. We may disclose Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or the Sites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of our employees and staff, agents, users of our products or services, or members of the public, or (d) effect any merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, in which case you will be provided notice of the following via email and/or a prominent notice on the relevant Site, (i) the change in ownership, (ii) the uses of your Personal Data in the transaction, and (iii)choices you may have regarding your Personal Data.

In addition to your Personal Data, we may also collect non-personally identifiable information, and anonymous analytics such as how many visitors we have to the Sites, when those visitors used the Sites, browser types and other information that is either aggregated or otherwise not associated with any individual visitor.  We may use this information to periodically analyze Site logs to assess aggregate usage trends in order to better serve the needs of visitors to the Sites and maximize the user viewing experience. Under some circumstances this information may be used for purposes of systems administration, fraud prevention or server troubleshooting and security.

The Sites may collect certain anonymous information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; pages that you access while at the Site, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Site. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. This information is used to help improve the Site, analyze trends, and administer the Site.

All of our practices are designed and intended at a minimum to satisfy state, national, provincial and federal legal requirements limiting email communications. In addition to these laws and regulations governing email marketing there are other laws and regulations governing telemarketing and direct mail.

When you conduct transactions through a Site, payment and payment card information for transactions with us is entered directly into a third-party processor’s systems and is not transmitted through or stored by us. The card processor provides us with an authorization code which is securely stored with the payment record on our servers.

ISOC is a strong advocate of privacy enhancing technologies including our efforts with respect to encryption (see <https://www.internetsociety.org/encryption>).

In addition, where feasible, data is stored encrypted. If your browser does not support HTTPS encryption, you are encouraged to contact us by phone or in writing.

Our databases and system administration logs, are restricted to access by authorized and authenticated users.
