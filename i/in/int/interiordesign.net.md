This Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") applies to information collected by and from Sandow Media LLC's ("Sandow," "we," or "us") websites, mobile websites, apps and the like (the "Sandow Properties"). Sandow is committed to protecting the privacy of its Users ("Users," or "you"). We have created the following Privacy Statement to give you an overview of the type of information we collect, how the information is used and how the information is safeguarded. Information is collected from Users by Sandow through the use of the Sandow Properties. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Sandow.

**A. WHAT INFORMATION IS COLLECTED?**

In order to personalize and improve your experience throughout the Sandow Properties, we collect information about our Users in a variety of ways. In some cases, Sandow asks Users directly for information in order for them to purchase products or use our services, and, in other cases, information is collected automatically as Users are using Sandow Properties. You may choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to purchase products or take advantage of certain features we offer.

The following is a summary of the kinds of information we collect:

1\. Active Collection. 

Sandow collects certain information either voluntarily or as required in order to register with Sandow or use certain Sandow services or features. This type of information includes:

· Contact information, such as name, company name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone and FAX numbers.  
· Shipping or transaction information, such as billing address and financial information (credit card number and expiration date) if you choose to purchase products offered for sale on one or more of the Sandow Properties.   
· Demographic information about the User and/or the User's company/institution.  
· Information you enter in forms and optional surveys or contests, such as name and e-mail address.  
· Information provided in connection with discussions on bulletin boards, in chat rooms, and in messaging or other interactive services.  
· Information provided in e-mail requests and communications.  
· Information from other sources. In order to personalize our services by providing better product recommendations or special offers we may think will interest you, we may request and receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily. In addition, we may acquire User names, e-mail addresses and mailing addresses for select mailings from third parties.

2\. Passive Collection

Some information is collected automatically while you are using Sandow Properties. It is important to note that Sandow stores this information to ensure its Users receive optimal service while using Sandow services. This type of information includes:

Log files are used to track user usage and engagement and to gauge the effectiveness of our different services. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer Sandow Web sites.  
· Cookies: Sandow Web sites use cookies to allow us to recognize you when you return to our site and to provide you with customized services and information. Although we do not store personal information in cookies, we do sometimes tie cookies to User member IDs, which is then used to pull personal information out of the database for identification purposes. If Users reject a cookie placed by Sandow, they may not be able to use some Sandow Web site services (e.g., purchase products or establish a User Account).  
· Sandow also uses third parties to provide services to you on behalf of Sandow, and in doing so they may set cookies on the site for functionality such as Live Chat and web analytic services. If you reject these cookies, you may not be permitted to use these features. Also, we use a third party to provide web analytic services which allows Sandow to track website usage statistics and checkout information. For additional information regarding the information made available to third parties by Sandow, see _How Does Sandow Use the Information Collected_ provided below.

For information on how to have your browser disable cookies or provide a warning before accepting a cookie, please refer to the cookie options in your browser's Options or Preferences menu.

· Sandow employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content across our sites by informing us what content is effective. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. In addition, clear gifs may be set by third parties to track sales resulting from Internet advertising campaigns and banner advertisements appearing on other web sites. If Users would like to opt-out of these e-mails, they should see the Opt-out section.

For more information, see our _Notification of Changes_ section below.  
· Sandow will disclose personal information if necessary to fulfill our service obligations or if required to do so by law or if in our good faith judgment, such action is reasonably necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on Sandow, to respond to any claims, or protect the rights of Sandow and its Users and the public.

Sandow may offer links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Sandow is not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked sites, including sites of our partners. We encourage our Users to be aware of this when they leave any of the Sandow Properties and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. 

**G. SURVEYS AND CONTESTS**

From time to time, our sites request information from Users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information or your name and e-mail address. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of Sandow Web sites.
