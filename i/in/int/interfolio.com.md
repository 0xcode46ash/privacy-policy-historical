Interfolio's Privacy Pledge

Effective August 10, 2007  
  


  1. We do not sell, rent or trade any personally identifiable information you provide when using the Interfolio website ("Interfolio"). With your consent, we will share your credentials (writing samples, transcripts, letters of recommendation, cover letters and other stored documents) with potential employers, schools, or career centers, for the purpose in which you intend.
  2. We do not collect any personally identifiable information about you when you use Interfolio unless you specifically decide to provide such. If you choose to provide an email address as part of using Interfolio, we will not send an email to you unless you specifically request an email response to a customer service inquiry, or contact is required in order to protect someone's safety, or to enforce our Terms of Service, or it becomes necessary in order to fulfill service requests. Our site's registration form requires you to give us contact information (like your name, school, address and email address). Your contact information will be used to fulfill your service requests, or reach you in the event that there is a problem with your request. Financial information such as credit card number and expiration date is collected solely to bill you for products and services, and only when you choose to provide it. Sensitive information such as social security number is collected solely for identity verification.  
To change information that you have previously provided Interfolio, you may log in to your account at [http://www.interfolio.com](http://www.interfolio.com/) and edit the information on your 'settings' page. You may also contact Interfolio's Customer Support to change this information by emailing [help@interfolio.com](https://web.archive.org/file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/Anke%20Mackenthun/Desktop/interfolio/help@interfolio.com) or by calling 877-77-FOLIO.
  3. We automatically collect information such as IP address, browser type, domain name, and access times. This information will merely be used to gather statistics, help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site.
  4. When you visit Interfolio, we place a small text file -- called a "cookie" -- on your computer that allows us to identify your computer during the time that you are logged into Interfolio's system. You must have cookies enabled to use Interfolio's services. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, and store your session information. Importantly, a cookie does not allow us to obtain ANY identifiable information about you or your account.  
Some of our business partners (the Support Center) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Interfolio only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers
  5. We engage in a contract with each firm that has access to an aspect of our system and hold them to the same standards of privacy and security to which we hold ourselves. Interfolio has strategic relationships with several firms to provide technological services to the company. These include dedicated web-server hosting, credit card transaction processing, and secure information backup services. These partnerships have been created to offer the highest level of security and protection for the data on our systems, and to offer our users the best service possible. The service providers use your personally identifiable information for the sole purpose of providing Interfolio with the service requested.
  6. Interfolio has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control:  

    * Access to confidential data is limited by user name and password to the appropriate user, and only the appropriate user can authorize consent for that information to be released to others.  

    * Password and document identification numbers are encrypted in the database.
    * Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption is used to communicate with you.
    * Each password must be a minimum of seven characters, including at least one numeric or special character.
    * You cannot see information to which you have waived your right of access.
  7. If Interfolio is ever sold, or all or substantially all of the assets relating to Interfolio are transferred to another entity, we will transfer the information you have provided to the acquiring entity in order to ensure continuity of your service, and you will be notified by an email sent to the email address that you have placed on file with us.
  8. We recognize and welcome our obligation to comply with the law and this policy is subject to that obligation. We will, therefore, disclose personally identifiable information in response to a request from law enforcement officials or as otherwise required by law, or if we believe it is necessary to protect someone's safety, or enforce our Terms of Service.
  9. _Tell-A-Friend_  
If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Interfolio does not store this information.
  10. _Disclosure to Third Parties_  
Interfolio does not share personally identifiable information with Third Parties except in the case described here. We use a credit card processing company to bill you for goods and services. They do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
  11. If we decide to materially change this privacy policy, we will prominently post those changes on this page and notify you via email at least thirty days prior to using it. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your information in this different manner.
