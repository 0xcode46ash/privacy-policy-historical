**Privacy Policy** **Information Collection and Use**  
Intrapromote is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We may decide from time to time to collect information from our users at several different points on our web site. Intrapromote will not sell, share, or rent this information (including all information discussed throughout this Privacy Statement) to other parties in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement except when required to comply with applicable laws in a legal investigation. As an exception, Intrapromote may periodically compile aggregated data from its site to compile industry statistics suitable for presentation. Such data will not be linked in any way to specific users, email addresses, or organizations.

**Registration**  
In order to use portions of this web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give his or her contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the information or services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes the browser application, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Users that reject the cookie may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Links**  
This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware Intrapromote is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Newsletter**   
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we ask for contact information such as name and email address. 

**Surveys**  
Periodically, our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Survey information will be used for purposes of web site monitoring, or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**  
This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and offline. 

**Special Offers**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, press releases, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below. 

**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone. 

**Notification of Changes**   
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users via email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
