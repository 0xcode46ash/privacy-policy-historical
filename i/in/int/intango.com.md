# Entango - Donors & Members

  |  |  **Privacy** **ONLINE DONATION PRIVACY POLICY** **Commitment to Privacy**  
Entango was founded for the purpose of helping not-for-profit organizations ("NPOs") receive online donations inexpensively and efficiently. We, at Entango, understand the concerns that NPOs have with protecting the integrity of donor information. We also understand the concerns donors have with using their credit cards for online transactions. It is therefore in Entango's best interest to protect donors' credit card information in order to provide our customers with the best service possible. We have developed the following Privacy Policy to fulfill our commitment to donor privacy. **Credit Card Numbers**  
When a donor uses Entango-enabled services to make an online donation, the credit card billing information, such as the name on the donor's card, billing address, and expiration date, is used to process the donation. We use SSL, industry standard secure technology, to encrypt donor credit card information. This technology is designed to prevent the theft or interception of the information.

The non profit organization has access to an encrypted version of the donor's credit card number, showing the actual last four digits of the number, and a transaction identification number issued by Entango. Unlike retailers, which commonly keep complete credit card numbers in case there is a billing dispute, Entango only stores encrypted versions of donors' credit card numbers. The NPO normally receives only the encrypted version. However, in a case such as a billing dispute, it may be necessary for the NPO to have access to the actual number. In such a case, Entango will try to help the NPO resolve the billing dispute with only the encrypted number. If that is not possible, Entango will take every precaution available to ensure that the donor's credit card number is released only to authorized employees of the NPO. 

Donating online with Entango will not open your credit card information to dissemination. Entango will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal donors' credit card information used for online donating to third parties, including advertisers or marketers, without first receiving the donor's consent. This information is only used to process the donation. 

**Other Donor Information**

As for the donor's other personally identifiable information, Entango may disclose aggregate use statistics (for example, 50% of our users are male) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, investors, and otherwise relevant third parties, such as non profit industry leaders. Such disclosed information will not include any personal information about individual donors. Other than this statistical use, Entango will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal personal information about individual donors to third parties, without first receiving the donor's consent. EACH NPO MAY HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY THAT DIFFERS FROM ENTANGO'S. PLEASE REFER TO THE NPO FOR ITS OWN PRIVACY POLICY.  
ENTANGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USES OF DONOR INFORMATION BY THE NPO.

 **E-mail Addresses**  
Entango collects the donor's e-mail address to send him or her a confirmation of the transaction for the donor's records. Entango will automatically send updates on information such as transaction activity and password changes as a security measure; personal page access schedules, and other periodic reports unless the donor checks the box on the online donation form requesting not to be sent any such information.

Entango will not disclose, sell, trade, rent, or otherwise reveal donors' e-mail addresses with a third party, other than the NPO receiving the donation. EACH NPO MAY HAVE A PRIVACY POLICY THAT DIFFERS FROM ENTANGO'S. PLEASE REFER TO THE NPO FOR ITS OWN PRIVACY POLICY. ENTANGO IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY USES OF DONOR  
INFORMATION BY THE NPO.

»The Online Donation Privacy Policy outlined above is subject to any legal requirements of disclosure dictated by statute or by an order of an appropriate court of law.
