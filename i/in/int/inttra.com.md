  * [www.inttrachange.com](https://www.inttrachange.com/)



The corporate website resides at [www.inttra.com](https://web.archive.org/en). The product platforms and the corporate website listed here are collectively referred to as the " **Websites** ".

This Privacy Policy applies to all data and information that inttra may obtain about you, in connection with its provision of the inttra systems defined below, including, without limitation, the Websites and transmissions via electronic data interchange (" **EDI** ") (collectively referred to as the " **System** "), and all related services (provision of the System and all related services are collectively referred to as the " **Services** "). This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with one or more agreements between your company (the " **Company** ") and inttra (the " **Agreement(s)** ") that apply to the System and the Services and with any other documents or guides that are provided from time to time in relation to the Services. inttra recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of users of the System (" **Users** ") and this Privacy Policy sets forth inttra's practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of personal data of Users. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal data and how you can access and update this information.

Collection and Use of Personal Data

Your personal data (which includes your name, job title, contact details including business telephone and fax number and e-mail address) may be collected through the System and through e-mail and other correspondence with inttra as well as from third parties, or by any other means, in connection with providing a Service to you on our behalf. We also may collect sensitive information, such as invoice/payment information or tax ID in connection with specific inttra products. We will not share, sell or trade your personal data with third parties for promotional purposes without your consent. We will share your personal data with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy.

inttra and/or its affiliates and third party service providers may use the personal data to:

(a) perform the Services or in connection with the operation of the Services;

(b) monitor and analyze System activity including how the System is used, and the volume and frequency of access, so as to improve the System and the Services;

(c) contact you regarding your inquiries, your use of the System, changes to the System or the Services and to otherwise operate the System;

(d) comply with any applicable law or other legal or regulatory requirements, to respond to a request or subpoena by a government, regulatory or judicial authority, where necessary in connection with a dispute, actual or potential litigation or other legal process or an internal or external audit, or where otherwise necessary to protect the interests of inttra, its affiliates, third party service providers or other participants in the System; and

(e) supplement your personal data with third party sources for background verification.

With your consent, inttra and/or its affiliates may use the personal data to market products and services of inttra and/or its affiliates and third party service providers to your Company through use of post, fax or by e-mail; please note that if inttra sends marketing materials to you we will include a working unsubscribe link so you can unsubscribe.

inttra will also send you Service related e-mail announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if Service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an e-mail. You do not have an option to opt out of these e-mails, which are not promotional in nature.

In addition, any third party offering a service directly to your Company in connection with our Services or on our Websites (including, without limitation, live chat service providers, e-mail service providers and recruiting platforms) (collectively " **Partners** ") may use your personal data to: (a) provide the Services; (b) contact you regarding your inquiries; and (c) market its products and services to your Company through use of post, fax or by e-mail. If you do not want us to share your personal data with these companies, contact us at [service@inttra.com](mailto:service@inttra.com).

Third party personal data may also be entered on our System, such as if your Company has elected to use an administrator to enter the personal data about its users. If this data is collected on our System, it will only be used for the stated purpose for which it was collected.

Disclosure of Personal Data

inttra and/or its affiliates, third party service providers and Partners may disclose your personal data to:

(a) any affiliate, agent or sub-contractor of inttra, and/or its third party service providers or Partners, as applicable, including companies that provide technical services to inttra, such as data processing companies. These companies are authorized to use your personal data only as necessary to provide these Services to us. For the avoidance of doubt, a carrier that is a participant in the System is not considered to be a company that provides technical services to inttra;

(b) any affiliate, agent or sub-contractor of inttra and/or its third party service providers or Partners, as applicable, for the purposes of operating the System and, with your consent, for the marketing and/or provision of third party services. As stated above, all of the third parties offering services through the System may receive your personal data;

(c) any affiliate, agent, sub-contractor or adviser of inttra and/or its third party service providers or Partners, or a government, regulatory or judicial authority, as applicable, in connection with an internal or external audit or examination, a dispute or actual or possible litigation, a request, subpoena or similar legal process, to satisfy a port, state or customs security initiative, or where disclosure is otherwise permitted or required by law;

(d) any affiliate, agent, sub-contractor or adviser of inttra, and/or its third party service providers or Partners, or a participant in the System, or a government, regulatory or judicial authority, as applicable, where necessary to protect the interests of inttra, the public, or other participants in the System, for example, in the event of suspected fraud or illegal activity; and

(e) anyone to whom you authorize inttra to give your personal data, including parties you have authorized to access your personal data in connection with your enrollment as a User and as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy.

In the event that inttra, or any of its assets, are acquired or become the subject of a merger, then your personal data may be transferred with the business or disclosed to potential acquirers or others involved in any such transaction, but shall not otherwise be sold or rented to any third party. You will be notified of this change as described below in "Changes to this Policy".

You acknowledge that inttra is not responsible for information or data in the possession of third parties, except for data processors acting on behalf of inttra, regardless of how such data was obtained. Please consult the privacy policies of these third parties to learn how they may use or disclose your information. You may be contacted directly by an individual carrier. Aggregate or other information not identifiable with any individual may be used or disclosed for other purposes, and to other parties, as deemed appropriate by inttra subject to any obligations of confidentiality under the Agreement(s) and applicable laws.

Data Retention

inttra will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you Services, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our Agreements.

Data Transfers

You consent to inttra, its affiliates, third party service providers and Partners transferring your personal data to inttra, its affiliates and to the recipients referred to in this Privacy Policy in countries outside the European Economic Area (the " **EEA** ") (including the United States of America) which do not provide a similar or adequate level of protection to that provided by countries in the EEA from which you may have submitted your personal data (if applicable).

Security

While no security procedures are fool-proof, inttra maintains industry standard appropriate technical and organizational measures to minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the data transmitted to and from, presented, and stored by inttra. The security of your personal data is important to us. When you log into our System using your User ID and password, we encrypt the collection and transmission of all information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). However, inttra cannot guarantee the security of your personal data during its transmission to inttra. You shall take commercially-reasonable efforts to ensure the secure transfer of all data sent by you across data networks.

inttra's information security measures are designed to:

(a) ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data;

(b) identify potential threats or hazards to the security or integrity of personal data and protect against any anticipated threats or hazards; and

(c) protect against accidental or unauthorized destruction or loss or unauthorized disclosure or access to or use of the personal data.

To access certain parts of the System you will be required to create and maintain a user name and password, which will allow you as a User to access the secure customer section of the System. It is your responsibility to keep your user name and passwords secure and to not share this information with others.
