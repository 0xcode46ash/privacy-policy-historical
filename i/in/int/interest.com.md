  * **Business Partners.** Interest.com may receive your personally identifiable information from one of Interest.com's business partners. 



**Use of Personally Identifiable Information**

Interest.com uses your personally identifiable information to improve and customize the advertising and content you see on Interest.com's Web sites, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and, if you permit Interest.com or Interest.com's affiliates, to contact you about special offers and new products. Your personally identifiable information may also be aggregated and used by Interest.com for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity, to enforce Interest.com's Terms of Use, for other internal purposes, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. Interest.com will obtain your consent for any use of your personally identifiable information beyond the original uses for which you provided your consent. 

You agree that Interest.com may use personal information about you to improve Interest.com's marketing and promotional efforts, analyze site usage, improve Interest.com's content and product offerings, customize www.interest.com's content, layout, and services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. You also agree that Interest.com may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banner advertisements, administrative notices, product offerings, and communications relevant to your use of www.interest.com. By accepting the Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, Interest.com encourages you opt out of the receipt of certain communications, as set forth below. 

**Disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information**

Unless you are entering one of Interest.com's sweepstakes, Interest.com does not currently share, loan, rent or sell your personally identifiable information. However, the following describes some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be disclosed in the normal scope of business to provide Interest.com's services: 

  * **Advertisers.** Interest.com may aggregate personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for their marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, Interest.com does not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your name, email address, password, credit card number, and bank account number, are not disclosed to these third parties in a personally identifiable manner without your explicit consent. 
  * **External Service Providers.** There are a number of separate services offered by third parties, including, without limitation, Interest.com's affiliates, that Interest.com refers to as external service providers that may be complementary to your use of www.interest.com (e.g. realtors, mortgage brokers, lenders, financial institutions, credit card issuers, information aggregators). If you choose to use these separate services, disclose information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permission to collect information about you, then their use of your information is governed by their privacy policy. Interest.com does not disclose your personally identifiable information to external service providers unless you provide your explicit consent. With your consent, Interest.com may provide some of your personal information to the external service provider offering such services, for your convenience. To prevent Interest.com's disclosure of your personally identifiable information to an external service provider, you can decline such consent or simply not use their services. You should evaluate the practices of external services providers before deciding to use their services. 
  * **Internal Service Providers.** Interest.com may use third parties that Interest.com refers to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of Interest.com's business, product and service operations that Interest.com provides to you (e.g., technology, Forums, newsletters/alerts, analytical tools, advertising campaign management) and therefore Interest.com may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers. These internal service providers are subject to confidentiality agreements with Interest.com or other legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information Interest.com provides them for any other purpose except to facilitate the specific outsourced Interest.com related operation, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission to them for additional uses. In some instances, the internal service provider may collect information directly from you. In these cases, you will be notified of the involvement of the internal service provider, and all additional information you provide them and their additional uses will be strictly up to you. If you provide additional information to an internal service provider directly, then their use of your personally identifiable information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. 



Notwithstanding the foregoing, Interest.com reserves the right (and you authorize Interest.com) to share or disclose your personally identifiable information when Interest.com determines, in its sole discretion, that the disclosure of your personally identifiable information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if: 

  * you are or may be violating this Privacy Policy or Interest.com's Terms of Use; 
  * you are interfering with another's rights or property, including, without limitation, Interest.com's rights or property; 
  * you are violating any applicable law, rule or regulation; 
  * necessary or required by any applicable law, rule or regulation; and/or 
  * requested by authorities in the event of any act of terrorism or instance of local, regional or national emergency. 



Personally identifiable information and other personal information collected from you may also be transferred to a third party as a result of a sale, acquisition, merger, reorganization, other transfer or bankruptcy (a "Transfer") involving Interest.com and/or its affiliates. Interest.com specifically reserves the right to transfer personally identifiable information collected from www.interest.com, and any of its databases, together with any personally identifiable information contained therein, to a third party in connection with a Transfer, and nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to interfere with the ability of Interest.com to transfer all or part of its business and/or assets (including www.interest.com) to an affiliate or independent third party at any time, for any purpose, without any limitation whatsoever. 

In addition, due to the existing regulatory environment, Interest.com cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), Interest.com may be forced to disclose personal information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Therefore, although Interest.com uses industry standard practices to protect your privacy, Interest.com does not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable information or private communications will always remain private. 

**NOTE: If you are submitting personally identifiable information pursuant to sweepstakes entry, Interest.com reserves the right to share, loan, rent and/or sell the personally identifiable information that you submit with its affiliates and other third parties. Please refer to the Official Rules and Privacy Policy for each individual sweepstakes for the specific guidelines regarding information sharing and disclosure.**
