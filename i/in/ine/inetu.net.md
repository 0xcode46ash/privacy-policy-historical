All INetU clients are connected to our Client Center. The Client Center has automatic alert functionality that will send you service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if there is a service window for maintenance, we might send you an email.

Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature. Please see "Choice/ Opt-out."

We share personally identifiable information with Third Parties. However, we do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third parties for their promotional purposes.

We provide you the opportunity to "opt-out" of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, when you complete an online inquiry form you have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving our newsletter or any other promotional materials.

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.

We use two third-party tracking services, Google Analytics and Live Person. Both of these use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site.

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site.

We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" file.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice/Opt-out."

We post customer testimonials on our web site which may contain personally identifiable information such as the customer's name. We obtain the customer's consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

In the event INetU goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifiable information will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via email of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
