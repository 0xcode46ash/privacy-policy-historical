This Privacy Policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of information collected through the website, the Client Center Web application owned and operated by INetU and the associated Services we provide for our clients. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. The use of information collected through our Services shall be limited to the purpose of providing the Services for which our Clients have engaged INetU.  
 

##  Information Related To Data Collected Through The INetU Services

INetU collects and processes 3rd party personally identifiable information under the direction of our Clients. We have no ownership of this information or any direct relationship with individuals whose personally identifiable information may be processed as part of providing our Services.

An individual who seeks access to their data, seeks to correct, amend or delete inaccurate data or wishes to opt-out of communications from a INetU Client should direct his/her query to the INetU Client he/she interacts with directly (the data controller). If an INetU Client requests that we remove personally identifiable information on their behalf, we will respond to their request within 30 days.

INetU may transfer personal information to other companies that help us provide our service. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the provisions in this Policy regarding notice and choice and the service agreements with our Clients.

INetU will retain personal data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed to provide services and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Clients who use the services offered on our Site may submit the personal information of other individuals at their organization to register them as authorized users. It is the Client’s obligation, as the data controller, to inform its authorized users about the purposes for which information about them is collected and may be used on this Service. Authorized users can update or remove their account information at any time by logging into the Site and editing their account information, or by contacting their administrator.

These companies are authorized to use your personal information _only as necessary to provide_ these services to us and are contractually obligated to keep your information confidential.

##  Legal Disclaimer
