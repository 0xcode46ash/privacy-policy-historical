# IncrediMail Privacy Policy

IncrediMail takes your online privacy seriously and is committed to providing you with a safe and secure working environment. The IncrediMail team is certainly aware of the ever-growing unethical behavior in today's Internet world and is proud to not participate in any of the offensive business models so commonly used. IncrediMail pledges to you that it will never spam you, force you to install 3rd party software on your system or harm your online privacy in any way. IncrediMail is not a spyware.

Even so, with the increasing amount of spam and spywares flooding the Internet it's difficult not to be skeptical. The following are the most common questions you are likely to ask yourself:

## Does IncrediMail collect any personal information?

When you register with IncrediMail, you will be asked to submit certain information such as your country, age and gender. Only in cases where IncrediMail cannot identify your email account settings, you will be asked to type in information such as your display name, email address and incoming/outgoing server settings. IncrediMail does not collect personally identifiable or non-personally identifiable information other than what is indicated during the registration process.

IncrediMail uses information such as IncrediMail content statistics in order to present users with the "Most Popular" lists in the IncrediMail Online Gallery. We also use the services of a marketing company to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. That way we can meet user preferences, and continuously enhance the IncrediMail product. This is the only kind of non-personally identifiable information used by IncrediMail.

## Is IncrediMail spyware?

**No, it is not.** IncrediMail does not install any PC surveillance tools, capture keystrokes, log your communications, etc. Our business and revenue model has nothing to do with using your personal information in a harmful or deceitful manner. In fact, the IncrediMail team is adamantly against that kind of behavior and therefore, does not violate the privacy policy and agreement with our customers.
