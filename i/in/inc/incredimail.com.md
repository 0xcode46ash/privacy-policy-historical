Even so, with the increasing amount of spam and spywares flooding the Internet it's difficult not to be skeptical. The following are the most common questions you are likely to ask yourself:

_IncrediMail_ uses information such as _IncrediMail_ content statistics in order to present users with the "Most Popular" lists in the _IncrediMail_ Online Gallery. We also use the services of a marketing company to help us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. That way we can meet user preferences, and continuously enhance the _IncrediMail_ product. This is the only kind of non-personally identifiable information used by _IncrediMail_.
