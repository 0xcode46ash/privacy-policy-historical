**Inc. Online On Privacy**

Inc. Online knows you don't want the information you provide us shared indiscriminately. Here, we explain how we collect information, what we do with it, and what controls you have. 

**E-mail Addresses**   
Inc. Online maintains two E-mail databases: the names of people to whom we send the Inc. Online newsletter, and the names of people to whom we send additional information about _Inc._ products. All registration forms throughout the Web site give visitors the option of choosing to be (or not to be) included on each of these lists. We do not collect E-mail addresses from bulletin boards or standard E-mail correspondence we receive. _Inc._ does not sell, trade, or otherwise share these E-mail addresses with outside organizations. Visitors may request to be removed from either list by sending an E-mail to remove@inc.com or online_feedback@inc.com. 

**Postal Addresses**  
The postal addresses provided by visitors when they register with Inc. Online are occasionally used for mailings about _Inc._ products. _Inc._ does not sell, trade, or otherwise share addresses collected by Inc. Online with outside organizations. Visitors may request to be removed from the Inc. Online mailing list by sending an E-mail to [online_feedback@inc.com](mailto:online_feedback@inc.com). 

**Rental of the _Inc._ Magazine Subscriber List**  
_Inc._ 's circulation department maintains its own list of names and addresses of subscribers to the magazine. Occasionally _Inc._ rents these names to outside companies. If you would like your name excluded from these mailings, go to [Subscription Inquiries](https://web.archive.org/about/subscriber_services/inquiries.html) in our Subscriber Services area, fill out your mailing address, then mark "I have an inquiry not listed above," and specify that you do not want your name promoted or sold. 

**Secure Credit-Card Transactions**  
Some Inc. Online products and services require credit-card payment. All online credit-card transactions are done through a Netscape Secure Server using 40-bit SSL; you know you're on a "secure" page when the Web address starts with "https" (the "s" is for "secure"). Your credit-card information is used only to fill your order. 

**Demographic Information**  
Inc. Online's registration form asks visitors to provide optional demographic information about their companies. We use this information in the aggregate for internal analysis and to let advertisers know what kind of businesspeople use our Web site. Individual names and company details are not shared with outside companies. _Inc._ may in the future use this information to better target its mailings about _Inc._ products. 

**Passwords**  
Certain areas of Inc. Online require a password for admittance. Access to the database of password names is limited to a small number of Inc. Online employees. 

**Cookies**  
All visitors to Inc. Online are issued a cookie--a small text file that we place on visitors' hard drives. This controls how often visitors see similar ads, makes sure that once they've registered they're not asked to register again, and allows visitors to use the Customize Your View feature. 

Because almost all areas of Inc. Online are free and since most of our site's revenues come from advertising, the use of cookies to help manage our advertising system is crucial to us. We need cookies to monitor some of the information--such as how often ads are displayed to individual users--that keeps us in business. 

You may seem to get a lot of cookies when you come to our site. That's because the software we use to track our ads, NetGravity, attempts to send a single cookie to a user until that user accepts it. If the user keeps refusing, NetGravity will continue to try. 

Many of the fears people have about cookies are unfounded. If you don't specifically _tell_ a Web site your name or address, the site won't be able to find them through the cookie. Cookies are specific to the server that created them and _cannot_ be accessed by other servers--which means they can't be used to track your movements around the Web. They don't crash computers and they don't cause viruses. And cookies aren't forever: you can easily ditch any or all by going into your cookie file on your hard drive. Here's how: If you're on a PC and using Netscape, search for cookie.txt; from Internet Explorer, go to Preferences and under Receiving Files choose Cookies. You can then toss any or all of your cookies with impunity. 

**IP Addresses**  
Inc. Online logs the IP addresses of its visitors for internal analysis. 

**. . . And a Few Final Things**  


* In several clearly-marked places, Inc. Online has partnered with outside companies to provide visitors with direct access to these companies' services. Information you give these companies may be used by them in ways that are different from Inc. Online's policies; please review these companies' privacy practices if you are concerned. 
* Marketers sometimes collect and use E-mail addresses that are posted by visitors at public forums such as the Inc. Online bulletin boards and Inc. Online's Create Your Own Web Site area. We can not control this. 
* Marketers who are unaffiliated with either Inc. Online or its parent company, Goldhirsh Group, Inc., sometimes send out E-mails that falsely claim to have an _Inc._ return E-mail address. [Click here](https://web.archive.org/about/email.html) for more on our efforts against misuse of our E-mail address. 

  
**Inc. Online** works hard to maintain the trust we've built with our loyal customers and users. Please E-mail any questions, concerns, or comments you have about these policies to [online_feedback@inc.com](mailto:online_feedback@inc.com). 

The Inc. Online Web site and databases are maintained by the staff of Inc. Online and Goldhirsh Group, Inc. at offices in Boston and New York.

The following explains how __ inc.com collects information from you and what we do with it.

**

Information Requests

**

You will need to register with inc.com™ in order to visit certain areas on the site and will be asked to provide your E-mail address if you wish to receive newsletters. You will also be asked for your E-mail address and other identifying information if you wish either to make purchases from inc.com or to contact any Solutions Provider. In addition, you will be asked for information that proves you are a subscriber to Inc. magazine if you wish to gain access through the site to the latest issue of the magazine.

Inc.com may, unless you indicate otherwise, use member E-mail addresses to send additional information and product promotions. Inc.com also shares registration information with Solutions Providers and, in turn, receives information from them on transactions which you enter into with them. This information may be used to identify users to whom inc.com sends additional information and product promotions. Inc.com does not otherwise provide the identifying information we collect from you to third parties.

Inc.com does not collect E-mail addresses of visitors to bulletin boards, from those who create BizCards, from those who correspond with us through E-mail, or from inc.com-hosted Web sites. Marketers unaffiliated with inc.com often collect E-mail addresses of those who choose to participate in public forums hosted by inc.com of those who create BizCards, but inc.com cannot control their doing so.

Inc.com does collect information in aggregate form that we may provide to advertisers and others. If and when this is done, inc.com will not include any identifiable individual information. This compilation of data may be used for various internal business purposes and may be made available to members in the _Smart Statements_ they may receive. 

**_

Credit Card Transactions

_**

If you use your credit card to purchase products or services from inc.com, the transactions will be carried out through a secure server using 40-bit SSL. You will be able to tell that you are using a secure server for the transaction because the web address will begin with "https" (the added "s" indicates that the transaction is secure). Your credit card information will be used by us only to complete the transaction.

**_

Cookies

_**

All visitors to inc.com are issued a "cookie"—a small text file that inc.com places on your hard drive in order to prevent your repeatedly seeing the same ads or being asked to register more than once. Cookies are also used to authenticate your identity. We have asked Solutions Providers to issue a cookie to visitors who have been referred to them through the inc.com site. This will allow you to be recognized as an inc.com customer and enable each Solution Provider to monitor its transactions with inc.com customers and report that information to us.

A cookie is specific to the server that delivered it and cannot be used by others to track your activities on the web. No cookie delivered by inc.com will interfere with the operation of your computer.
