We will use information in accordance with the Privacy Policy under which the information was collected.

### Customer Proprietary Network Information Notice

This information regarding Customer Proprietary Network Information, or CPNI, is provided in accordance with federal regulations that require telecommunications carriers to provide notice concerning a carrier’s use of CPNI.

CPNI is the information that inContact gathers about its customers 1) that relates to the quantity, technical configuration, type, destination, and amount of use of telecommunications services subscribed to by its customers, and that is made available to inContact by the customer solely by virtue of the carrier-customer relationship; and 2) information contained in the bills pertaining to telephone exchange service or telephone toll service received by a customer of a carrier. CPNI does not include subscriber list information.

### Customer Privacy

inContact offers various communications-related services, including local and long distance service, and telecommunications equipment. In order to better serve your communication needs, from time to time we would like to share your CPNI across product lines within inContact. inContact would also like to share your CPNI on a limited, as-needed basis with trusted agents and independent contractors that assist inContact in providing you with communication-related services. These parties share a duty to protect your CPNI. Our use of CPNI may enhance our ability to offer products and services tailored to your specific needs. inContact will not sell your CPNI to third parties, or otherwise disclose your CPNI to third parties unless required to do so by operation of law.

### Customer Rights

In the normal course of providing services to its users and customers, inContact collects and maintains certain customer proprietary network information (“CPNI”). CPNI includes the types of telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services Customer currently purchases or subscribes to, how Customer uses those services (for example, Customer’s calling records), and billing information related to those services. Customer’s telephone number, name, and address do not constitute CPNI.

inContact does not sell, trade, or otherwise share Customer’s CPNI with anyone outside of inContact and those parties authorized to represent inContact to offer inContact’s services or to perform functions on inContact’s behalf related to inContact’s services, except as the law may require or Customer may authorize.  

Federal law generally permits inContact to use CPNI in providing telecommunications and interconnected VoIP services to Customer, including billing and collections for those services.  inContact is also permitted to use or disclose CPNI to offer Customer communications services of the same type that Customer already purchases from inContact.  inContact may also use or disclose Customer CPNI for legal or regulatory reasons such as to respond to a court order, to investigate fraud, to protect inContact’s rights or property, to protect against the unlawful use of inContact’s services, or to protect other users.

### How to Contact Us to Opt-Out

Customer may elect to prohibit inContact’s use of Customer’s CPNI to market services other than services of the same type that Customer already purchases from inContact by providing inContact with Customer’s “opt-out” notice within thirty (30)  calendar days of Customer’s Service commencement.  If you wish to opt out or change your previous CPNI opt-out selection, please state your preference in writing to inContact at the following address:

inContact, Inc.  
Kimm Partridge  
Corporate Secretary  
7730 S. Union Park Ave, Suite 500  
Midvale, UT 84047.   

Customer must include the following information in an opt-out request:  Name, account number, contact phone number, billing address and a clear statement that Customer would like to opt out of inContact marketing campaigns for services other than the type Customer already purchases from inContact.  If Customer fails to opt out in writing within such timeframe, Customer will be deemed to have given inContact consent to use Customer’s CPNI to market services other than services of the same type that Customer already purchases from inContact.  Restricting inContact’s use of Customer CPNI will not affect inContact’s provision of any service, nor will it necessarily eliminate all types of inContact marketing.
