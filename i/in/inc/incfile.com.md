Privacy Policy

We at IncFile.com, LLC have designed our business practices to safeguard your privacy. This privacy policy applies to your information that we collect and receive; it does not apply to practices of businesses that we do not own or control or to people we do not employ. Therefore, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other businesses.

You can visit IncFile.com, LLC without revealing who you are or providing any personal information about yourself. By using this site, you agree to the terms of this privacy policy.

There will be times, such as when you communicate with us by e-mail, submit an application, request a quote, purchase a product, etc., when we will need to obtain personally identifiable information from you or about you. Such personally identifiable information may include your name, home address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number, financial information, credit references, etc. The information we receive about you or from you may be used by us or shared (including evaluating and obtaining financial products or services) by us with our corporate affiliates, agents, vendors and other third parties to help process your request or complete a transaction; to comply with any law, regulation, audit or court order; to help improve our website or the products or services we offer; for research; to better understand our customers' needs; to develop new offerings; and to alert you to new products and services (of us or our business associates) in which you may be interested. We may also combine information you provide us with information about you that is available to us internally or from other sources. We believe that knowing more about you can enable us to serve you better. 

You should be aware that we do not collect usage information about you when you visit our site, and we do not use "cookies."

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on applications on our website or other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and 
  * Information about you we may receive from credit reporting agencies.



We safeguard your personal data (e.g., credit card and finance application information) during electronic transmission from you to us using known encryption, security standards and procedures. We restrict access to non-public personal information about you only to those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and other procedural safeguards to comply with applicable privacy laws to guard your nonpublic personal information. We also assess new technology for protecting sensitive customer information on an ongoing basis. However, if your information is forwarded to a dealership or other third party provider, your information will be transmitted according to the security and privacy policies of that dealership or third party provider whose privacy practices may differ from ours. Your information as shared with outside providers will become subject to those different privacy policies. 

Please be aware that we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time. If we do, we will update this Privacy Policy at our website, so be sure to check back here frequently.
