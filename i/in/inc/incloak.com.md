# Privacy Policy

We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information.

Any personal information received will only be used to fill your order. We will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone.

To maximize your privacy we collect the minimum information required, and that is your email address. We do not request or store your name, IP address, physical addresses, phone number or any other personal information. Payments are processed by outsourced payment processor (e.g. Paymentwall or Gate2Shop) and we are not saving any details about the payments in our system.

inCloak uses Google Analytics to analyze in aggregate information about our website visitors. When your web browser loads a page on our site, a small snippet of javascript code is executed within your browser which submits information about the device from which you are connecting such as your browser user-agent, language, screen resolution, referring website, etc. to the Google Analytics service. To enhance your anonymity, inCloak have opted to only allow Google to collect only a portion of the IP address. Google Analytics may also store a web cookie to facilitate the identification of users who revisit the site. If users are concerned with being tracked by Google analytics scripts on inCloak or any other site running Google analytics, we recommend installing a [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout) which allows you to opt out.
