# Incredibox - Privacy

Last update on 18th june 2018

At [So Far So Good](http://www.sofarsogood.fr/), the French company behind Incredibox, we take privacy seriously.  
This policy is designed to let you know clearly what information we may collect and how we use it. We may change or update those Privacy Policy at any time. If you don’t agree with this Privacy Policy, just don’t use our site and services. If you have any questions please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20180903165658id_/https%3A//www.incredibox.com/info/form), we'll be happy to answer you! 

## __   General Privacy

Firstly let see what kind of informations may be collected. There are two types of data that we may collect:

• The first one is called **personal data**. This is personally identifiable information that identifies a user as an individual. For example it could be your email, your name, your phone number, your IP address, etc.

• The second type is **non personal data** which doesn’t directly identify an individual. For example it could be your age, your gender, your interests, your device type, your browser type, your language, your country, etc.

Please note that Incredibox exists technically under two different forms: the website and the mobile app (iOS and Android). Incredibox on the website can be played from a desktop browser, while the Incredibox mobile app can be played only on mobile and tablet devices. Depending on what you are using (browser version vs mobile app), we don’t collect same datas on both website and mobile app. 

Whatever, remember that if we need to collect some of your datas, it's first of all to improve our game and to ensure the proper functioning of the technical part of Incredibox. Our goal is above all to entertain you by offering you the best possible experience.
