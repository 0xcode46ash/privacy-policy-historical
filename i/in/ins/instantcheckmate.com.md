We may automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers accessing the Site; and (4) types of web browsers used to access the Site (collectively "Traffic Data"). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for improving your experience on the Site.

#### ii. Uses of Information Collected

We may use your Personal Information to send you information about our company and our products or services or to contact you when necessary. We may also share your Personal Information with our partners who may contact you about goods and services they offer. We use your Financial Data only to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services. We do not use your Financial Data for any other purpose.

#### iii. Cookies and Web Beacons

Cookies and web beacons are small text files that are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. Instant Checkmate collects information through cookies and web beacons about your web browsing activities such as the address of the page you are visiting, the address of the referrer page you previously visited, the time you are viewing the page, your browsing environment, and your display settings. We may use cookies and web beacons on our Site for the following purposes:

  * Understanding traffic patterns and the number of visitors to the Site and other websites that we partner with;
  * Understanding how you use and interact with the Site;
  * Improving Instant Checkmate products and services;
  * Optimizing your experience on the Site;
  * Providing anonymous individual or aggregate auditing, research, modeling, and reporting for our advertisers and other partners;
  * Storing your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Site;
  * Providing you with relevant advertising and content; and
  * Managing our Site.



Please note that cookies may be placed by a third party service provider who performs these functions for us. These third parties may have their own privacy policies.

#### iv. Sharing of Personal Information

We may share Personal Information with advertisers and other third parties. The other parties with whom we share Personal Information may send information to you about products or services. We do not share your Financial Data with these third parties. We may share Financial Data with business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Site. Those business partners agree to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality described in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Financial Data to carry out their specific business obligations to Instant Checkmate.

#### v. Internet Based Ads

We may also share Traffic Data with advertisers and other third parties who may use it for advertising purposes, including to serve targeted advertising on non-affiliated third party sites. Some of those ads may be personalized, meaning that they are intended to be relevant to you based on information about your online activities on the Site or other websites over time. For example, anonymous information collected across multiple sites may enable the ad network to predict your preferences and show you ads that are likely to be of interest to you. Please note that we do not share any information that identifies you personally with the third party service providers who serve ads on our behalf. To opt out of these types of ads, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative for information about how to opt-out of interest-based advertising by their members. See [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) for general information about the NAI and <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp> for the opt-out page. You may also visit <http://www.aboutads.info/consumers/> to learn about interest based advertising and how to opt-out from online behavioral ads served by some or all participating companies.

If we or some or all of our assets are acquired by another company, including through a sale in connection with a bankruptcy, that company will possess the information collected by us, and it will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy.

We may disclose Personal Information or other data to comply with law or legal requirements, enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements, or protect our rights, property, the safety of our users, or others.
