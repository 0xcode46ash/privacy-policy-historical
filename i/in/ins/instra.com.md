## WHOIS Policy

The public WHOIS service is a standard feature of domain name systems around the world. The purpose of the WHOIS service is to allow users to query a domain name to find out the identity and contact details of the registrant. The WHOIS service is provided by the registry via a web-based tool and Port 43. 

  1. Collection of WHOIS Data 
    1. Data about each domain name registration is collected from the registrant by the registrar, and submitted to the registry in accordance with the procedural requirements of the registry. The WHOIS service displays a subset of the full registry data for each domain name (known as the "WHOIS data"). 
    2. Under the Registrar Agreement, and in accordance with Australian privacy legislation, registrars must inform registrants of the fact that some of their personal information will be disclosed on the WHOIS service. Under the domain name licence agreement, registrants grant to the registry the right to disclose information for the purposes of maintaining the WHOIS service. 
    3. Due to the policy requirements in the .au domain, the WHOIS data that is collected by registrars at the time of registration is highly accurate and reliable. However, the integrity of the WHOIS database is undermined if the data is not kept up-to-date. 
    4. In order to maintain the integrity of the WHOIS database, registrants are required to notify their registrar of any changes to WHOIS data for their domain name(s) and the registrar must update the WHOIS database on receipt of new information from the registrant. 
  2. Disclosure of WHOIS Data 
    1. The table in [Schedule A](http://domaindirectors.com.au/policies/scheduleAtable.pdf) lists the data fields that will be disclosed on the WHOIS service (web-based and Port 43) for all domain names in the open 2LDs. 
    2. In order to comply with Australian privacy legislation, the street address, telephone and facsimile numbers of registrants will not be disclosed. 
    3. It is necessary for the WHOIS data to include a contact email address for the registrant, for the purpose of contacting the registrant in relation to their domain name. The registrant does not have to nominate their own personal email address, but they must nominate an email address at which they can be contacted. 
    4. To address user concerns about privacy and spam, and in line with international best practice, auDA has implemented Image Verification Check (IVC) on the web-based WHOIS service. The purpose of IVC is to prevent or hinder unauthorised access to WHOIS data by automated data mining programs or scripts. For consistency, auDA has removed all email addresses from Port 43 WHOIS responses; users of Port 43 WHOIS will be referred to the web-based WHOIS service to access email addresses via IVC. 
    5. In the past, it was possible to use WHOIS to find out the creation and/or expiry date of a domain name. This enabled some members of the domain name industry to send unsolicited renewal notices to registrants with whom they did not have a prior business relationship, causing significant levels of customer confusion. As a result of these problems, auDA has determined that creation, renewal and expiry dates will not be disclosed on the WHOIS service. Registrants who wish to check the creation, renewal or expiry date of their own domain name can do so through their registrar or reseller. 
  3. Use of WHOIS Data 

In the interests of protecting the privacy of registrants, the following activities are strictly prohibited:

    1. use of WHOIS data to allow, enable or otherwise support the transmission of unsolicited communications to any person, by any means;
    2. use of WHOIS data to support an automated electronic query process; and
    3. bulk access to WHOIS data (ie. where a user is able to access WHOIS data other than by sending individual queries to the database).
