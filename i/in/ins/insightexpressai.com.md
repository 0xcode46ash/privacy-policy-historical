# Privacy Statement

  
InsightExpress, LLC (http://www.InsightExpress.com) abides by the principles set forth in the Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union. InsightExpress is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

Privacy Overview  
InsightExpress (http://www.InsightExpress.com) believes in and respects your privacy and the sanctity of information that may be provided. Further, as members of the ARF and CASRO, the North America associations of market research professionals, and the Mobile Marketing Association, the global association of the mobile marketing industry, we believe the use of information should be outlined for you as we have done so below. Additionally, InsightExpress is in compliance with HIPPA and COPPA privacy guidelines. InsightExpress is committed to respecting your privacy.

The information we collect is typically used in aggregate form to help companies understand marketplace needs as well as to create and deliver better products and services. We do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information.

The effective date for this Privacy Policy is September 24, 2009. 

Personal Information  
In the course of responding to our surveys or using our service, you may have the opportunity to voluntarily submit personally identifiable information (e.g., providing profile information, e-mail address or mobile phone number). InsightExpress maintains this information in a database, and may use this information to invite you to participate in future surveys, subject to agreement with the authoring and the respondent-providing client and your explicit opt-in to receive e-mail or mobile communications. Your decision to participate in future surveys is completely at your discretion. That is, you have no obligation to complete this or any future survey. By participating in a survey or in visiting our Web site, you understand and consent to this policy. 

Notice to Children and Young People  
InsightExpress does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. 

Notice regarding health related topics/surveys   
Because facts about a persons demographic, health, health interest, and health care are private and sensitive, we know that you may have concerns about sharing information with us. This Privacy statement is designed to answer your important questions about privacy.

Contests  
Periodically we request information (typically e-mail address, mobile phone number or your mailing address if needed to mail a prize to you) from users to participate in contests. Contest participation is completely voluntary and users may choose whether or not to disclose this information. Your e-mail, mobile phone number or mailing address may be shared with the survey sponsor to notify winner(s) and award prizes. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give users notice and choice. Although we may use an intermediary to conduct contests, they may not employ users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose. 

Use of Cookies  
To invite you to participate in surveys that may be of great interest to you and to enable you to use our service, we use "cookies" and local shared objects ("Flash Cookies"). "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer, and are commonly used by most Web sites to provide you with an enhanced experience. Our cookies do not contain any personally identifying information, but they enable us to understand the surveys you may have taken. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to inform you or prevent the use of cookies. If you do not accept cookies, you may not be able, depending upon the individual survey, to complete more than the first set of questions in a survey or to use our service to create surveys. 

Log Files  
Like most Web sites, we log the use of our service. This includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks in order to administer the site, track aggregate movement, analyze trends, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. This information is not linked to personally identifiable information. 

Order Form  
If you create surveys using our service, we request information from users who purchase our services via an order form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail address, and shipping address, etc.) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date, etc.). This information is only used for billing purposes and to fill users' requests. If we have trouble processing an order, this information may be used to contact the user. 

Third-Party Intermediary  
If you create surveys using our service, we use a third-party credit card processing company to bill users for services they purchase when they use a credit card. We share the user's name, credit card number, and billing address with this third party only to execute the transaction. This third party only uses this information to conduct the transaction, and it does not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purpose. 

Security  
We take every precaution to protect our users' information. When our users enter sensitive information (such as credit card information), that information is protected using SSL encryption. While on a secure page (such as our Order Form) the lock icon on the bottom of most Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. Users who have any questions about the security at our Web site are encouraged to contact us as indicated below. 

Confidentiality  
We are sensitive to the privacy and security of your personal information. However, we cannot guarantee absolute security as such information may be transmitted using the Internet, other public telecommunication networks, servers, hardware or software ("systems") that are not owned, operated, or controlled by us. 

Legal Disclaimer  
Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served to us. 

Communications  
Below are the instances when users may receive e-mail communications from our site. 

  * _Newsletters_  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we request an e-mail address. Out of respect for our users' privacy, we enable subscribers to opt-out of these communications by following the Opting-Out practices outlined below.   

  * _Survey Invitations_  
If a user wishes to participate in future surveys, we may request an e-mail address. Out of respect for our users' privacy, we also enable users to opt-out of future survey invitations by following the Opting-Out practices outlined below.   

  * _Service Announcements_  
On rare occasions it may be necessary to issue a service related announcement (for instance, if our service is undergoing maintenance). These communications are not promotional in nature and users may not opt-out of these communications (although users can deactivate their account).   

  * _Customer Service Communications_  
At a user's request, we may communicate via e-mail, chat, or telephone to answer service-related questions. E-mails and/or chats transcripts may be maintained by InsightExpress to provide assistance in resolving any inquiries. 

Opt-Out Policy  
Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter, promotional communications, or survey invitations may opt-out by replying to any received e-mail with "remove" or "unsubscribe" in the subject line, for mobile phone communications, reply with stop to the message or by contacting us as indicated below. 

Maintaining, Updating, Deleting, or Deactivating Personal Information  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by e-mailing Customer Support at [support@insightexpress.com](mailto:support@insightexpress.com) or by visiting <https://www.insightexpress.com/ix/billinginfo.asp>. We may also be reached using the contact information below. InsightExpress will respond to any access request provided within 30 days of submitting the request.

Links  
This Web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we, InsightExpress, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site which includes any co-branded InsightExpress Web sites. 

Notification of Privacy Policy Changes  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post notification of those changes to this privacy statement on the homepage so users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner materially different from that stated at the time of collection, we will notify users via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/ deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also e-mail users who have opted to receive communications notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices.
