# InstallShield Software Corporation: Leading Installation Development Tools

This statement discloses the privacy practices for InstallShield Software Corporation, hereafter referred to as InstallShield. 

In this document, you will find information on: 

  * Visitor information collected on InstallShield.com 
  * How the information is used 
  * Visitors' control of their information 
  * Relevant other topics: cookies, security measures, and protection of credit card data 

**Visitor information collected on InstallShield.com**  
For each visitor to our site, our Web server automatically attempts to collect general, non-personally identifiable information. Examples of this type of information include the visitor's domain name, which pages the user visits, and from which site he/she came. 

On certain pages of the site, including software evaluation downloads and product support requests, the user will be prompted to enter information into an online form. Although the site itself does not store this information (via cookie or otherwise), the information is eventually transferred to a customer management database not directly linked to our Web site systems. 

On pages that include online ordering, billing information will be collected to process the order. InstallShield will ask visitors to re-enter this information every time they visit the site, as the company does not save it with personally identifiable information for security reasons. 

**How the information is used**  
Information generated from our Web site may be used as aggregate data or to identify individual users or segments of users. In general, InstallShield uses information generated from user activities on the site to: 

  * Give users notification of changes or updates to company products, services, or support 
  * Identify demographics of users 
  * Identify overall site user-ship patterns 



InstallShield will not release, sell, barter, or trade any individual or personal information you provide to us to any entities or individuals outside of InstallShield or authorized InstallShield partners and resellers, except in aggregate (anonymous) form. When information is provided in aggregate form, all identifiers are stripped out first. Certain affiliates, as a condition of transacting the business of InstallShield, will be provided with user information if necessary. 

Credit card information is never used by InstallShield for purposes other than processing an order nor shared with any outside party. All credit card information is purged from the company database immediately following the transaction of any business that may require this information. 

**Visitor's control of their information**

InstallShield or one of our InstallShield authorized partners or resellers may choose to send users information, such as product updates at any time. Should users wish not to be included in e-mail subscriptions, they must contact the company directly by phone or by visiting www.installshield.com/news/unsubscribe.asp. 

**Relevant other topics: cookies, security measures, and protection of credit card data**  
The InstallShield corporate Web site does not currently use cookies, but it may elect to do so at anytime. For your information, cookies are very small text files, usually just a few lines, so they will have minimal impact on hard drive space. Cookies are non-executable files; therefore known viruses cannot be run from them. 

InstallShield values the security of the information you submit. The company has taken steps to ensure the security of the personally identifiable data and ordering information you submit by encrypting each sensitive transmission with secure socket layer (SSL) technology. 

InstallShield encrypts, with 128-bit SSL, each transaction that involves credit card information. After processing every order, the system purges this sensitive financial information to maintain the customer's privacy. This information is neither used by InstallShield for purposes other than completing your order nor shared with any outside party. 

This site contains links to outside resources and InstallShield is not responsible for the privacy practices of these external sites. 

**Updates**  
The InstallShield privacy policies are subject to change without notice. Changes to these policies will be reflected in this statement.

InstallShield appreciates your feedback on this privacy statement and the policies it reflects. The following information can be used to contact the company with any questions or comments pertaining to these practices:
