**[HOME](https://web.archive.org/default.asp) > PRIVACY POLICY**   
We are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of users of INSIDE.com. This policy statement tells you how we collect information from you and how we use it. Using the Internet should be a fun and informative experience and we want to help you make it so. 

The information you provide for your personal INSIDE account is used to make your visits to our site easy and enjoyable. Be assured that INSIDE will not disclose your personal information to third parties without your consent, except in aggregated form, as explained below. However, INSIDE reserves the right to disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) INSIDE's rights or property, other users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. INSIDE also reserves the right to disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. 

INSIDE collects and shares aggregate information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. For example, we will say INSIDE's audience is X percent females and Y percent males. This data is used to customize INSIDE's content and advertising to deliver a better experience for our users and will in no way personally identify you. 

There are cases where we may ask you for personal information such as your name, email address, and birth date. For example, we request personal information when you register for an INSIDE account, for transactions, or for services that require registration or subscription. INSIDE needs to collect this information for fulfilling services, tracking/verifying compliance with INSIDE policies and applicable law and/or for purposes of editorial content and decisions. In addition, we may request your credit card information to bill you for membership fees or other services or products offered for sale through INSIDE or certain third party vendors. We may provide this credit card information to such third party vendors if necessary to complete your requested transaction. 

Furthermore, we may use your personal information to send you periodic communications, solicit your feedback, provide you with special offers, or for other purposes and to customize the services we provide to you. If you choose to opt out of receiving any communications from us, please so indicate in Step Two of the registration process, or simply reply as indicated in any e-mails we send to you. 

In case you choose to delete or change some of the information you have provided to us, you can do so at the member information page or by visiting our [Help Center](https://web.archive.org/support/index.html). 

**Use of IP Address**  
An IP address is a number that's automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the Web. Web servers -- the big computers that "serve up" Web pages -- automatically identify your computer by its IP address. 

INSIDE collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When guests request pages from INSIDE, our servers log the guests' IP addresses. It is not our practice to link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user's session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to us. However, we reserve the right to use IP addresses to identify a user only when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, customers or others. Some services within INSIDE, such as certain message boards, may display IP addresses and/or e-mail addresses along with the message poster's name and message. 

**Use of Cookies  
** What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make Web-surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're at our site. We never save passwords or credit card information in cookies. The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use a site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users' needs. 

INSIDE has two primary uses for its cookies. First, we use them to specify unique preferences. For example, in the registration process, users can specify their affinity to specific areas of content. This way you don't have to tell us over and over again about the kinds of news stories you want to see. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns. This helps us better understand and improve areas of INSIDE's service that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a "cookie," visitors to INSIDE always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. 

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that many parts of the INSIDE service will not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, without cookies, you will not be able to set personalized news preferences or you may have difficulty completing transactions, entering contests, or playing games. 

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. INSIDE does not control these cookies. The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. 

**Links to Other Sites/ "Public" Areas  
** Users should be aware that when you are on INSIDE, you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from INSIDE pages that take you outside our service. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data or solicit personal information. The privacy policies of these other sites may significantly differ from that of INSIDE. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and cannot guarantee the security of any of your personal information collected there. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information on a "public" venue online --- for example, via message boards or chat --- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. If you choose to voluntarily disclose information on a bulletin board, message board or chat room on our Web site, this Privacy Policy will not cover such disclosure of information. We urge you to use caution when disclosing any private information on these venues. 

**Security  
** Protecting the security of all personally identifiable information associated with our guests is of utmost concern to us. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your PC to our servers. Once we receive your transmission, we will take reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems. When credit card information is transmitted we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while INSIDE strives to protect its users' personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your personal information. 

Your INSIDE Account is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. In registering for the INSIDE services, you agreed not to divulge your password to anyone. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. 

Remember to sign out of your INSIDE account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This will ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet caf√©. 

**Privacy Policy for Minors  
** INSIDE does not knowingly collect information from minors. If you are under 18, please do not provide any personal information to us. **Your Acceptance of These Terms  
** By using this site, you signify your assent to the INSIDE Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. The terms of this Privacy Policy may change from time to time without prior notice to you, so please check this page periodically for any changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. **Questions  
** [E-mail us](mailto:customercare@inside.com) with any questions that you may have regarding this Privacy Policy. |  |
