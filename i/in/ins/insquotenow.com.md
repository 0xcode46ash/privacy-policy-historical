### 1\. Who We Are and What We Do

[INSQUOTENOW.COM](https://web.archive.org/) is a leading online marketplace connecting consumers with insurance Agents to compete for their business across a variety of insurance policy types. [INSQUOTENOW.COM](https://web.archive.org/) is not an insurance agency and does not provide quotes directly to consumers. Rather, [INSQUOTENOW.COM](https://web.archive.org/) is a free matching service that instantly connects you with our nationwide network of quality insurance Agents

After you submit your quote request via our web site, [INSQUOTENOW.COM](https://web.archive.org/) immediately matches you to local and national Agents who can meet your insurance needs. We create this connection by emailing you the list of matching Agents and their contact information as well as passing your information to the Agents. Your matching Agents will use the information you provided in your quote request to run your quote and contact you with the details. Sometimes, [INSQUOTENOW.COM](https://web.archive.org/) does not have a matching Agent based on your location and insurance needs. In this event, your information may be passed to one of our partner companies to ensure that you receive as many competitive quotes as possible.

### 3\. How Your Information is Used
