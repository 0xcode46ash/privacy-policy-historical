 **  Information Collection and Use**  
  
InsideWorld is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. InsideWorld collects information from our users at several different points in our network of websites.  
   
  
 **  Registration**  
  
In order to use certain features of [http://www.InsideWorld.com](http://www.insideworld.com/), a user must first complete the registration form.  During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address).  This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. The on-line registration form also requires that the user provide demographic information (such as nationality and gender), so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.  
   
  
  **Order**  
  
Currently none of InsideWorld’s sites feature on-line purchase forms. If such forms are introduced in the future, our information practice will be governed by the following.

We request information from the user on our order form.  Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date).  This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer’s orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.  
   
  
 **  Cookies**  
  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Since cookies are stored on the user’s hard drive, not on our site, the user may at any time examine the data files and see what information is being recorded. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.  The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site and some features may not function properly. 

We also use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g. to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.  
   
  
 **  Log Files**  
  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  
   
  
 **  Sharing**  
  
We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We may partner with another party to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names, or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.  
   
  
  **Links**  
  
[http://www.InsideWorld.com](http://www.insideworld.com/) and derivative sites contain links to other sites. Please be aware that InsideWorld is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.  This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by InsideWorld’s Web sites.   
   
  
 **  News Letter**  
  
If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name, email address and other information, including possible demographic information.  
   
  
 **  Surveys & Contests**  
  
From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level).  Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes.  Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.   
   
  
 **  Tell-A-Friend/Post Cards**  
  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site or to send an electronic post card, we ask them for the name and email address of the third party. InsideWorld will automatically send that party a one-time email with directions.  InsideWorld stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email.  
   
  
 **  Security**  
  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

Currently, no forms are on-line that require sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number). May the need arise that such information be transmitted, the following procedure will be used.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL.  While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, follow this link to [www.ssl.org](http://www.ssl.org/) or [www.apache-ssl.org.](http://www.apache-ssl.org./)

Currently, data collected through registration and other means is not treated as sensitive and is not done through a secured page and the lock icon will remain open. However, we do everything in our power to protect user-information. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.  In such event, access to your information is password protected.  Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@InsideWorld.com](mailto:security@InsideWorld.com).  
   
  
 **  Supplementation of Information**  
  
In order for this website to enhance its ability to tailor the site to an individual’s preference, we may combine information about the purchasing habits of users with similar information from our partners to create a personalized user profile.   
   
  
  **Special Offers**  
  
We may send a new member a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Such information may come directly from InsideWorld or from third parties. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out below.  
   
  
 **  Site and Service Updates**  
  
We also send the user site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to un-subscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.  
   
  
 **  Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
  
If a user’s personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us.  
  
 **  Choice/Opt-out**  
  
Our users are given the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information.  For example, our subscription form has an ‘opt-out’ mechanism so users who subscribe to a news service from us, but don’t want any marketing material, can keep their email address off of our lists.

Users may unsubscribe from any InsideWorld news service by accessing their account page at [http://www.InsideWorld.com/members/index.shtml](http://www.insideworld.com/members/index.shtml).  Username and password are required.

Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties.  We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that require an outside party, or not.  
   
  
 **  Notification of Changes**  
  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, then we will notify users by way of an email.  Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
