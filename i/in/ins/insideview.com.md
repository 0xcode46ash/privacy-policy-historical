**1) Information We Collect for Our Database**

**Information We Collect**

InsideView develops and maintains a database (the “Database”) of company and individual profiles (“Profiles”).

Information collected for the development of an individual Profile and/or published in an individual Profile on the InsideView Service may include: name, title, company, current position, prior position, salary, publications, articles by, about, or quoting an individual, links to social media postings by or about the individual, professional contact information and similar information.

Information collected for the development of a company Profile and/or published in a company Profile on InsideView may include: the name and title of the company’s officers and certain company employees, information obtained from the company or published by third parties.

**Our Sources of Information**

InsideView collects information about individuals and companies from a variety of publicly available and other sources, such as company websites, company blogs, non-confidential corporate records or reports (for example, SEC filings), press releases, news articles, magazines, social media sites, and other content published by or on behalf a company or published by data brokers or third parties in accordance with their terms and conditions for the collection, disclosure and sharing of information.

InsideView also collects information about individuals and companies from government publications in accordance with their terms and conditions for the disclosure and sharing of information.

InsideView may also receive some Information directly from the individual or company whose Profile is featured in our Database.

Finally, subscribers and other third parties who know facts about a particular individual or company may contribute some information to our Database about that individual (name, title, email, phone, social profile link (Facebook and Twitter)) or company (name, URL, address, phone, industry, revenue, employee count) if they desire.

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

This information collected as described above is then compiled, edited and organized through InsideView’s unique proprietary CRM Intelligence application in order to create a Profile for each individual or company

Each individual or company Profile is integrated into the InsideView Database, which is part of the InsideView Service. Subscribers of the InsideView Service have access to the Database and the Profiles and, as such, may conduct searches and save the identified Profiles meeting their search criteria for their own internal purposes. Subscribers may also contact individuals or companies using the contact information contained in Profiles. For example, an InsideView subscriber may use the InsideView Database in order to identify the specific individual who may be a decision maker in a company, and then contact the individual in order to offer goods or services for sale to the company.

Limited access to the InsideView Database is provided at no cost, whereas full access to the Database is subject to the payment of a subscription fee.

**2) Information We Collect From Our Subscribers and Visitors**

**Information Our Subscribers Provide About Themselves or Their Business**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information from subscribers of the InsideView Service is to provide them with a smooth and efficient experience while communicating with us and using InsideView. This allows us to provide customized services and features that are most likely to meet subscribers’ needs and that make their experience easier and quicker.

When an individual expresses an interest in obtaining information about InsideView or registering to use the Service, InsideView requires the individual to provide us with contact information such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address. InsideView may then use the contact information provided to reach the individual via email or phone.

When a subscriber purchases services, InsideView may require the subscriber to provide financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, payment/credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Service. InsideView may also ask for additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry.

**Payment Card Information**

InsideView does not retain payment or credit card numbers. This information is passed on immediately to our payment card processing service, which is required to use this information only for the processing of each specific transaction.

Once registered for the Service, a subscriber is able to add companies to his or her watch lists and automated search agents. We will retrieve and share information of interest to a subscriber, such as noteworthy events, address, phone number, and names of contacts on the companies that the subscriber wishes to watch.

**Information Our Subscribers may Provide for the Lead Referral Program**

If a subscriber chooses to use our lead referral service to refer a third party to our site, the subscriber must first ensure that his/her business partner has agreed to share their contact or other information with us. In this case, we will ask for the third party’s contact name, email address and phone number. We will use this information to contact the third party (example, via a one-time email or phone call) about becoming a subscriber of InsideView. InsideView stores this information for the sole purpose of following up on the lead and tracking the success of our referral program.

The third party may contact us to request that we remove his/her/its information from our lead referral contact list. See the Contacting Us section of this Policy for contact details or visit our website at [www.insideview.com/contact-us](http://www.insideview.com/contact-us/).

**Usage Data We Gather**

We also receive and store certain types of information whenever an individual (subscriber or visitor) interacts with our Site. InsideView automatically receives and records information on its server logs from the individual’s browser including the individual’s IP address, browser type, date/time stamp, InsideView cookie information, the page(s) that the individual requested, and the referring/exit pages.

**Cookies**

Cookies are small amounts of data sent to an individual’s browser from the InsideView Web servers and stored on the individual’s hard drive. InsideView uses cookies to deliver content specific to the individual’s interests and to keep track of user names and passwords during user sessions. If an individual chooses not to accept cookies, his or her ability to use InsideView might be limited. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personal information.

Generally, our Service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show

Our Site also contains third party cookies and other tracking technologies. The use of cookies or other tracking technologies by our tracking utility companies is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our third party tracking utility companies use session ID cookies to make it easier to track how many times individuals have visited a certain page on the site.

Our third party tracking utility companies employ a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), which they use in combination with their cookies. These beacons help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. The use of clear gifs by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our subscribers’ personal information.

**Correspondence**

If an individual corresponds with InsideView via email, or other method regarding his or her activities or postings on the Site, InsideView will treat that email or other correspondence as ordinary business correspondence and will retain it according to its standard corporate information retention policies.

**3) Our Use and Disclosure of Subscriber Information**

When subscribers provide us with personal information to include in a published individual Profile about the subscriber or any information to include in a published company Profile, the subscriber gives us permission to use and disclose that information for the purpose of providing the InsideView Service as described above.

**Subscribers’ Information**

We use information we maintain about subscribers and other information we obtain from our subscriber’s current and past activities on the Site: (1) to perform the InsideView services requested, including emailing administrative and service notifications; (2) for marketing purposes (such as contacting subscribers to discuss interest in InsideView, and sending promotional communications or other information regarding InsideView and its partners, that may be customized based on usage patterns; (3) to check financial qualifications or collect payment; (4) to operate and improve the Site, including using aggregated Site usage data to understand utilization and improve the Service; (5) to resolve disputes; (6) to troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use; and (7) to allow subscribers to post comments within the blog section of the Site as well as submit testimonials and allow us to post these statements and testimonials along with the subscriber’s name on the Site.

Subscribers may contact us to request removal of personal information from our blog or testimonials. See the Contacting Us section of this policy for contact details. As a subscriber, in some cases we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**IP Addresses**

InsideView uses IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.

**Behavioral Targeting / Re-targeting**

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [Here](http://preferences.truste.com/).  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.

**To whom we may Disclose Information**

InsideView may need or be required by law or legal process to disclose information about visitors, subscribers or Profiles to third parties. This includes: (a) to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that InsideView is or may become involved in as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; (b) to comply with a facially valid judicial or governmental subpoena, warrant, or other order or legal process served on InsideView by a court or a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information; (c) if InsideView reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability; or (d) to enforce or defend its rights or any of its policies (such as the Terms of Use Agreement).

**Disclosure to Service Providers**

InsideView may engage third parties to perform necessary business functions on its behalf, such as outside contractors or service providers (e.g. hosting company, consultants) for example, in connection with communications to users, payment processing and other aspects of Site operations. If it is necessary to perform their functions, these third parties may have access to Individual or Company information or Profiles. These third parties are required not to use any information or Profile for any purpose other than to provide services to InsideView. They are also required to protect the information and Profiles with adequate reasonable security measures.

**Transfer to Acquirer or Successor entity**

Finally, if InsideView sells a substantial portion of its assets or is acquired, reorganized, merged into another entity, goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, it is likely that subscriber, Profile and other business information (including the InsideView Database) will be one of the business assets transferred in connection with such a transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer or successor of InsideView or its assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Policy. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

User passwords are used to secure access to the InsideView Service and subscriber information. We encrypt the transmission of user IDs and passwords using Secure Socket Layers (SSL).

Our login page provides a service for subscribers to obtain a new password in case they forget their password.

When subscribers enter sensitive information (such as payment/credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

While we do our best to implement reasonable security measures, we do not guarantee that our safeguards will always work. InsideView will not be liable for unauthorized disclosure of Profile or other information that occurs through no fault of InsideView, including, but not limited to, error in transmission, misuse of a subscriber’s password and login credentials, a subscriber’s failure to comply with its security obligations, and the unauthorized acts of InsideView’s employees. Transmissions protected by industry standard technology and administered by humans cannot be guaranteed to be secure.
