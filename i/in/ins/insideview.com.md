**1\. Information We Collect**

Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while communicating with us and using InsideView. This allows us to provide customized services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and that make your experience easier and quicker.  


When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about InsideView or registering to use the service, InsideView requires you to provide us with contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address.. InsideView will then use the contact information you provide to reach you with additional information offline via email or phone.  


When purchasing services, InsideView may require you to provide us with financial qualification and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the service. InsideView may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry.  


Once registered you are able to add Companies to your watch list. We will retrieve information such as address, phone number and name of contact(s) on the companies you wish to watch.  


The SMART Agent feature is an automated search feature that keeps you up to date on the business activities as they occur at the companies you're interested in . Smart agents alert you about news and information around actions such as leadership changes, funding developments, expanding operations, etc. InsideView automatically follows several default search Agents, and you can add custom agents as well.  


You'll also find detailed company insights including company profiles, contact profiles, social media buzz, family tree, competitors, jobs, and more.  


_Lead Referral Program

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a business partner about our site, we will ask you for your partner’s name, email address and phone number. We will automatically use this information to contact your business partner about becoming a member of InsideView. If necessary, we will send them a one-time email inviting them to join the site. InsideView stores this information for the sole purpose of following up on the lead and/or sending this one-time email and tracking the success of our referral program.

Your business partner may contact us at [privacy@insideview.com](mailto:privacy@insideview.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.   


We also receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site. InsideView automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, date/time stamp, InsideView cookie information and the page you requested with referring/exit pages. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to a user's browser from the InsideView Web servers and stored on a user's hard drive. InsideView uses cookies to deliver content specific to users' interests, and to keep track of user names and passwords during user sessions. If you choose not to accept cookies, your ability to use InsideView might be limited. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information.  


Generally our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  


If you correspond with InsideView via email, or if other users or other third parties send us email or other correspondence regarding a particular user's activities or postings on the Site, InsideView may collect such information.  


The use of cookies by our tracking utility company is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our third party tracking utility company uses session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site and to track how many times users have visited a certain page on the site.  


_Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)_

Our third party tracking utility company employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers' personally identifiable information.

**2\. Security**

InsideView has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction of the information under our control. We have taken measures to protect user information once it is received by the InsideView Web site (the "Site"), including but not limited to the following: limited and controlled access by employees, servers and data stored in a secured location, security software and hardware (such as firewalls, encryption, Secure Socket Layers) where appropriate and cost effective.  


User passwords are used to secure access to the InsideView service and subscriber information. We encrypt the transmission of user IDs and passwords using Secure Socket Layers (SSL). If you choose to have InsideView remember you on your computer, InsideView will automatically log you in by storing your user ID (but not your password) in a cookie in your browser. Our login page provides a service for members to obtain a new password in case they forget their password.  


When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

**3\. Our Use and Disclosure of Your Information**  


Except as set forth in this Policy, at no time will we share your Personal Identifier Information with anyone, including those users with whom you communicate through InsideView. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide any Personal Identifier Information to any third parties for promotional purposes, and we do not use users' email addresses for unsolicited marketing. The only exceptions are when we either have your permission or as described in this Section. In some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about you, and InsideView will need to comply if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize us to do so.  


We use information we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site: (1) to perform the InsideView services requested, including emailing administrative and service notifications; (2) for marketing purposes (such as contacting you to discuss your interest in InsideView, and sending you promotional communications or other information, regarding InsideView and its partners, that may be customized based on your usage patterns); (3) to check financial qualifications or collect payment; (4) to operate and improve the Site, including using aggregated Site usage data to understand utilization and improve the service; (5) to resolve disputes; and (6) to troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement; (7) to allow you to post comments within the blog section of the site as well as submit testimonials and allow us to post them along with your name on the site. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or testimonials, contact us at [privacy@insideview.com](mailto:privacy@insideview.com). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.  


InsideView uses your IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.  


You consent to InsideView disclosing information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that InsideView is or may become involved in (a) as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights. InsideView may disclose some Personal Identifier Information to third party service providers, in connection with communications to users, process payments, and other aspects of operation of the Site. InsideView may also use your Personal Identifier Information to enforce any of its policies (such as the Terms of Use Agreement).  


Finally, in the case that InsideView sells a substantial portion of its assets or is acquired (or goes out of business or enters bankruptcy), customer information is typically one of the business assets transferred in connection with such a transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of InsideView may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.  


InsideView contains links to other sites. InsideView is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to review the policies of these sites.

**4\. Opting Out; Correcting and Updating Your Information**

You may opt-out of receiving promotional communications by contacting us at [support@insideview.com](mailto:support@insideview.com); provided, however that users of our free services may not opt-out of receiving such promotional communications while continuing to use such services.

Customers may update or change their registration information by editing their user or organization record. To update a user profile, please click on "My Profile" or email us at [support@insideview.com](mailto:support@insideview.com) if you require any assistance. Please note that information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and since we back up our systems. Therefore, Personal Identifier Information may not be completely removed from our databases in response to removal requests. We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you with services contact us at [support@insideview.com](mailto:support@insideview.com). We will retain and use your personal information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

InsideView has certified that it abides by the Safe Harbor privacy principles as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, storage, use, transfer and other processing of Personal Identifier Information (as defined below) transferred from the European Economic Area ("EEA") or Switzerland to the U.S. InsideView's Safe Harbor certification can be found on the U.S. Department of Commence Safe Harbor List.
