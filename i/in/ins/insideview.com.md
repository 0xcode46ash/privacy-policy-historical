**1\. Security  
**InsideView has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We have taken measures to protect user information once it is received by the InsideView Web site (the "Site"), including but not limited to the following: limited and controlled access by employees, servers and data stored in a secured location, security software and hardware (such as firewalls, encryption, Secure Socket Layers) where appropriate and cost effective.

**2\. Information We Collect  
**Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a smooth and efficient experience while using InsideView. This allows us to provide customized services and features that are most likely to meet your needs, and that make your experience easier and quicker.

When you subscribe to InsideView using our online registration process, we collect email addresses, a user ID, and a password. We also allow you to choose a screen name that will be displayed to other users instead of your user ID. Your user ID or screen name is used throughout InsideView to identify you to other InsideView Members. Therefore, you should be aware that if you use your real name as your user ID or screen name, this information would be visible to others on the site. If you use your email address as your user ID or screen name, this information could be visible to others on the site.

When you submit a Research Request, our Researchers will be able to see your user ID as the source of the submission.

User passwords are used to secure access to the InsideView service and subscriber information. We encrypt the transmission of user IDs and passwords using Secure Socket Layers (SSL). If you choose to have InsideView remember you on your computer, InsideView will automatically log you in by storing your user ID (but not your password) in a cookie in your browser. Our login page provides a service for members to obtain a new password in case they forget their password.

You can review, update and change your Personal Identifier Info -- including your screen name, email addresses, and password -- by clicking on the Personal Settings link on your My InsideView page.

Except as set forth in this Policy, at no time will we share your Personal Identifier Info with anyone, including those users with whom you communicate through InsideView. We use your email address to contact you regarding administrative notices, and to send you notifications requested by you in your Notifications Personal Settings (where you can change and stop notifications). You may not opt-out of administrative emails, which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option of canceling your subscription.

We use information we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look at your account information and transaction history to identify problems or resolve disputes. Moreover, such information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and since we back up our systems. Therefore, our users’ Personal Identifier Info may not be completely removed from our databases in response to user requests.

InsideView subscribers and visitors are encouraged to refer other potential subscribers, by entering a name and email address. We contact referred individuals to make them aware of our service. The contacted individuals are given an option to be removed from our mailing list.

We also receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site. InsideView automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type, date/time stamp, InsideView cookie information and the page you requested with referring/exit pages. Cookies are small amounts of data sent to a user's browser from the InsideView Web servers and stored on a user's computer's hard drive. InsideView uses cookies to deliver content specific to users' interests, and to keep track of user names and passwords during user sessions. If you choose not to accept cookies, your ability to use InsideView might be limited.

Generally our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show. InsideView only uses this data in aggregate form, as a statistical measure but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

InsideView uses your IP addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Generally, IP addresses tell us the location from which a person is connecting to us, what service provider the person is using, and which parts of the Site the User is visiting. We reserve the right to track IP addresses for the purposes of fraud prevention, and we reserve the right to release IP addresses to legal authorities.

If you send InsideView email correspondence, or if other users or other third parties send us email or other correspondence regarding a particular user's activities or postings on the Site, InsideView may collect such information.

**3\. Our Disclosure of Your Information.  
**We do not sell, rent, or trade any Personal Identifier Information to third parties, and we do not use users' email addresses for unsolicited marketing. The only exceptions are when we either have your permission or as described in this Section. In some cases, the government can compel the disclosure of information about you, and InsideView will need to comply if it believes such disclosure to be appropriate, in which case you authorize it to do so.

You also consent to InsideView disclosing information about you to actual or potential parties to a lawsuit that InsideView is or may become involved in (a) if it required to do so, (b) if it reasonably believes that such disclosures will potentially mitigate its liability, or (c) to enforce its rights. InsideView may disclose some Personal Identifier Information to third party service providers, in connection with communications to users and other aspects of operation of the site. InsideView may also use your Personal Identifier Information to enforce any of its policies (such as the Terms of Use Agreement).

Finally, in the case that InsideView sold substantially all of its assets or was acquired (or went out of business or entered bankruptcy), customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred in connection with such a transaction. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and that any acquirer of InsideView may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

InsideView contains links to other sites. InsideView is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage you to review the policies of these sites.

**4\. Account Cancellation Procedures  
**If you decide you would like to cancel your account on InsideView, you will need to send us an email- including your user name and email address - to support@insideview.com (if you can't remember your user name, send us the first and last name you provided when you joined)

**5\. Notification of Changes  
**If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes to this Privacy Policy so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via either email or by posting a notice on the our Web site for 30 days.

**6\. Effectiveness  
**The Effective Date of this policy is August 1, 2005. This is a new privacy policy statement, effective as of the date listed above.
