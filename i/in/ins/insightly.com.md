# Insightly: Privacy Policy

When You register for Insightly You can be certain that we have implemented comprehensive security practices to ensure that only You and those people You provide authorized access to can see your Insightly site.

## Information You Provide

When You register for the Service with Google, we receive information such as your name, e-mail address and Google Apps domain information. If You sign up for a paid plan, Insightly will use a third-party intermediary to manage credit card processing. This intermediary is not permitted to store, retain, or use your billing information except for the sole purpose of credit card processing on Insighly’s behalf.

You can modify your account information at anytime by clicking on the Settings icon in the global navigation bar at the top right of the screen. Insightly’s practice is not to use such personal information for marketing purposes unless explicitly authorised. Insightly may use the collected personal information and other information Insightly collects about your use of the Service to operate and make the Service available to You, for billing, identification and authentication, to contact You about your use of the Service, research purposes and to generally improve the content and functionality of the Service and Site.

Insightly may also transmit or share your personal information with its third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and other technology and services required to operate and maintain the Service, which may require that your personal information be transferred from Your current location to the offices and servers of Insightly and the authorized third parties referred to here. Although Insightly owns the software, code, databases, and all rights to the Insightly application, You retain all rights to your data.

## Cookies

Insightly uses persistent cookies that only Insightly can read and use, to identify You as a Insightly customer and make it easier for You to log in to the Service. Users who disable their web browsers’ ability to accept cookies will be able to browse our Site, but will not be able to access or take advantage of the Service.

## Information Sharing

Except as described in this policy, Insightly will not give, sell, rent, or loan any identifiable personal information to any third party. We may disclose such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We may also share such information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law. Insightly may also provide non-personal, summary or group statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
