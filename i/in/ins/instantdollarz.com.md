IV. COOKIES 

Though not in usage on this Site, cookies may be utilized on other sites owned by InstantDollarz Incorporated that require registration. Visitors to those sites are bound by the privacy policy and terms and conditions of those sites, though the following will always be true regarding cookies. 

On sites requiring registration, InstantDollarz Incorporated may use cookies: 1) to track new registrants and affiliates; 2) to temporarily remember username and password for the registrant so they do not need to be entered during every visit to the website, and whose function may be annulled simply by logging out. Electronic cookies provided by InstantDollarz Incorporated can only be seen by InstantDollarz Incorporated and cannot harm your computer. If Cookies are disabled, our website will not function properly.

A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the userâ€™s hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

InstantDollarz Incorporated also uses cookies to track generic information such as timestamp, number of pages viewed, unique site visitors and other non-identifiable information. As this information does not disclose the identity or PII of any specific user, we may use or disclose non-PII in any way and with any third party.

We cannot be responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites, or the services or representations made by third-party advertisers.
