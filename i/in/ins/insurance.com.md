**1\. Introduction**

Insurance.com has created this Privacy Statement and Q & A in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website (insurance.com) and a similar site accessible through the Insurance Center at www.fidelity.com. The statement also discloses how your information is used by other companies we do business with. TRUSTe’s certification covers the privacy practices at these sites operated by Insurance.com. 

**2\. What organizations have access to my nonpublic personally identifiable information?**

****
  1. **Insurance.com and its Fidelity affiliates**  
On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of areas where you can input information: for storage, to calculate insurance premiums or quotes, to register with Insurance.com and to process insurance purchase requests. We also gather information about your internet address to help understand site usage. In addition, we receive information collected by the insurance agencies or insurance companies that respond to your on-line requests, including application information and information about the insurance policies you purchase. Insurance.com and its technology or marketing service providers may have access to this information, and Insurance.com may share this information from time to time with its Fidelity affiliates.
  2.  **Quoting Providers**  
The quoting process is anonymous; that is, you do not have to identify yourself or provide information by which you could be identified in order to obtain quote information. Should you wish to gain quotes for a particular line of insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, coverage amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with a third-party quoting provider in order to match your information to a list of quotes. Each quoting provider has agreed with us that this information will be used by them only in connection with services you request. 
  3. **Insurance Agencies and Insurance Carriers - - In General**  
Should you decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a quote through one of our quoting providers, you will be asked to provide additional information needed to complete an insurance application. With your authorization, this information will be forwarded either (1) to an independent insurance agency which has been appointed by the insurance carrier you select and which has agreed to use the information only for the purposes of completing your transaction with the carrier, or (2) directly to the carrier that you have chosen or its affiliated insurance agency. Carriers use personally identifiable information (such as name and address) in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium estimate. However, the criteria for ratings may vary between participating insurance companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on particular items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may be used to verify information that you have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims history from a third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com may be updated of your progress. PLEASE NOTE: The insurance carriers are required by law to have their own privacy policies, which likely differ from those of Insurance.com. You may wish to obtain and review the carriers’ policies.
  4.  **Health Insurance**  
If you are interested in health insurance, please see the Health Insurance Privacy Policy of Insurance.com and eHealthInsurance Services, Inc.
  5.  **Links to Third Party Insurance Sites**  
In some states, or for some lines of coverage (e.g., homeowners or renters coverage and pet health coverage), we may provide direct links to insurance company or insurance agency sites, usually because we cannot obtain comparative quote information. If you provide information on a carrier web site or purchase insurance from a carrier as a result of visiting Insurance.com, the carrier may share that information with Insurance.com, but Insurance.com will not share it with any unaffiliated third parties. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of these third party insurance companies or the content of their web sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements on the sites of each insurance company or third party agent with which you interact.
  6.  **Other Third Party Links**  
You also have the opportunity to purchase books through links with unaffiliated on-line sellers. If you visit those sellers' sites, information (such as type of book, number of sales, etc.), but no personal information, will be shared with Insurance.com. Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices on these third party sites. We recommend that you read the privacy statements on these sites. 



**3\. How is my nonpublic personally identifiable information used?**

****
  1. **Providing Services You Request**  
Information that you provide during the quoting process is used to fulfill your requests for insurance quotes or applications. Information you provide during the registration process is:   

    * used to facilitate your requests for insurance quotes or applications;   

    * used to distribute newsletters, optional user experience surveys or other materials, unless you opt not to receive this information; and   

    * stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to enable you to re-access the information at your convenience. 
  2. **Site Usage - - Cookies**  
Insurance.com also gathers anonymous information and aggregate demographic information, which does not personally identify you. We use this information to better understand our site usage patterns, and we may share this information with third parties for marketing or technology purposes. Generally this information is collected through "traffic data" and may entail the use of "Cookies," "Internet Protocol" addresses or other numeric codes or tags used to identify a computer. Again, any disclosure of anonymous information and/or aggregate demographic information will not reveal any personally identifiable information about specific users.

A 'cookie' is a message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is installed on. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track user's aggregate data from sites other than our own. The only cookie-based data that we track is activity on our own site concerning demographics and site usage analysis. The user needs to have cookies enabled in order to use restricted features of the site.

  3.  **Quoting**  
We offer you the ability to request quotes anonymously. There is no requirement to register or login prior to requesting a quote. As noted above, we share this information with third party quote providers in order to obtain the quote information you request. The information given during the quoting process is not utilized by Insurance.com for any other purposes and it is not possible for Insurance.com or others to identify you personally based on the inputs you give.
  4.  **No Other Disclosure to Unaffiliated Third Parties**  
Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we do not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties, other than the above-described parties with which we contract to make certain services available through our web site and which have agreed that they will keep your information confidential. However, we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of our web site with quoting aggregators, participating insurance companies or other companies we do business with; in this case, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed. 



**4\. What choices are available to me regarding the collection, use and distribution of my nonpublic personally identifiable information?**

All information provided in connection with the use of the Personal Organizer is optional. During the registration process you are given the option to opt-in to an email distribution list that will provide you with information concerning promotions and updates to the Insurance.com site. You can also choose to opt-out if you no longer wish to receive emails regarding site updates and insurance related information by going to ‘Your Profile’ in the Personal Organizer and changing the ‘Receive Emails’ option to No. 

During the quoting process on Insurance.com you will always retain complete control over what information you disclose in the quoting / application processes and to which insurance carriers, if any, it is sent. You will be asked for your name, contact details and other information only if you decide to proceed with coverage from a company that has offered an online quote. With respect to third party sites to which you may link through Insurance.com, any choices regarding the handling of your personal information will be described on such parties' web sites. You should refer to the privacy statements for those sites for more information. 

**5\. What security measures are in place to protect my nonpublic personally identifiable information?**

This site uses strong security measures to protect the personal data you provide. Your personal data is stored on a system not directly connected to the Internet. We use a variety of security systems and control measures to restrict access to your data. We use authentication methods to confirm the identity of trusted parties. We support encryption technologies to protect the transmission of your data when you are supplying it, or if we are passing it to other companies we do business with. 

**6\. How can I correct any inaccuracies in my nonpublic personally identifiable information?**

Personal information that you input into the Personal Organizer, including policy information and home inventory details can be altered using the ‘Your Profile’ and then the 'Edit' button. You can also update your email address and password by clicking on the link in the 'Your Profile' section of the Personal Organizer. 

Within the quoting process, you are able to change your information by returning to the previous page via the back button of the browser, or by verifying and editing the information prior to submission. 

**7\. Changes to the privacy statement.**

Insurance.com may change its privacy practices in the future. If we change the way we treat any nonpublic personally identifiable information, we will:  


  * Post a revised privacy policy at this location; and  

  * In the event the change could affect your nonpublic personally identifiable information already in our database, we will email you to notify you of the change and include an option for you to opt-out of the process.
