**1\. Introduction**

Insurance.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the website: [www.insurance.com](http://www.insurance.com/). The statement also discloses how your information is used by our partners. However, only information that is collected by or shared with insurance.com is covered by TRUSTe. 

**2\. What organizations have access to my information?**

Insurance.com and its affiliates  
On the Insurance.com website, we have a variety of areas where you can input information: for storage, to calculate insurance premiums or quotes, to register with Insurance.com and to process insurance purchase requests. We may also gather information about your internet address to help understand site usage. During the quoting process, you can provide information anonymously. This information is shared between Insurance.com and the quoting provider and is only used for aggregated statistical analysis. Insurance.com will not share any information that identifies you as an individual with any third parties without your consent. 

Quoting Providers  
Should you wish to gain a quote for a particular line of insurance, information will be collected (for example car model, coverage amount, etc.) that is shared by Insurance.com with the quoting provider in order to match your information to a list of quotes. Unless otherwise indicated on the relevant site, each quoting provider has agreed with us that this information will be used by them only in connection with services you request. However, Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the quoting providers' web sites. It is recommended that you also read the privacy statements on these sites. 

Insurance Carriers  
Should you decide to apply for a particular insurance policy after obtaining a quote through one of our quoting providers, your information will be forwarded by the quoting provider to the carrier that you have chosen or an agent associated with that carrier. Your information would be forwarded only at your direction or if required by law. Carriers use personally identifiable information (such as name and address) in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs to provide an insurance premium estimate. However, the criteria for ratings may vary between participating insurance companies, with each carrier placing a different emphasis on particular items of information you provide. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may be used to verify information that you have provided, to request a credit report or review your claims history from a third party. As your application proceeds, Insurance.com may be updated of your progress. 

Other Third Party Links  
You also have the opportunity to purchase books through links with unaffiliated on-line sellers. If you visit those sellers' sites, generic information (such as type of book, number of sales, etc.), but no personal information, will be shared with Insurance.com. 

Insurance.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of third party insurance companies or agents or the content of any web sites sponsored by such insurance companies or agents. It is recommended that you read the privacy statements on the sites of each insurance company or third party agent with which you interact. 

**3\. How is my personally identifiable information used?**

Information that you provide in connection with the registration and quoting process and information that you submit in connection with your use of the Personal Organizer is used to process your requests for quotes or other services. This information also may be stored by our service providers or within the Insurance.com site in order to enable you to re-access the information at your convenience. In addition, at your option, you may direct us to notify you via your e-mail address of special promotions and updates to the site that may be of interest to you. 

In addition to information you submit through the registration and quoting process, or information you submit in connection with your use of our Personal Organizer, we use "cookies" to better understand our site usage patterns. A 'cookie' is a message given to a Web browser by a Web server. The browser stores the message in a small text file on the same drive that the browser is installed on. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. It will not be used to help track user's aggregate data from sites other than our own. The only cookie-based data that we track is activity on our own site concerning demographics and site usage analysis. The user needs to have cookies enabled in order to use restricted features of the site. 

We offer you the ability to request quotes anonymously. There is no requirement to register or login prior to requesting a quote. The information given during the quoting process is not utilized by Insurance.com for any other purposes and it is not possible for Insurance.com to identify you personally based on the inputs you give. 

Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, we do not willfully disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties other than service providers with whom we contract to make certain services available through our web site and who have agreed that they will keep your information confidential. However, we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of our web site with quoting aggregators, participating insurance companies or other business partners. Even in this case, your personally identifiable information is not disclosed. 

**4\. What choices are available to me regarding the collection, use and distribution of my information?**

All information provided in connection with the use of the Personal Organizer is optional. 

During the registration process you are given the option to opt-in to an email distribution list that will provide you with information concerning promotions and updates to the Insurance.com site. You can also choose to opt-out if you no longer wish to receive emails regarding site updates and insurance related information by going to Your Profile in the Personal Organizer and changing the Receive Emails option to No. 

During the quoting process on Insurance.com you will always retain complete control over what information you disclose in the quoting / application processes and to which insurance carriers, if any, it is sent. You will be asked for your name, contact details and other information only if you decide to proceed with coverage from a company that has offered an online quote. 

With respect to third party sites to which you may link through Insurance.com, any choices regarding the handling of your personal information will be described on such parties' web sites. You should refer to the privacy statements for those sites for more information. 

**5\. What security measures are in place to protect my information?**

This site uses strong security measures to protect the personal data you provide. Your personal data is stored on a system not directly connected to the Internet. We use a variety of security systems and control measures to restrict access to your data. We use authentication methods to confirm the identity of trusted parties. We support encryption technologies to protect the transmission of your data when you are supplying it, or if we are passing it to our partners. 

**6\. How can I correct any inaccuracies in my information?**

Personal information that you input into the Personal Organizer, including policy information and home inventory details can be altered using the 'Edit' button. 

You can also update your email address by clicking on the link in the 'Your Profile' section of the Personal Organizer. 

Within the quoting process, you are able to change your information by returning to the previous page via the back button of the browser, or by verifying and editing the information prior to submission.

Insurance.com reserves the right to change this privacy statement at any time. If we decide to alter the policy, we will post the new privacy statement on this page and will show the date of change using the 'Last Updated' statement below.
