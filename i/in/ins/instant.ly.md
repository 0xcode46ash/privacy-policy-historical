**Personal Information**

Personal information which we collect for a particular purpose will only be saved and used for that purpose, unless you have agreed to allow us to use it for some other purpose, as described in this Privacy Policy. For example, if you provide your personal information in connection with a request for customer support, we will use your personal information to contact you regarding such request.

We will not contact you with marketing solicitations or for promotional purposes, unless you have previously elected to opt-in to receive such communications. From time-to-time we may disclose your personal information to certain third party service providers and/or contractors of the uSamp. For example, we may provide your billing information to one of our payment processors, your name and email address to our email service provider to send you emails on our behalf or to our customer support provider to assist you with questions you may have through email and live chat software. However, uSamp uses commercially reasonable contractual and technical protections in an effort to ensure that your information will only be used by such service providers and/or contractors for the particular purpose for which it was disclosed. Generally, we will only disclose your personal information to third parties when (i) we have given you notice of such disclosure (e.g., this privacy policy), and (ii) we have obtained your express consent to disclose (e.g., when you opt-in to disclosure).

As a creator of a survey, we treat your survey data as if it were your personal information. As such, we store survey data on your behalf but will not disclose survey data unless you have specifically authorized us to do so. In addition, we do not and will not sell survey data to third parties. 

We encourage you to download and backup your survey data. However, once you have downloaded your survey data, it is your duty to protect your copy of your survey data. In addition, you should diligently protect your account information and refrain from disclosing such information to any third parties, as uSamp is not responsible for any survey data downloaded by an unauthorized user of your account. 

As a respondent to a survey, please note that, as previously discussed herein, the survey creator is ultimately responsible for the privacy of your survey data. Consequently, you should consider the privacy risks involved before providing any personal information or data in a response to a survey that could be used to identify you.

We sometimes share non-personal information with third parties about our user base, but that information does not include any personal information. We may use non-personal information to learn what you like, tailor your experience accordingly, and to improve the Website and our other products.
