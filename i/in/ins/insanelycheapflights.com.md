We may amend this Privacy Policy at any time. All amended terms automatically take effect when this Privacy Policy is updated. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy will mean that you accept those changes.

Insanelycheapflights is a licensee of the TRUSTe Web Privacy Seal Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build user’s trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this Site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact customer service at [feedback@Insanelycheapflights.com](mailto:feedback@Insanelycheapflights.com) . If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with us to resolve your concerns.

Insanelycheapflights is committed to providing fair information practices and adopts the highest degree of privacy policy in protecting customer’s private and personal information submitted to Insanelycheapflights in connection with purchasing travel products from Insanelycheapflights.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date).

Insanelycheapflights uses this information for billing purposes and to fulfill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, Insanelycheapflights will use this information to contact you.

Insanelycheapflights does not sell, trade, share or rent your personal information to others without your prior consent. We keep your personal information private and secure in our databases and during transfer to our agents, service providers and third party marketing partners. When you use our system, you are asked to provide your name, email address and other information. We use this information to answer your questions and process your requests for services from us and/or for products or services from our agents, service providers and third party marketing partners.

To keep you informed about our latest services, we may notify you via email newsletter of any changes or new additions to our site. You may unsubscribe from our email newsletter by following the unsubscribe instructions in any email you receive from us.

Other sites accessible through our Site have their own privacy policies and data collection practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. Insanelycheapflights is not responsible for the actions of third parties. 

Agents 

Like many other sites, this Site uses cookies to personalize your experience, and to speed up the member sign in process. Cookies are information stored on your computer. Cookies are not used to track your movement or perform any function other than to enhance your use of our Site and are not linked to personal information. If your browser does not support cookies, or you have not enabled cookies in your browser, many of these time-saving features will not work properly. Also, you need to have cookies enabled in your browser if you want to enter the member’s area.

A cookie may be placed by our advertising server. These cookies are used only for purposes of tracking the effectiveness of advertising served by us on our Site. No personal information about you is gathered by the use of these cookies. Cookies may be placed by our third-party advertising companies who may use aggregated statistics about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about travel-related goods and services that you may be interested in. The information collected does not include your personal information. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Insanelycheapflights only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

Third Party Tracking Technologies 

We use a third-party tracking service called Google Analytics that uses tracking technology to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate.

We use an outside shipping company to ship paper tickets, and a credit card processing company to bill you for travel products. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes. 

Security 

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [To learn more about SSL, follow this [link](http://www.godaddy.com/)]

All of our secure servers use a high-grade encryption key (RC4 with 128 bit secret key).

While secure mode provides SSL encryption, pages will take longer to download. Most users choose to sign up or sign in using standard mode to achieve quicker response time.

If you receive browser warnings when going from secure mode pages to non-SSL pages, it is most likely a warning that you are switching servers. As long as your data is entered on a secure mode page, it will only be transmitted to a secure server.

We follow accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We urge you to take every precaution to protect you personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

If you have any questions about security on our Site, you can send us an email or contact us [feedback@insanelycheapflights.com](mailto:feedback@insanelycheapflights.com) (845) 848 0411 

Government And Legal 

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site. 

Access to Personally Identifiable Information 

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer wish to use our services, you may correct, update, delete or deactivate it by emailing our Customer Support at [feedback@insanelycheapflights.com](mailto:feedback@insanelycheapflights.com) or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. 

Children's Privacy Protection 

Insanelycheapflights understands the importance of protecting children's privacy in the interactive online world. The Site is not designed for, or intentionally targeted at, children 13 years of age or younger. It is not our policy to intentionally collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13. 

Opt-Out 

We provide you the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a travel product, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in our order form.

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication, or by contacting us at the address below.

You will be notified when your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our agent/service provider, so you can make an informed choice as to whether or not to share your information with that party.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
