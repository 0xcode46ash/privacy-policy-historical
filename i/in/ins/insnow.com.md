     PRIVACY NOTICE AND NOTICE OF INSURANCE INFORMATION PRACTICES
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND
DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT
CAREFULLY.
Ceres Group, Inc.’s affiliated insurance companies are required by law to maintain the privacy of your
health and financial information and to provide you with notice of its legal duties and privacy practices with
respect to this information.
Federal and state laws and regulations require us to maintain the privacy of your information and provide
you with notice regarding our privacy and information practices. This Notice is designed to inform you of
the types of information that we collect from our customers, how we protect and use that information, and
the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties.
How We Collect Information:
We get most information from you or anyone you have authorized to provide the information. Information
is obtained from your application for insurance, from other related forms or through a verification phone
call with you. If additional information is needed we may obtain it from your independent sales agent,
physicians, hospitals, or other medical personnel, your employer, other transactions with our company
or its affiliates, other insurers, the Medical Information Bureau or consumer reporting agencies.
Information collected may relate to your personal characteristics, employment, health, avocations,
finances, as well as transactions with us or our affiliates. The information we collect might include name,
address, Social Security number, telephone number, date of birth, medical and family history and
dependent information. It may also include type and plan of insurance, other insurance you own, claim
data, the amount of insurance premiums, or any other Information.
How We Protect Information:
All Ceres Companies maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information
we have obtained about you and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access to that information.
Electronic records are protected by multiple computer software products that use security features such
as passwords, encryption, user identification numbers, and personal identification numbers to guard
against unauthorized access. Our internal systems contain electronic firewalls and other security
measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to our electronic records. We also employ surveil-
lance software to determine if any abnormal activity occurs. Electronic points of entry, as well as
databases, servers, e-mail and workstations are generally protected by virus detection/removal software.
We train all employees on our Privacy Policy and the importance of the privacy and confidentiality of all
information we collect.
How We Use and Disclose Information:
We are permitted by law to use and disclose any information we collect when we believe it is necessary
for us to conduct or service our business or where disclosure is required by law. For example, information
may be disclosed while you are insured, or after your insurance terminates, to:
   • Anyone to whom you have authorized us to disclose the information;
   • Your independent sales agent to service your policy;
   • Claims adjusters to process your claims;
   • Underwriters to accept or reject your request for insurance;
   • Investigators and attorneys;
   • Consultants, Third-party administrators, PPO Networks, and healthcare clearinghouses;
AEF-0520                                                            1                                                     (Rev. 06/04/02)


   • Data processing firms and billing firms;
   • Our affiliated companies, business associates, other insurance companies and reinsurers;
   • Persons or organizations that conduct audits and research, including actuarial or underwriting studies;
   • Persons/entities performing general administrative and claim processing activities for us;
   • Insurance regulators, courts or government agencies or others as may be permitted or required by
     law; and
   • Your employer, if you are covered through an employer-sponsored plan, for the purpose of replacing
     coverage.
We may also use information obtained from a Consumer Reporting Organization. If a report is required,
you may request to be interviewed and request to receive a copy of the report.
If your coverage with us is not a health insurance plan, information may also be shared with our affiliates
so that they may offer you other Ceres products and services. We may also provide information to others
outside Ceres with whom we have a joint marketing agreement. For example, we may have a joint
marketing agreement with another insurer to enable us to offer you that company’s insurance products.
Any person or entity with whom we share information has entered into a written agreement to maintain
the same high standards of privacy and confidentiality that we require of our own employees and affiliates.
We do not make disclosures of information to any other companies that may want to sell their products
or services to you. We will not sell any information to a catalog company. We do not disclose information
subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act except as permitted or required by law.
Other disclosures will be made only with your written authorization, which you may revoke at any time.
You have the right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosure of your health information. We
are not required to agree to the restriction you have requested.
Right to Access and Correct information
You have a right to inspect and obtain a copy your protected health and financial information by
submission of a written request. You have the right to receive your health information through a
reasonable alternative means or at an alternative location. We may impose a reasonable fee for this
service as permitted. You have a right to ask for an accounting of any disclosures of information. You may
ask us to correct or change our records regarding your information, by submitting a written request to
include the reason for the change. If we agree, we will make the correction/change. If we do not agree,
you may submit a short statement of dispute, which we will include in any future disclosure of information.
Notification of Our Privacy and Insurance Information Practices
We are required to abide by the terms of this Notice, which is effective June 1, 2002. Federal law requires
us to provide this summary of our Privacy Policy once each year. We will notify you within 60 days if at
any time we change our Privacy Policy. Any future notices will be sent by U.S. mail to your last known
address.
