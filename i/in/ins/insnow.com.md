    PRIVACY NOTICE AND NOTICE OF INSURANCE INFORMATION PRACTICES
THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND
DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT
CAREFULLY.
We are required by law to maintain the privacy of your health and financial information and to provide you
with notice of our legal duties and privacy practices with respect to this information.
Federal and state laws and regulations require us to maintain the privacy of your information and provide
you with notice regarding our privacy and information practices. This Privacy Notice is designed to inform
you of the types of information that we collect from our customers, how we protect and use that
information, and the circumstances under which we will share it with third parties.
We are required to abide by the terms of this Privacy Notice, which is effective July 1, 2003. Federal law
requires us to provide this summary of our privacy practices once each year. We reserve the right to
change the terms of this Privacy Notice and to make any new Privacy Notice provisions effective for all
protected health information that we maintain. We will notify you within 60 days if at any time we change
our privacy practices in a way that materially affects the content of this Privacy Notice. Any future Privacy
Notices will be sent by U.S. mail to your last known address.
How We Collect Information:
We get most information from you or anyone you have authorized to provide the information. Information
is obtained from your application for insurance, from other related forms or through a verification phone
call with you. If additional information is needed we may obtain it from your independent sales agent,
physicians, hospitals, or other medical personnel, your employer, other transactions with our company
or its affiliates, other insurers, the Medical Information Bureau or consumer reporting agencies.
Information collected may relate to your personal characteristics, employment, health, avocations, and
finances, as well as transactions with us or our affiliates. The information we collect might include name,
address, Social Security Number, telephone number, date of birth, medical and family history and
dependent information. It may also include type and plan of insurance, other insurance you own, claim
data, the amount of insurance premiums, or any other information.
How We Protect Information:
We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the information we have obtained
about you and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access to that information. Electronic records are
protected by multiple computer software products that use security features such as passwords,
encryption, user identification numbers, and personal identification numbers to guard against unautho-
rized access. Our internal systems contain electronic firewalls and other security measures designed to
prevent unauthorized access to our electronic records. We also employ surveillance software to
determine if any abnormal activity occurs. Electronic points of entry, as well as databases, servers, e-mail
and workstations are generally protected by virus detection/removal software. We train all employees on
our privacy practices and the importance of the privacy and confidentiality of all information we collect.
How We Use and Disclose Information:
We do not disclose information outside what is permitted by law. We are permitted by law to use and
disclose any information we collect when we believe it is necessary for us to conduct or service our
business or where disclosure is required by law. For example, information may be used or disclosed while
you are insured, or after your insurance terminates, to:
   • Anyone to whom you have authorized us to disclose the information;
   • Your independent sales agent to service your policy;
   • Claims adjusters to process your claims;

purposes without your authorization. Examples in which protected health information may be used or
disclosed for marketing purposes without your authorization may include:

marketing or business associate agreement. We do not make disclosures of information to any other entity
that may want to sell their products or services to you. We do not disclose information subject to the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, except as permitted or required by law.
All business associates with whom we share information enter into a written agreement to maintain the
same high standards of privacy and confidentiality that we require of our own employees and
affiliates.Other disclosures of your personal information will be made only with your written authorization,
