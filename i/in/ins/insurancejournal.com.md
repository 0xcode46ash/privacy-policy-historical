To ensure that your personally identifiable information is accurate and up to date, we encourage you to contact us to update your information in the event your home, work or email address change, or you wish to add an additional method for us to communicate with you. Please note that in an effort to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of your personally identifiable information, you may be  
asked to provide proof of identity (or other authentication materials) together with the completed access request form. Access to personally identifiable information from non-Insurance Journal subscribers cannot be provided by telephone.

Occasionally, information that you request to be removed will be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to properly resolve disputes or to troubleshoot problems. In addition, some types of information may be stored indefinitely on “back up” systems or within log files due to technical constraints, or financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect  
that all of your personally identifiable information would be completely removed from our databases in response to your request for deactivation.

**Security**

Insurance Journal recognizes the importance of information security, and is constantly reviewing and enhancing all technical, physical, and logical security rules and procedures. After information reaches Insurance Journal, it is stored on a secure server that resides behind firewalls designed to block unauthorized access from outside of Insurance Journal. All Insurance Journal owned websites and servers have security measures in place to help protect your personally identifiable information against loss, misuse, and alteration while under our control. Although “guaranteed security” does not exist either on or off the internet, we safeguard your information using both procedural and technical safeguards. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), an encryption method used to help protect your data from interception and hacking while in transit. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contact Us” section set forth below.

**Links To Other Web Sites**

In order to anticipate your needs, Insurance Journal provides links to other web sites for your convenience and information. Insurance Journal is not responsible or liable for any content presented by or contained within any independent web site, including, but not limited to, any advertising claims or marketing practices. Please note that while Insurance Journal will protect your information on Insurance Journal owned and operated web sites, we cannot control and will not be responsible for the privacy policies of third party web sites, including web sites owned or controlled by independent franchisees or third party owners of companies that may use the name of an Insurance Journal brand, or web sites not controlled or authorized by Insurance Journal. Third party web sites that are accessed through links on our web site have separate privacy and data collection practices, and security measures. We have no responsibility or liability for the practices, policies and security measures implemented by third parties on their web sites. We encourage you to contact them to ask questions about their privacy practices, policies and security measures before disclosing any personally identifiable information. We recommend that you review the privacy statements and policies of linked web sites to understand how those web sites collect, use and store information.

**Children**

Insurance Journal does not seek to obtain, nor does it wish to receive personally identifiable information directly from minors; however, we cannot always determine the age of persons who access and use our web site. If a minor (as defined by applicable law) provides us with his/her data without parental or guardian consent, we encourage the parent or guardian to contact us to have this  
information removed and to unsubscribe the minor from any future Insurance Journal marketing communications.
