# Privacy policy - Inspire

Welcome to Inspire, an online community website ("Site") and thank you for reviewing this Privacy Statement. This Site is operated by ClinicaHealth, Inc. ("ClinicaHealth") and is designed to connect persons (such as those with certain health conditions, caregivers, and professionals) who are interested in sharing and receiving information regarding various health conditions (the "Service").

ClinicaHealth, the operator of this Site and the administrator of the Service, understands that users of this Service may provide personal information relating to health conditions, demographics, and contact information. This Statement informs you of our practices with respect to the online collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by means of this Service. We reserve the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Statement, and any changes to this Privacy Statement will be posted here. Please refer back to this Privacy Statement regularly because your use of this Site signifies that you agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement, as might be amended from time to time.

**What Information About You Do We Collect?**

You may view some content on this Site without providing any personal information. For example, you may review blogs and discussions written by registered users of the site. However, you must register in order to post a profile, submit items for discussion, write a blog, write comments about discussion entries and blog entries, post a message, or communicate with others via this Service. At the registration page, you are asked to provide certain personal information, including a functioning e-mail address at which we may contact you, your ZIP Code, your gender, and your date of birth. Upon registering, you become a Member.

You are also given an option to provide additional personal information, for example, to create an extended online profile. In addition, it is possible for you to provide personal information about yourself when you post content on the Service or communicate with other registered Members.

We also collect "clickstream" data as you use different features of our Site so we can monitor the performance of the Site and Service and learn how different aspects of the Site and Service are used. It is possible to combine this information with the personal information that you provide to us.

**What We Do With Your Personal Information**

We use personal information that you provide to us in several ways. First, we use it to confirm your Membership, to understand better who is visiting our Site and using our Service, and to enable us to present content, including advertising, which might suit your interests.

Second, we may use the personal information you give us to send you information about ClinicaHealth and the Service, as well as material on behalf of some of our third parties with whom we have a business relationship. By third parties, we mean, for example, entities such as health associations and advertisers that link to our Site or that make use of our Service. The information we send you may, on occasion, contain advertising or requests either from us or from a third party on whose behalf we would send the information. For example, we may contact you to see whether you are interested in being considered for an upcoming clinical trial that is being sponsored by a pharmaceutical company.

Third, when you confirm your registration, your profile becomes visible to users of the Service and your profile may be found by users of the Service using the Service's search features. You can control how your profile and the data it contains are shared using the privacy settings available to you in the account section of the Site.

Fourth, we may share personal information with entities that are not part of the ClinicaHealth family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose your identity or contain individually identifiable personal information.

Fifth, ClinicaHealth may disclose personal information to appropriate persons in circumstances where we have a good faith belief that a user is likely to cause bodily harm to him or herself or others.

Otherwise, we do not share, sell, or otherwise disclose personal information that is individually identifiable (including your e-mail address or your personal information) to any other company that we do not control without your prior consent, except as required by law (see Legal Process, below). For example, we do not rent our Member list to other companies. We may, however, provide other companies with aggregated data about our Members that does not contain contact or other individually identifiable personal information. Thus, for example, we may inform a health association of the number of Members we have on this Service, or the number of Members registered for our Service in a particular geographical region.

Finally, it is possible that by posting a message on the Service or communicating with other Members, you will disclose your own personal information.

**Your Choices**

You are not required to provide any personal information in order to view information that appears on this Site. However, in order to post content or see profiles of Members or communicate with Members, you must register. When you register, you must provide the personal information designated as "required" on the registration page. After you have registered, you will have the opportunity to provide additional personal information and to create an extended personal profile, including the posting of a photograph. Whether you provide this additional personal information is entirely your option, although it may affect your full enjoyment of the Service.

We do not disclose individually identifiable information about you to third parties without your prior consent. For example, we might contact you to advise you that a pharmaceutical company is planning a clinical trial and to see if you would be interested in learning more information. If you consent, we would arrange for the company to contact you; however, if you did not consent, we would not provide information about you to that company.

**Banner Advertising**

We may allow another company to serve advertisements on our Site. That company may set "cookies" on your computer. We will not share any individually identifiable personal information that you provide to us with such advertising company, and it will not have access to your personal profile. However, it is possible that such advertising company may, through your use of this Site and other Websites, develop its own separate profile of you. Any information collected or stored by the ad-service or the cookies is subject to the terms and policies of that company.

**Sale or Merger**

If so, ClinicaHealth will seek to obligate the acquiring company to use any personal information transferred by this Site in a manner consistent with this Privacy Statement, but cannot guarantee that it will be able to impose that requirement, or that the acquiring company will comply.

If you do not wish the personal information you provide to be subject to this possibility, you should deactivate your membership by notifying [team@inspire.com](mailto:team@inspire.com) and including "DEACTIVATE" in the subject line.
