> 
> ## _Q &A About Privacy_
> 
> In order to make it easier to understand InsWeb's privacy policies, we've arranged this document in a question and answer format. 
> 
> _How does InsWeb use my information?_
> 
>     InsWeb uses your personally identifiable information to prepare your insurance profile. From this profile, InsWeb generates instant, online quotes (as available) using the rating methods of our participating insurance companies. If you meet their criteria, other participating insurance companies may offer to provide an offline quote. 
> 
> Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, InsWeb does not willfully use or disclose personally identifiable information. However, we may share aggregated statistical information about the use of the InsWeb web site with our participating insurance companies or business partners. Even in this case, individual users' personally identifiable information is not disclosed.
> 
> _How do InsWeb's participating insurance companies use my information?_
> 
>     All of the companies use the information you provide for one general purpose: to provide you with an accurate insurance quote. Personally identifiable information such as name, address, or Social Security number is collected as part of the process of requesting a quote. Companies use your personally identifiable information in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs. However, the rating criteria may be different for each participating insurance company and each company may place different emphasis on particular aspects of your information. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may also be used to request a credit report or your claims history from a third party, or to verify other information you have provided.
> 
> _When do you send my information to an insurance company? Do I have control over this?_
> 
>     Yes, you always have total control over whether or not InsWeb sends your personally identifiable information to insurance companies, and to which companies this information is sent. To request coverage from a company that has offered an online quote, or to request an offline quote, you can choose to send your name, contact information, and the detailed information you provided on the quote request form to one or more insurance companies. In either case, this information is only sent at your direction.
> 
> _Why do some of InsWeb's quote request forms require so much information?_
> 
>     InsWeb works with many insurance companies. Since these companies use different criteria to rate prospective customers, the form must encompass a wide range of questions. The comprehensive form ensures that you receive the largest number of quotes for your particular circumstances. The consequence of declining to provide some requested information is that InsWeb may be unable to provide quotes from participating insurance companies.
> 
> _How can I change my information?_
> 
>     At any point in the request for quote process, you can use your browser's back button to return to previous pages. When you have returned to one of the summary pages, select the "Change" button to modify your information.
> 
> _How do I access my information?_
> 
>     To retrieve your previously entered information, select the "Returning User" button on the first page of the quote request form. After you enter your user name and password, you will be able to view the form containing the information you entered earlier.
> 
> _After I request quotes at InsWeb, who will contact me?_
> 
>     If you request quotes or coverage at InsWeb, representatives of the companies you have selected will contact you with information regarding your quotes or coverage. You will only be contacted by these representatives if you specifically have requested it. 
> 
> In addition, InsWeb e-mails a quality control survey to all customers who request quotes or coverage. This survey is sent out within 4-5 days after your request, and is completely optional. 
> 
> _Does InsWeb sell my information to other companies?_
> 
>     No. InsWeb never resells, trades, leases or rents the personally identifiable information of our users to other companies.
> 
> _Does InsWeb store my information?_
> 
>     Yes. All information submitted through InsWeb's quote request forms is stored on our servers. InsWeb does not use this information except to process your request to provide quotes, or with your permission: 
> 
>   * to forward it to an insurance company when you request coverage, and 
>   * to save in your personal account to make it convenient to come back. 
> 

> 
> _Does InsWeb allow me to correct the information?_
> 
>     Yes. You can change the information you provide at any time. Your right to review and correct information obtained from third parties, such as credit reports, is subject to a variety of federal and state laws.
> 
> _How does InsWeb protect my information as it passes over the Internet?_
> 
>     Our auto, homeowners, renters, individual health and term life quote request forms use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. With SSL, when you enter the InsWeb home page your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our servers. Encryption makes it exceedingly difficult for others to view your information. 
> 
> When you either request coverage from an insurance company that has offered an online quote, or request an offline quote, InsWeb transmits your information to the company you select. InsWeb offers encryption to each of its participating carriers, and requires carriers to employ it when receiving such information as Social Security numbers or credit card information.
> 
> _Does InsWeb use "cookies"?_
> 
>     Yes, some of InsWeb's pages do use "cookies" â€” one or more small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. InsWeb assigns a random number to each user and stores this number as a cookie on the user's computer. This allows InsWeb to correlate user activity throughout our site and track usage patterns.
