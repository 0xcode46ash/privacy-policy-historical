> 
> ## Q&A About Privacy
> 
> In order to make it easier to understand InsWeb's privacy policies, we've arranged this document in a question and answer format. 
> 
> _How does InsWeb use my personally identifiable information?_
> 
>     InsWeb uses your personally identifiable information to prepare your insurance profile. From this profile, InsWeb generates instant, online quotes (as available) using the rating methods of our participating insurance companies. If you meet their criteria, other participating insurance companies may offer to provide an offline quote. 
> 
> Unless you expressly give us permission to do so, or unless required by law, InsWeb does not willfully use or disclose personally identifiable information. However, we may share aggregated statistical information from our database with our participating insurance companies or business partners. Even in this case, individual users' personally identifiable information is not disclosed.
> 
> _How do InsWeb's participating insurance companies use my information?_
> 
>     InsWeb does not control the privacy practices of the participating insurance companies, however all of the companies use the information you provide for one general purpose: to provide you with an accurate insurance quote. Personally identifiable information such as name, address, or Social Security number is collected as part of the process of requesting a quote. Companies use your personally identifiable information in combination with other information you provide about your insurance needs. However, the rating criteria may be different for each participating insurance company and each company may place different emphasis on particular aspects of your information. Where permitted by law, your personally identifiable information may also be used to request a credit report or your claims history from a third party, or to verify other information you have provided.
> 
> _When do you send my information to an insurance company? Do I have control over this?_
> 
>     Yes, you always have total control over whether InsWeb sends your personally identifiable information to insurance companies, and to which companies this information is sent. To request coverage from a company that has offered an online quote, or to request an offline quote, you can choose to send your name, contact information, and the detailed information you provided on the quote request form to one or more insurance companies. In either case, this information is only sent at your direction.
> 
> _Why do some of InsWeb's quote request forms require so much information?_
> 
>     InsWeb works with many insurance companies. Since these companies use different criteria to rate prospective customers, the form must encompass a wide range of questions. The comprehensive form ensures that you receive the largest number of quotes for your particular circumstances. The consequence of declining to provide some requested information is that InsWeb may be unable to provide quotes from participating insurance companies.
> 
> _How can I change my information?_
> 
>     At any point while you are shopping for quotes, you can use the tabs to return to previous pages. To change the information displayed, type the new data in the form and click the **Continue** or **Submit** button found on the page. When you save your personal information to an InsWeb Account you can return any time you like to change the information entered while shopping for quotes. Simply log in on the site and you will have access to the personal information that you entered. To change the information displayed, type the new data in the form and click the **Continue** or **Submit** button found on the page. While you are logged in, each time you click the **Continue** or **Submit** button the latest personal information you entered is saved to our secure server. If you did not save your personal information you can send an email to our customer care department and request to have your account deleted. An email link is provided on most pages of our site and in the help section.
> 
> _How do I access my information?_
> 
>     To retrieve your previously entered information, select the Returning to InsWeb option on the first page of the quote request form or log in from the home page. After you enter your user name and password, you will be able to view the form containing the information you entered earlier. 
> 
> _After I request quotes at InsWeb, who will contact me?_
> 
>     If you request quotes or coverage at InsWeb, representatives of the companies you have selected will contact you with information regarding your quotes or coverage. You will only be contacted by these representatives if you specifically have requested it. 
> 
> In addition, InsWeb periodically e-mails a quality control survey to all customers who request quotes or coverage. These surveys are completely optional. 
> 
> _Does InsWeb sell my information to other companies?_
> 
>     No. InsWeb never resells, trades, leases or rents the personally identifiable information of our users to other companies.
> 
> _Does InsWeb store my information?_
> 
>     Yes. All information submitted through InsWeb's quote request forms is stored on our servers. InsWeb does not use your personally identifiable information except to process your request to provide quotes, or with your permission: 
> 
>   * to forward it to an insurance company when you request coverage, 
>   * to save in your InsWeb Account to make it convenient to come back, 
>   * to identify InsWeb Rewards offerings available to you, and 
>   * to send you e-mail. 
> 

> 
> _Does InsWeb allow me to correct the information?_
> 
>     Yes. You can change the information you provide at any time. Your right to review and correct information obtained from third parties, such as credit reports, is subject to a variety of federal and state laws.
> 
> _How does InsWeb protect my information as it passes over the Internet?_
> 
>     Our auto, homeowners, renters, individual health and term life quote request forms use the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) protocol. With SSL, when you enter the InsWeb home page your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our servers. Encryption makes it exceedingly difficult for others to view your information. 
> 
> When you either request coverage from an insurance company that has offered an online quote, or request an offline quote, InsWeb transmits your information to the company you select. InsWeb offers encryption to each of its participating carriers, and requires carriers to employ it when receiving such information as Social Security numbers or credit card information.
> 
> _What about information for Promotions?_
> 
>     InsWeb on its own, or jointly with other organizations and Web sites, may offer contests, sweepstakes, and promotions. You may be asked to supply certain personal information or consent to limited sharing of your information to participate in these promotional events, which may then be used by the sponsoring parties for marketing purposes. Even if you have previously opted not to receive information or mailings about InsWeb, you may still receive information about InsWeb via these promotions if you choose to register for them. Rules and guidelines for each promotion will be clearly posted, as will notification about how the information gathered may be used. You may opt not to participate in these special promotions if you do not want to receive information about InsWeb or share your information with all sponsoring parties. 
> 
> _Does InsWeb send e-mails and can I opt out?_
> 
>     When you save your information at our site you will be given the opportunity to receive information. If you choose to opt out of this choice when you save you will not receive this information. Our communications are usually delivered to our customers via e-mail. Your e-mail address may be provided to a trustworthy third party solely for this purpose. Our customers generally find the information helpful. You can choose not to receive this information by: 
> 
>   * Responding to the opt-out question when you save your data, 
>   * Following the instructions in the e-mail message you receive, 
>   * Clicking on "Contact Us" at the bottom of any InsWeb page, 
>   * Sending an e-mail to [customercare@insweb.com](mailto:customercare@insweb.com) or 
>   * Calling 1-800-871-5075. 
> 

> 
> _Does InsWeb use "cookies"?_
> 
>     InsWeb does not use "cookies". We may choose to do so in the future. Cookies are one or more small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser settings to prevent that. InsWeb may also detect the type of operating system, internet browser and e-mail client (program for accessing emails) each time you visit the site. This allows InsWeb to notify you of potential problems with our applications and certain operating system-internet browser combinations. Determining the e-mail client in use allows InsWeb to send communications that are compatible with your system.
> 
> _Does InsWeb collect information from Children under the age of 13?_

>     InsWeb does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
