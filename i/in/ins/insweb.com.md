**

Does InsWeb send e-mails, and can I opt out?

**

 **Communications.** When you provide your contact information to InsWeb, you will periodically receive communications from us. Our communications are usually delivered via e-mail. Our customers generally find the information helpful. However, you can choose not to receive this information by: 



  * Following the instructions in the e-mail message you receive,

**Advertising.** If you would like to unsubscribe from receiving e-mail advertisements from InsWeb, you can either follow the instructions in the advertisement itself, or simply [click here](http://insweb.in2uc.com/unsub/unsub.form?id=0d090988c424558c1fb5c887f2500e0c).

**

What do sites that have links from InsWeb do with my information?

**

Please be aware that Websites that have links on our site may collect personal information about you. When you click on one of these links, you are being transferred to another Website. In some instances, the website you are transferred to will be co-branded with the InsWeb mark. No personal information is shared with InsWeb and InsWeb does not share personal information with the co-branded site. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these linked sites (including any co-branded versions) as their privacy policies may differ from ours. This privacy statement does not cover the information practices of websites linked to the InsWeb site. 

**

How does InsWeb obtain testimonials?

**

Testimonials also exist on our web site. Before we publicly place testimonials on the site, we receive expressed written consent from the individual to place not only his/her words, but also his/her name and hometown on the web site. 

**

What is a blog?

**

A weblog (“blog”) is a series of text, images, media objects and data, arranged chronologically, that can be viewed in a web browser. InsWeb maintains a blog at [http://blog.insweb.com](http://blog.insweb.com/), and you may submit content for review and possible posting on our blog. Because InsWeb uses third-party blogging software, InsWeb will not have access to your email address or other personally identifiable address. However, if you submit your real name to InsWeb for attribution to a particular blog message you authored, InsWeb may display your name in our blog. 

**

What is framing?

**

Framing is a term used to describe the way a web page is presented. When InsWeb presents you with a "framed" web page, you will see InsWeb's branding elements alongside the branding elements of the non-affiliated third party with which InsWeb has contracted to provide a particular insurance product, set of services and/or particular set of web pages. Although InsWeb does incorporate framing in order to provide you with more products and services, you will always be notified before leaving the InsWeb site. And while you may still see InsWeb's URL in the address line, the framed site and not InsWeb will collect all personally identifiable information you enter. We encourage you to read the privacy statement on a framed page carefully as this privacy statement may differ in substance from InsWeb's privacy statement. 

**

How does InsWeb protect my information as it passes over the Internet?

**

With SSL, when you enter a request for quotes or provide personal information on one of our website properties, your information is encrypted as it travels between your computer and our computer servers. To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. We recommend using a strong encryption, 128-bit browser. Netscape Navigator 4.06 or higher and Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.01 or higher are 128-bit browsers. You can tell when you are visiting a secure area in our site by looking at the symbol on the bottom of your browser screen. If you are using Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, you will see either a lock or a key. When the symbol appears unbroken or the padlock is in the locked position, your session connection is taking place via a secure server. 

All personal information submitted to InsWeb and AgentInsider (including personal health and credit card information) is encrypted. 

**

Does InsWeb use "cookies"?

**

Cookies are small text files saved on your computer's hard drive and stored in memory while your browser is running. InsWeb uses cookies to help make it easier for returning users to log in and complete one of our quote forms. While our use of cookies should make your online experience easier, it is our policy not to use cookies to track, collect, or store your personally identifiable information. If you feel uncomfortable accepting cookies, you can change your browser settings to prevent cookies from being saved to your hard drive. 

InsWeb contracts with certain partners to display third-party banner advertisements on the InsWeb Website. These partners utilize ad-serving technology. To gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements, these companies may place a cookie on your computer when you view Web pages where these ads appear, or when you click on the ads. These third-party cookies enable the companies to recognize certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's IP address, browser version type, operating system, Internet service provider, and time zone. The collection of this aggregated user information helps our partners improve the effectiveness of the advertising by delivering ads that they believe will be of most interest to you, and minimize the repetition of ads you see. Although the information collected using these cookies does not directly recognize your personally identifiable information, third parties may be able to associate the cookie information with your personally identifiable information if you registered for a product or service on their site. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of these third party sites as their privacy policies may differ from ours. 

**

Does InsWeb use Web beacons?

**

Some pages on our Site, as well as pages where our banner ads appear, and certain emails we send, may contain electronic images known as Web beacons, or single-pixel GIFs. These Web beacons collect certain types of non-personally identifiable information, such as a visitor's cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page where the Web beacon is placed. Our partners use Web beacons to compile aggregated statistics that help us improve the effectiveness of our advertising and make our Site easier to use. The information collected using these Web beacons does not identify individual users of our Site. 

**

Does InsWeb log my movements?

**

InsWeb logs both consumer movements through our site and consumer search requests. This data is used to analyze trends, gather demographic information for aggregate use, and help administer the site. We do not use these technologies to capture or share your individual email address or any personally identifying information about you. 

Each time you visit our site, we may detect the type of operating system, Internet browser, and email client you use (program for accessing emails). This allows us to notify you of potential problems with our applications and certain operating system Internet browser combinations. Determining the email client in use lets us send communications that are compatible with your system. 

**

Does InsWeb collect information from children under the age of 13?

**

InsWeb does not knowingly solicit data from children, and we do not knowingly market to children.
