# Insureon - Privacy Statement - How We Treat Your Personal & Business Information

At Insureon we value you as a customer. We also share your concerns about privacy. We are providing this statement to explain how we treat your personal and business information ("customer information") that is not public. This is information we obtain from you or from other sources when we provide you with products and services.

We want you to know that we respect your privacy; and we protect your information.

  * We do not sell customer information.
  * We do not share your information with persons, companies, or organizations outside Insureon that would use that information to contact you about their own products and services.
  * We expect persons or organizations that provide services on our behalf to keep your information confidential.
  * We also expect those persons or organizations to use your information only to provide the services we've asked them to provide.
  * We communicate to our employees about the need to protect your information. We have established safeguards (these are physical, electronic and procedural) to protect this information.



Below are answers to questions you might have about privacy. You may be wondering...

## What do we do with your information?

Insureon does not sell your personal or business information to anyone. We do not share it with companies or organizations outside of Insureon that would use that information to contact you about their own products and services. If that practice were ever to change, we would offer you the ability to opt out of this type of information sharing.

We may also use your information to help you with your insurance needs. We may also communicate with you about products, features, and options in which you have expressed an interest. Without your consent, we may provide your information to persons or organizations in and out of Insureon. This would be done as permitted or required by law. We may do this to:

  * Fulfill a transaction you have requested.
  * Service your policy.
  * Market our products to you.
  * Investigate or handle claims.
  * Detect or prevent fraud.
  * Comply with lawful requests from regulatory and law enforcement authorities.



These persons or organizations may include:

  * Our affiliated companies.
  * Companies that perform services, including marketing, on our behalf.
  * Other agencies with which we have an agreement for the sale of financial products.
  * Insurance companies to perform their role in an insurance transaction involving you.
  * Persons requesting information pursuant to a subpoena or court order.



## What kind of customer information do we have, and where did we get it?

Much of the information that we have about you comes from you. When you perform certain transactions, you may give us information such as your name, address and Social Security or business Federal Employer ID Number (FEIN). These transactions include when you submit an application for insurance, submit a request for products and services we offer, or submit a request for an insurance quote. We keep information about the types of services you purchase from us and our affiliates. Examples of this include premiums, account balances, and payment history. The insurance companies we work with may collect information for outside sources, such as business reporting agencies. This information may include loss information reports and business credit reports.

## How do we protect your customer information?

We expect any company with whom we share your information to use it only to provide the service we have asked them to perform. Information about you is also available within Insureon to those individuals who may need to use it to fulfill and service the needs of our customers. We communicate the need to protect your information to all employees and agents. We especially communicate this need to individuals who have access to it. Plus, we have established physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your information. Note that if you relationship with us ends, you information will remain protected. This protection will be provided according to our privacy practices outlined in this statement.
