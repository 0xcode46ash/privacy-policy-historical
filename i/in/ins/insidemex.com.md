**Cookies and Web Beacons**

Insidemex.com, like many websites, uses cookies to prepare customized Web pages for you. A cookie is a file containing a string of code that we transfer to your computer's hard drive, to be kept there for later use. With cookies in place, whenever you use your Web browser (such as Internet Explorer, AOL or Mozilla Firefox) to connect to Insidemex.com, our systems are able to recognize you. This enables Insidemex.com to present you with custom Web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you see a welcome page with your name on it and information that relates to where you live (your ZIP code) and products or services that reflect your interests. 

In addition to Insidemex.com's cookies, when you visit Insidemex.com your computer may receive cookies from our advertisers and from other sites displayed as search results or links.

This enables us to assess the popularity and effectiveness of the material posted on the Insidemex.com website. We may also use web beacons in connection with e-mails sent to Insidemex.com members, to let us know whether and when the e-mail was opened. No personal information is transmitted through web beacons.
