# InsideHook | Travel, News, Health & Fashion for Men in New York, LA, SF, Chicago & the Nation

Escapist Media Inc., the owner of InsideHook, appreciates your trust in letting us into your inbox, and as such takes the private nature of your personal information very seriously. InsideHook’s goal is to provide you with relevant information tailored to your individual needs, while at the same time protecting the privacy you justifiably value. This privacy policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Web site, register for our daily email, and/or sign up for a mobile product. Please be sure to read this notice carefully.

 **Personal Information:** To receive your InsideHook emails, all we require is your email address. So that we may provide you with additional services and also content that is more interesting and relevant to you in particular, we may also request additional information such as your name, age, telephone number, or zip code. InsideHook does not collect any personally identifiable information that you do not expressly provide.

 **Nonpersonal Information:** We may also request nonpersonally identifiable information, such as annual income, shopping preferences or age. This information is known as demographic and profile data, and is 100% optional. If you choose to share it, this data may be used to improve our site and/or tailor your experience, by delivering you content that we think might be of interest to you and displaying it according to your preferences. We may share this information with others, such as advertisers interested in InsideHook , but never on a personal level. This information would only be shared in aggregate, anonymous form, such as letting an advertiser know the average age of an InsideHook reader. No third party will ever receive information from us that personally identifies you or any other person in any way.

 **Log Files:** Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. These include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement.

 **Review and Access:** Upon your request, we will be happy to provide you with a summary of the information we collect about you. You will have the opportunity to correct, update or modify any of this information.

 **Choice/Opt-Out:** If we ever send you information by email concerning new products or services that you did not expressly request, InsideHook will provide you with an email address by which you may request no future notices.

 **How we share personal information**

 **Sharing for Services Administration:** We may provide your information to our affiliates or to service providers for purposes related to Services administration. If you use a credit or debit card to complete a transaction through our services, we may share your personal information and credit card number with a credit card processing and/or a fulfillment company in order to complete your transaction, or such service provider(s) may collect that information from you directly, on our behalf.

 **Sharing for Additional Content, Products and Services:** We also make some content, products and services available through cooperative relationships with service providers, where the brands of our service provider appear in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our service provider any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our service provider.

If you do not wish certain information to be shared for these purposes, please contact us at [tips@insidehook.com](mailto:tips@insidehook.com).

 **Sharing Information for Advertising and Other Promotional Purposes:** We may use service providers and third-party advertising service providers to target and serve some of the advertisements you see through InsideHook. We may share your information, or technical or aggregate information, with service providers, third-party advertising service providers, our affiliates, third parties and advertisers for their use in displaying ads through our Services or for other promotional purposes, including displaying ads on other sites and apps. The technical or aggregate information may be based on data that includes your information and such items as type of pages viewed and categories of interest. These service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers may use their own browser or flash cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to collect technical information (such as Device unique identifier, IP address, MAC address, browser type, pages visited, and location information) that is generated automatically as a user views or interacts with an ad. These service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers may use that information, sometimes in conjunction with similar information gathered through other websites and other sources, to deliver advertisements through InsideHook or for other promotional purposes. They also may use that information to deliver advertisements, or for other promotional purposes, on other websites, as well as on other websites that participate in our third-party advertising service providers’ advertising networks, which are tailored to match the perceived interests of consumers. The information obtained by service providers, third-party advertising service providers, affiliates, third parties and advertisers also may be used to help measure and research an advertisement’s effectiveness, or for other purposes.

If you do not wish certain information to be shared for these purposes, please contact us at [tips@insidehook.com](mailto:tips@insidehook.com).

 **Sharing for Other Purposes:** Please be aware that we may occasionally release information about you if required to do so by law or if, in our business judgment, such disclosure is reasonably necessary: (a) to comply with legal process; (b) to enforce our Terms of Service or (c) to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of our services, us, our affiliates, our officers, directors, employees, representatives, our licensors, other users, and/or the public.

Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. If we sell some or all of our assets, or InsideHook is acquired by another company, information collected about InsideHook's users may be among the transferred assets.

 **Links to Other Sites:** In our quest to bring you the most relevant, actionable content possible, InsideHook may create links allowing you to access third-party sites. InsideHook is not responsible for the content that appears on those sites and does not necessarily endorse these sites. Please consult those sites’ individual privacy policies in order to determine how they treat user information.

 **Security:** All information described above is stored on restricted database servers.

 **Deletion of Account:** Should you ever decide to delete your InsideHook account, you may do so by unsubscribing. If you terminate your account, any association between your account and information InsideHook stores will no longer be accessible through your account.

 **Modification to This Policy:** InsideHook reserves the right to modify this policy, but in the event we do so we will maintain complete transparency — any changes to the policy will be immediately posted here, so be sure to check back for future information.

 **Contact Us:** If you have any questions about this policy or our site in general, please contact [tips@insidehook.com](mailto:tips@insidehook.com).
