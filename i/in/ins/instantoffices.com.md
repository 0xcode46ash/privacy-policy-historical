#####  Where we store your personal data

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy and cookie policy.

All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers. Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL technology. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone.

Due to the nature of the internet, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

We use information held about you in the following ways:

  * To allow you to participate in interactive features of our service, when you choose to do so.

  * To notify you about changes to our service.




We may also use your data, or permit selected third parties and our partners to use your data, to provide you with information about goods and services which may be of interest to you and we or they may contact you about these by post or telephone. Our partners will be landlords or operators with properties in the same area as you are seeking premises – they may contact you about properties in the same area as your enquiry for a period until you tell us or them that you are no longer looking. The selected third parties who may contact you will be providers of goods and services related to acquiring business premises, for example (but not limited to) fit-out companies, commercial property agents and IT equipment suppliers.

If you are an existing customer, we will only contact you by electronic means (e-mail or SMS) with information about goods and services similar to those which were the subject of your enquiry. 

If you are a new customer, and where we permit selected third parties and our partners to use your data, we (or they) will contact you by electronic means only if you have consented to this. 

If you do not want us to use your data in this way, please tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data (the registration form).

#####  Disclosure of your information

  * If Instant Offices Limited or substantially all of its assets are acquired by a third party, in which case personal data held by it about its customers will be one of the transferred assets.

  * If we are under a duty to disclose or share your personal data in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our [ terms of use](https://web.archive.org/web/20130622201214id_/http://www.instantoffices.com/terms-of-website-use.aspx) and other agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Instant Offices Limited, our customers, or others.
