Insight will notify its registered users of any changes in the use or collection of their personally identifiable information via email prior to changes being made.

**Third-Party Sites**  
This site contains links to other sites.  Insight is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control.  All account information you use or supply on Insight's Web site when ordering or tracking products is secure. We use advanced encryption technology to protect you from unauthorized use of information supplied on our Web site.

Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is an industry standard security protocol used to encode sensitive information such as credit card numbers that pass between your personal computer and Insight's e-Commerce site. SSL works by creating a temporary, shared "key" or session that lets only the computers on either end of a transmission scramble and unscramble information. The SSL transmission is indecipherable by any individuals or servers that relay the message between the sender and the receiver. When your web browser enters Insight's secure Web site, our server hosting the site acknowledges your web browser with a "server hello." In return, your browser responds with a "client hello." This communication allows for the browser and server to determine the level of encryption they both support and will use. Once "hellos" are exchanged, your browser will ask for Insight's "digital certificate." The certificate acts as our "commerce ID" to ensure you that the transactions are between you and Insight. Companies receive digital certificates from a Certificate Authority, such as RSA Data Security Inc. or VerSign Inc. A Certificate Authority verifies a company's identification and then issues a unique certificate as proof of identity.  Next the browser and the server create a "master key." This master key is a codebook that both sides use to encode and decode transmissions. Only your browser and our server share that master key which is good only for that particular session. The unique key allows your browser and our server to exchange sensitive information in a way third parties can't understand.  Once your transactions are complete and you leave our secure site, the master key you once held with the server becomes useless. When you reenter the secure site, the hello, digital certificate and master key process start over again.
