### Privacy Statement

InjuryBoard.com aims to be your most trusted guide to personal injury legal and medical information on the Internet. In order to earn your trust, we at InjuryBoard.com would like to inform you of our policies and procedures as they relate to your privacy.

First and foremost, InjuryBoard.com and its management are intimately aware of, and have the utmost respect for, your privacy. The confidential nature of your communications with InjuryBoard.com and our member firms will always be respected.

Since InjuryBoard.com is not a lawyer referral service nor a law firm, employees and managers of InjuryBoard.com will not evaluate the merits of your case. Rather, we will forward your inquiry to an InjuryBoard.com member firm.

As is true of all licensed attorneys, a duty of confidentiality governs attorneys associated with InjuryBoard.com. State bar associations from around the United States enforce this duty of confidentiality. The duty of confidentiality prohibits attorneys from revealing your confidential information to others. The American Bar Association defines the duty of confidentiality as follows:

_Rule 1.6 Confidentiality of Information_  
(a) A lawyer shall not reveal information relating to representation of a client unless the client consents after consultation, except for disclosures that are impliedly authorized in order to carry out the representation, and except as stated in paragraph (b).

(b) A lawyer may reveal such information to the extent the lawyer reasonably believes necessary:

(1) to prevent the client from committing a criminal act that the lawyer believes is likely to result in imminent death or substantial bodily harm; or

(2) to establish a claim or defense on behalf of the lawyer in a controversy between the lawyer and the client, to establish a defense to a criminal charge or civil claim against the lawyer based upon conduct in which the client was involved, or to respond to allegations in any proceeding concerning the lawyer's representation of a client.

Since InjuryBoard.com is neither a lawyer referral service nor a law firm, we are not subject to the duty of confidentiality. However, as stated above, we will not reveal any of your private or confidential communications or other information to any outside source (except for InjuryBoard.com member law firms and attorneys affiliated with members of InjuryBoard.com) without your explicit permission.

There are two basic ways that InjuryBoard.com may learn more about you. The first way, and perhaps most important, is through information that you supply to us through the free "Ask an Attorney" feature or by signing up for our Newsletter. Again, as described above, we will not reveal or sell any of the information that you voluntarily supply through these features to any entity unaffiliated with InjuryBoard.com or our attorney members.

We may also collect certain general information through the use of "cookies," which are an integral part of browser technology and are used extensively throughout the Internet. Cookies allow InjuryBoard.com to customize our site to more adequately reflect your needs and preferences. Cookies simply associate a particular computer with certain characteristics. They do not gather personal or confidential information. For instance, a cookie will never know your name, address, telephone number, social security number, or any other similar information.

While we respect and honor your privacy, InjuryBoard.com reserves the right to alter this privacy policy without notice.

  


### Disclaimer

InjuryBoard.com is the leading personal injury legal site for consumers. However, InjuryBoard.com is neither a law firm nor a legal referral service nor a doctor's office. As such, this site should not be used as a substitute for an attorney's advice or a medical doctor's diagnosis.

InjuryBoard.com provides extensive legal, health, injury and medical information. However, we cannot provide specific medical or legal advice. Instead, the information we provide is general in nature.

If you are concerned with a specific medical condition, we urge you to seek a doctor's advice. We cannot provide such medical advice to you. Additionally, if you have a specific legal problem, we encourage you to contact an attorney. As laws vary from state to state and are constantly changing, only a licensed attorney can provide you with specific legal advice.

Each section of the InjuryBoard.com site has a link that allows you to contact one of our member firms free of charge. By contacting a member firm, you have not entered into an attorney/client relationship. Such a relationship can only be established after both parties have signed a written document. Should you enter into an attorney/client relationship with an InjuryBoard.com member firm, InjuryBoard.com does not receive any portion of the attorneys' or law firms' fees.

InjuryBoard.com is not responsible for the actions and/or inactions of our member firms, nor can we guarantee your satisfaction. Furthermore, we do not necessarily recommend that you retain the services of our member firms. Certain state bar associations may consider an InjuryBoard.com membership to be a form of advertising. The hiring of a lawyer is an important decision that should not be based solely on advertisement. Such a decision should only be made after the review and careful consideration of a firm's experience and qualifications.

While we make every reasonable effort to provide useful, timely and accurate information, we cannot guarantee the correctness of this information, nor can we guarantee that we carry information on every conceivable injury subject. In addition, while we closely monitor government initiated product recalls, we may from time to time be unaware of certain recalls and safety alerts.
