# Privacy Policy | iOSnoops

This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by TechSnoops LLC (“TechSnoops”). TechSnoops operates several websites, including – but not limited to – iOSnoops.com. It is TechSnoops’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please feel free to contact us via our [contact page](http://www.iosnoops.com/contact-us/).

### Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At TechSnoops, we have a few fundamental principles:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, TechSnoops collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. TechSnoops’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how TechSnoops’s visitors use its website. From time to time, TechSnoops may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

TechSnoops also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on its blogs. TechSnoops only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to TechSnoops’s websites choose to interact with TechSnoops in ways that require TechSnoops to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that TechSnoops gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who leave comments at iOSnoops.com to provide a name and email address. TechSnoops collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with TechSnoops’ properties. TechSnoops does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

TechSnoops may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, TechSnoops may monitor the most popular posts and/or comments on the iOSnoops.com site. TechSnoops may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, TechSnoops does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

TechSnoops discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on TechSnoops’s behalf or to provide services available at TechSnoops’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using TechSnoops’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. TechSnoops will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, TechSnoops discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when TechSnoops believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of TechSnoops, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of a TechSnoops website and have supplied your email address, TechSnoops may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with TechSnoops and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users (however, in this specific case, your email address will not be published). TechSnoops takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by TechSnoops and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Comments

Comments left by users on TechSnoops’ websites are the sole responsibility of the person posting them. You agree not to post comments that are off topic, defamatory, obscene, abusive, threatening, considered “spam”, or an invasion of privacy. Violators may be banned.

Although most changes are likely to be minor, TechSnoops may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in TechSnoops’s sole discretion.
