_Last Updated: 5 February 2013_

inMusic Brands, Inc. (“inMusic”) has created this Privacy Policy Statement in order to inform you of our commitment to privacy and to describe our policies for the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information that may be collected by InMusic when you use our products or visit our websites. 

PLEASE REVIEW THIS PRIVACY POLICY BEFORE USING THIS OR ANY OTHER ION AUDIO PRODUCT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, DO NOT USE OUR PRODUCTS. WHERE APPLICABLE, BY SUBMITTING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION TO US, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY STATEMENT.

## GENERAL INFORMATION

Generally speaking, you may use our products while remaining anonymous and not revealing any personal information. From time to time, a hardware product of ours may communicate with one or more software applications on your computer or mobile device for the purpose of providing its stated functionality to you; e.g. an image scanner sends scanned photographs to your photo library, or a record player digitizes the audio on an LP and sends it to an application on your computer or mobile device for editing and archiving. However, at no time do our products transmit any personally identifying information to the computer or mobile device.

## Submission and Use of Personal Information

In order to register your product and be eligible for warranty service and support, we may require that you submit some personal information to us for the purposes of identifying you and details about your product if you contact our service and support department.

In addition to the usage of your submitted personal information for providing service and support, inMusic uses information it collects to provide the services and information you select, to better understand its customers, to provide better products and services, and (in the case of submission online) to assist with site administration, such as with troubleshooting any problems, detecting fraud, resolving disputes, and for any purposes deemed necessary or required by inMusic to enforce the Terms of Use and other terms or conditions applicable to any portion of our websites.

We may also use this information to send you information about inMusic, our products and brands, services, or other topics inMusic thinks may be of interest to you, such as brand, product and service information or updates.

We do not share any personal information collected from our customers with any non-affiliated third parties (except as outlined in the “Law Enforcement” section below), nor do we sell any personal information collected from our customers for any purpose whatsoever.
