# iolo technologies Privacy Policy

This Privacy Statement applies to iolo technologies, LLC ("iolo") and its worldwide corporate affiliates ("we", "our" or "us"). This Privacy Statement does not apply to the products or websites of our business partners or to any other third parties, even if their products or websites are linked to or from our website. We recommend you review the privacy statements of the other parties with whom you interact. 

This Privacy Statement governs personal information we collect from our customers and online from our website users ("you"), through our products, services, software, websites, contacts or our relationships with you. 

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, "corporate affiliates" means any entity or joint venture that is wholly or partially owned or controlled by iolo technologies, LLC. "Business partners" means any subcontractor, vendor or other entity with whom we have an ongoing business relationship to provide products, services, or information. "Personal information" means information which identifies you, such as your name, telephone number, and e-mail address. 

####  Information We Collect

We may ask you to provide personal information when you

  * Use our website;

  * Request services, support, or information;
  * Place orders for products or product subscription activation keys;
  * Participate in surveys, sweepstakes, or other promotional activities;
  * Subscribe to newsletters, promotional e-mails, or other materials; or

If you make an order, we may ask for your home address, telephone number, credit card number and billing information. Job applicants may be requested to provide information such as educational background, employment experience and job interest. If you contact us for e-mail technical support, we may ask you for information on which product you are using, which version of Windows you are using, the nature of your issue, and any other information pertinent to the support request. If you use our products, in addition to your name and e-mail address, we will also receive technical information regarding your computer specifications. We may also collect your business or company information, title or department and other information (including demographic information). Any forms that you may fill in will indicate whether information requested is mandatory or voluntary. 

You can browse the iolo website without creating an account, but you may need to create an account when you purchase something. When you create an account at iolo.com, you can choose to save your billing and shipping information in the "My Account / View or Modify My Account Information" section of the iolo website. You may log in to your account to change or delete this saved information anytime.

We may collect information about your visits to our websites, including the pages you view, the links you click, search terms you enter and other actions you take in connection with the iolo websites and services. We may also collect certain information from the browser you used to come to our website, such as your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type and language, access times, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that referred you to our website and to which URL you browse away from our site if you click on a link on our site.

When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mails from iolo, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click. The data is used to help us determine the effectiveness of our communications with you, and to provide you with more focused communications.

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with iolo, information collected through one source may be combined with information obtained through other iolo resources. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other parties as well.

Some iolo services or products may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services or products, both iolo and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services or products, and may use the information according to each company's privacy statement and other agreements with you.

####  How We Use Your Personal Information

iolo uses your personal and technical information to:

  * Deliver the services and support, or carry out the transactions you have requested. 
  * Send communications to you, such as your transactions status (for example, order confirmations), information about products and services available from iolo and its corporate affiliates, promotional offers, newsletters, and surveys.
  * Customize, analyze, and improve our products, services (including our website), technologies, communications and relationship with you.
  * Enforce our conditions of sale, website terms and/or separate contracts (if applicable) with you.
  * Prevent fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities.



Personal information collected may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which iolo or its corporate affiliates, subsidiaries, agents or service providers maintain facilities, and by using iolo products and services, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

####  Disclosing Personal Information

We may share your personal information with corporate affiliates to carry out transactions you request or to make our business or that of our corporate affiliates more responsive to your needs. We may also disclose your personal information in connection with law enforcement, fraud prevention, or other legal action; as required by law or regulation; or if iolo reasonably believes it is necessary to protect iolo, its customers or the public. In addition, we may share your personal information with business partners that help iolo carry out transactions you request or that help iolo to customize, analyze and/or improve our communications or relationship with you, and then only with business partners who share iolo's commitment to protecting your personal information. Except as described above, we will not disclose your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes unless you have provided consent.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy products, subsidiaries, or business units. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy (unless, of course, you consent otherwise). Also, in the event that iolo, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

####  How You Can Access Your Information

To view or edit your personal information that has been stored online, please visit the "My Account / View or Modify My Account Information" section of the iolo.com website.

####  How We Secure Your Personal Information

iolo is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure, such as encryption, passwords, physical security, etc. While we strive to protect your personal information, iolo cannot ensure or warrant that the personal information or private communications you transmit to us will always remain private, and you do so at your own risk.

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users.

If you are visiting from the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from United States law, including those whose privacy laws may be more strict than United States law, please note that you are transferring your personal information to the United States to iolo, where it will be stored. By providing your personal information you consent to such transfer and storage of personal information in the United States (or any other region outside the European Union where such personal information may be stored). iolo will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.

####  Collection and Use of Children's Personal Information

iolo takes children's privacy seriously. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 through our websites.

If you are under 18 years of age, please do not submit any personal information through our websites without the express consent and participation of a parent or guardian.

####  How We Use Cookies 

iolo websites use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. We use cookies to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these websites.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of iolo websites and services that depend on cookies.

####  How We Use Web Beacons 

We, or third parties with whom we have contracted or sub contracted, may use web beacons on our website, in our e-mails, in our advertisements on other websites, or in our advertisements in others' e-mails. A web beacon is an electronic image that can be used to recognize a cookie on your computer when you view a web page or e-mail. Web beacons help us measure the effectiveness of our website and our advertising in various ways, for example, by counting the number of individuals who visit our website from a particular advertisement or make a purchase from our website after viewing a particular advertisement as well as by telling us when a web page is viewed and providing a description of the page where the web beacon is placed. Web beacons also help us measure the effectiveness of our e-mail campaigns, for example, by counting the number of individuals who open or act upon an e-mail message, determining when an e-mail message is opened and determining how many times an e-mail message is forwarded.

The information we collect may include some limited personal information, and web beacons allow us to recognize users by accessing iolo cookies. We may also combine the information that we collect through web beacons with other personal information we have collected from you. We use all of this information to better tailor our marketing to you and may use this information for other purposes, such as to enable a shopping cart, customize content on our website and undertake internal research.

We may allow third parties to compile individual information or aggregated statistics from our use of web beacons to enable such third parties to determine the effectiveness of online marketing and to allow such third parties to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. Aggregate information is anonymous and may include demographic and usage information. 

You can make some web beacons unusable by rejecting cookies.

####  Third-Party Websites and Services

Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our website may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party websites linked to or from iolo.com are not covered by this Privacy Statement.

Please be aware that, in providing services on iolo's behalf, our business partners may collect personal information about you.

####  Changes to Our Global Privacy Statement Regarding Customer and Online User Information 

We will occasionally update this Privacy Statement. When we post changes to this Privacy Statement, we will revise the Effective Date at the end of this paragraph. If there are material changes to this Privacy Statement or in how iolo will use your personal information, we will notify you by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how iolo is protecting your personal information.

Effective Date: March 1, 2009.
