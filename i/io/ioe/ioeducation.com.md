# Privacy Policy - IO Education

#### **IO Education is committed to your Privacy.**

IO Education, LLC (“IO Education,” “we,” or “us”) understands that privacy is tremendously important to our online visitors to our website (“Website Visitors”), to school districts and schools who purchase our Service (“Districts”), and to educators and students whose information we may access on behalf of a District (“Educators” and “Students”). IO Education provides a platform that enables Districts to integrate data from their various solutions and products and securely store that data in one consolidated location. Educators and school administrators can then more efficiently use this data to analyze performance and assist them with individualized success plans to drive achievement and performance. As we describe below, Districts decide which data are integrated with IO Education, and Districts are responsible for determining whether data are ever shared with the IO Education performance management platform. This privacy policy applies to our website [https://www.ioeducation.com](https://www.ioeducation.com/) and to all of our products and services (our “Service”) and describes the steps we take to protect your data.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given them in our [Terms of Service.](http://ioeducation.com/terms/)

> #### Transparency. We will always be transparent with the methods we use to collect data and describe exactly how we will use it to the benefit and strict direction of our School District clients.

### 1\. HOW WE COLLECT AND USE INFORMATION

We collect the following types of information:

Information about Districts and Schools: We ask for certain information when a District administrator, Educator or other user registers with IO Education, or if the user corresponds with us online, which may include a name, school name, school district name, school email address and/or account name and password, phone number, and/or message content. We may also retain information provided by a District or School if the District or Schools sends us a message, posts content to our website or through our Service, or responds to emails or surveys. Once a District begins using the IO Education Service, we will keep records of activities related to the Service. We use this information to operate, maintain, and provide to the features and functionality of the Service, to monitor our Service offerings and functionality, and to communicate with our Districts and website visitors.

Student Data: IO Education may have access to personally identifiable information about students (“Student Data”) in the course of providing its services to a District. We consider Student Data to be confidential and do not use such data for any purpose other than to provide the services on the District’s behalf. In most instances, IO Education receives Student Data only from the District and never interacts with the Student directly. In some instances, depending on the level of IO Education’s Service selected by the District, the Schools may allow Students to log into the IO Education Service to provide data such as surveys that have been authorized and directed by the District. In that instance, the District provides each student with login credentials and confirms that it has obtained appropriate parental consents, as needed, before the student is permitted to access the Service. IO Education has access to Student Data only as requested by the District and only for the purposes of performing Services on the District’s behalf.

Information collected through technology: We automatically collect certain types of usage information when visitors view our website or use our service. We may send one or more cookies — a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets IO Education help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie may also convey information to us about how you use the Service (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on the Service), and allow us to track your usage of the Service over time. We may collect log file information from your browser or mobile device each time you access the Service. Log file information may include anonymous information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, information about your mobile device, number of clicks and how you interact with links on the Service, pages viewed, and other such information. We may employ clear gifs (also known as web beacons), which are used to anonymously track the online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Districts to track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service. We may also collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service. We do not allow third party advertising networks to collect information about the users of our Site or Service.

We use or may use the data collected through cookies, log files, device identifiers, and clear gifs information to: (a) remember information so that a user will not have to re-enter it during subsequent visits; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) to provide and monitor the effectiveness of our Service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, traffic, and usage on our website and our Service; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems; and (f) help users efficiently access information after signing in.

_Student privacy is very important to us. Student Data are used only for educational purposes at the discretion of the District._

### 2\. HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION

IO Education only shares personal information in a few limited circumstances, described below. We do not rent or sell information for marketing purposes.

Who we may share information with:

  * We may share information with those that provide us with technology services (e.g. web hosting and analytics services), but strictly for the purpose of carrying out their work for us.
  * We may be required to share information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations, to enforce our [Terms of Service](http://ioeducation.com/terms/), or if we believe in good faith that the disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users.
  * In the event of a change of control: If we sell, divest or transfer the business or a portion of our business, we may transfer information, provided that the new provider has agreed to data privacy standards no less stringent than our own. We may also transfer personal information – under the same conditions – in the course of mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions, reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or proceedings involving all or a portion of our business.



How Student Data are shared: In addition to the actions described above, IO Education may facilitate the sharing of Student Data with third parties, though only when instructed and authorized to do so on behalf of the District. IO Education does not facilitate the sharing of any Student Data with third parties on the Service except on behalf of the District after the District has authorized a third party or application to access Student Data through the Service.

We store our data in the United States and we take strong measures to keep data safe and secure.

### 3\. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION

Storage and processing: Any information collected through the Service is stored and processed in the United States. If you use our Service outside of the United States, you consent to have your data transferred to the United States.

Keeping your information safe: IO Education maintains strict administrative, technical and physical procedures to protect information stored in our servers, which are located in the United States. Access to information is limited (through user/password credentials and two factor authentication) to those employees who require it to perform their job functions. We use industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology to safeguard the account registration process and sign-up information. Other security safeguards include but are not limited to data encryption, firewalls, and physical access controls to building and files.

We may maintain anonymized or aggregated data, including usage data, for analytics purposes. If you have any questions about data retention or deletion, please contact [support@ioeducation.com](mailto:support@ioeducation.com).

We do not collect any information from students.

### 5\. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

IO Education does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13 unless the District has obtained appropriate parental consent for the student to use the Service. Please contact us at [support@ioeducation.com](mailto:support@ioeducation.com) if you believe we have inadvertently collected personal information of a child under 13 without proper parental consents so that we may delete such data as soon as possible.

### 6\. LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES AND SERVICES
