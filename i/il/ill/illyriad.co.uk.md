[Illyriad](https://web.archive.org/) [About Illyriad Games](https://web.archive.org/Home/AboutIllyriadGames) Privacy Policy 

## Welcome to Illyriad Games’ Privacy Policy

Hi there, we’re Illyriad Games Ltd (a Limited Liability Company, registered in England & Wales, with a company number of 6969057), located at 563 Chiswick High Rd, London W4 3AY, UK (“ **Illyriad Games** ”) and welcome to our exciting and fun privacy policy! Being a UK-based company, and the UK is currently part of the European Economic Area (EEA), this policy is in accordance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”). 

We’ve written this policy in plain English and have given examples of what each part means where an example might be helpful.

This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if you’re an Illyriad player or visitor to our Sites. It applies across both the Illyriad and Age of Ascent games, forums &  general websites (the “ **Sites** ”).

  * When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or ‘Illyriad Games’ it’s because that is who we are, and we own and run the Sites.
  * If we say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. 
  * If we say ‘terms & conditions’, we’re talking about each Sites’ Terms & Conditions, linked from the bottom of each site (for [Illyriad, click here](http://www.illyriad.co.uk/Home/TermsConditions); for [Age of Ascent, click here](https://www.ageofascent.com/terms-conditions/)). 
  * If we say ‘rules’ or ‘rules of the game’ we’re talking about each Sites’ Rules of The Game (for [Illyriad, click here](http://forum.illyriad.co.uk/rules_forum3.html)   ; for Age of Ascent, these haven’t been written yet as the game is not yet live!) . 
  * Both ‘personal information’ and ‘personal data’ have the same meaning in the context of this policy.


  1. ### The type of personal information we collect

We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Sites. The most common types of information we collect includes things like:

    3. IP addresses (whenever you use the Sites), 
    4. payment agent details (when you buy Prestige), 
    5. transactional details (when you buy Prestige),

      2. when you provide it to us directly, such as when you complete registration, subscribe to a newsletter, submit feedback or send a communication.
    2. We process your personal information collected through other people (ie. we are a ‘ **data processor** ’) when you use third party services associated with the Sites (such as if you make a Prestige purchase through PayPal), and these third parties provide us with your information in order for us to process your transaction.

    2. third party service providers (like Facebook, Google & Steam) who are located in the US or EEA, who may provide information about you when you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party authentication provider and they send us information - such as your registration ID. The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider.

  10. ### Cookies and web analytics

    1. A cookie consists of information sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser. The information is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser.
    2. We use both "session" cookies and "persistent" cookies on the Sites.
    3. We use session cookies to: 
      1. keep track of you whilst you navigate the website, and keep you logged-in (until you log out or are ‘timed out’); and 
      2. ensure you are not in breach of any of the Terms & Conditions and Rules Of The Game.
    4. We use persistent cookies to: 
      1. enable our website to recognise you when you visit; and

    5. Session cookies will be deleted from your computer when you close your browser.
    6. Persistent cookies will remain stored on your computer until deleted, or until they reach a specified expiry date.
    7. Most browsers allow you to reject all cookies, whilst some browsers allow you to reject just third party cookies.  Please seek information from your browser’s ‘Help’ page to find out how to block cookies, if you wish to do so. Blocking all cookies will, however, have a negative impact upon the usability of many websites, including this one. 
    8. When you visit our Sites, there’s certain information that’s recorded which is generally anonymous information and does not necessarily reveal your identity. If you’re logged into your account some of this information could be associated with your account. We’re talking about the following kinds of details: 
      1. your IP address or proxy server IP address;
      2. the domain name you requested;
      3. the name of your internet service provider is sometimes captured depending on the configuration of your ISP connection;

      5. the length of your session;
      6. the pages which you have accessed;
      7. the browser and version you used;
      8. the file URLs you look at and information relating to it;
      9. the website which referred you to our Sites; and
      10. the operating system which your computer uses.
  11. ### Information about children

Our Sites are not suitable for children under the age of 16 years, so if you are under 16 we ask that you do not use our Sites or give us your personal information. 

  12. ### Information you make public or give to others

If you make your personal information available to other people, we can’t control or accept responsibility for the way they will use or manage that data.

There are lots of ways that you can find yourself providing information to other people, like when you post a public message on a forum thread, share information via social media, or make contact with another user whether via an in-game-mail or via a chat facility that we provide.

**Think carefully** before making your personal information publicly available or giving your information to anyone else.

  13. ### How long we keep your personal information

    1. We retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you and others, and to comply with our legal obligations. 
    2. If you no longer want us to use your personal information or to provide you with the game services, you can close your game account. 
    3. Please note that we will retain information from deleted accounts as necessary: 
      1. for our legitimate business interests, 
      2. to comply with the law, 
      3. prevent fraud,
