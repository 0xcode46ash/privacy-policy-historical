1\. Information Collection and Use  
We do not collect Personal Information about you, except when you provide it to us. When you submit your Personal Information on this Website, you will be asked to consent to the processing and transfers of your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If you would prefer that we do not collect any Personal Information from you, please do not provide us with any such information – however, note that we must take some Personal Information about you in order to process the purchase of any products which you may wish to buy via the Website. Without such Personal Information, we will not be able to process such orders.

Except as otherwise disclosed in this Privacy Policy, we will use the Personal Information you provide us through this Website only for the purposes of processing your orders and responding to any comments or questions you have. 

We may use the information you provide in aggregate (non-personally identifiable) form for internal business purposes, such as generating statistics and developing marketing plans. We may collect, store or accumulate certain non-personally identifiable information concerning your use of this Website, such as information regarding which of our pages are most popular and general website administration. 

We may share or transfer Personal Information and non-personally identifiable information with or to our affiliates, our partners and our licensors, as well as our fulfillment houses, to:  
\- enhance this Website and/or the products and/or services made available by means of it;  
\- enable them to process orders and/or any returns from you ; and  
\- enable them to undertake marketing activities on our behalf to which you may have consented when you provide your Personal Information to us.

Such affiliates, licensees and partners, as well as some of our fulfillment houses, may be located in countries both inside and outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Although countries outside the EEA may not require the same level of protection of Personal Information as countries within the EEA, we always demand that our affiliates, licensees and partners adhere to the same procedures that we follow ourselves with respect to your Personal Information, including this Privacy Policy. 

We will not sell or rent or otherwise make available your Personal Information to third parties without your consent, except as disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 

We may also use your information to tell you about our products, promotions and special offers that may be of interest to you, by mail or by telephone. All customers are given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such further information at the time that they give us their Personal Information. All customers may also opt-in to receiving such further information by email, SMS and other forms of electronic communication at the time that they give us their Personal Information. However, these decisions may be reversed at any time by emailing info@illuminas-global.com.

We may disclose any information, including Personal Information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request.

5\. Third Parties  
We may retain other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf in relation to the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy. Examples include credit/debit card validation and authorisation agencies, data analysis firms, customer support specialists, webhosting companies, and fulfillment houses (e.g., companies that coordinate mailings or distribute products on our behalf). Such third parties may be provided with access to your Personal Information if needed to perform their functions, but may not use such information for any other purpose. 

Such third parties may be located in countries both inside and outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). Although countries outside the EEA may not require the same level of protection of Personal Information as countries within the EEA, we always demand that third parties adhere to the same procedures that we follow ourselves with respect to your Personal Information, including this Privacy Policy.

7\. Security  
We implement various security measures to protect the security of your Personal Information, both on-line and off-line. We use a password protected login system to store your details. Only the last four digits of any credit cards used for order payments are stored. We do store card security codes and issue/expiry information to use in dealing with our financial fulfilment house should any payment issues arise (such as refunds). Your Personal Information will be stored at facilities located across the world and not necessarily within the EEA. 

8\. Business Transfers  
As we continue to develop our business, we might sell certain of our assets or be sold.
