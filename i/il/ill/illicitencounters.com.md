Doing this has put some laughter and a spark back in me. Which does help make home more bearable.

## Privacy Policy

[](https://web.archive.org/faq/3/)

Protecting your privacy is very important to our website. We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent.

This privacy policy describes how we collect and use your data. If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy policy or its enforcement, please feel free to contact us via our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/?page=contact_us).

Illicit Encounters® collects information our users submit to us such as their name and e-mail address to allow us to identify users and notify them of changes or updates to our service. We also collect personal information submitted by our users in filling out their profile on the service such as gender, location, age, etc. We collect this personal information when our users: sign up as a member; make changes to their member profile information; and send e-mail messages. Members may choose to provide additional information beyond their basic profile for their other profile sections. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but enables our users to better connect and interact with each other. 

Like many other Web sites, Illicit Encounters® uses a standard technology called "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive - not on our site. They can help make the Internet experience quicker and more convenient. Members who disable cookies will not be able to use all the features of Illicit Encounters®. 

We will not sell, lease or exchange your personal data to third parties without first obtaining your express consent, unless required by law or to protect your membership. 

The Illicit Encounters® site may contain links to other Web sites. Please be aware that Illicit Encounters® is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites our users choose to visit. If our users provide any information directly to parties other than Illicit Encounters®, different rules may apply to the use or disclosure of the personal information disclosed. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing your personal information to third parties. 

Please be aware that whenever members voluntarily disclose personal information online - e.g. user profiles, shout messages etc - that information becomes public and can be collected and used by others. By posting personal information online in public forums, members may receive unsolicited messages from other parties.
