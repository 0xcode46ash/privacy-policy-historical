# Privacy Policy - Illuminate Education

## **Illuminate Education, Inc.**

Revised January 5, 2016

### **I. Your Privacy Rights Are Important To Us**

The privacy of students, their parents and guardians, and visitors of this website is important to Illuminate Education, Inc. (“Illuminate”). This Privacy Policy is intended to answer your questions about the privacy practices applicable to our Website, [www.illuminateED.com](https://www.illuminateed/.com), as well as the data Illuminate maintains on behalf of teachers, administrators, school districts, counties, and other educational institutions (“Educational Organizations”) throughout the country.

Illuminate partners with Educational Organizations to provide tools to collect, organize, and analyze data about the students and education professionals in their school, CMO, county and/or district. Educational Organizations collect information about students and their guardians, teachers, and other individuals which is then stored and processed by Illuminate. In these situations, the Educational Organization rather than Illuminate decides the reasons information will be collected and processed. For details regarding what information Educational Organizations collect and how it will be used, as well as details regarding how to access, correct, or delete such information, please contact your Educational Organization directly. This Privacy Policy does not cover the practices of companies that Illuminate does not own or control, or individuals who Illuminate does not manage.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please [Contact Us](mailto:help@illuminateED.com).

### **  II. Information We Collect Directly from You**

#### **Information Collected from Our Website**

Although you can visit our Website without telling us who you are, when you access our Website, our servers automatically gather information from your browser, such as your IP Address. Your IP address is a unique number assigned to your computer or device by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). Collecting IP addresses is a standard practice and is generally done automatically. Our servers may also track additional information, including but not limited to the pages of our Website that you visit or the services you use, the browser you are using, the operating system of your computer or mobile device, and the way you interact with our services.

Illuminate may, from time to time, use a third-party service, such as Google Analytics, to collect and analyze this type of visitor data. We use this information for a number of purposes, including calculating usage levels, diagnosing server issues, improving our Website and services to better accommodate user patterns, and detecting and diminishing security threats.

#### **Cookies and Web Beacons**

We also use other automated collection tools, such as “cookies” and “web beacons”, to gather information from you and your computer while you are visiting our Website. A cookie is a small file stored on your computer that lets us know whether you’ve visited our Website or accessed our services before and your navigation experience during your visit. Our cookies do not contain or capture personal information. We use cookies to facilitate your access to our services, to enhance your experience, to increase security, and to recognize your computer or device. Cookies allow us to collect statistical information about the usage of our services and Website to improve functionality and design. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust your browser’s settings to decline cookies or otherwise modify your browser’s interactions with cookies. If you choose to disable cookies, it is possible that some of our services’ features may not function properly.

#### **Email Marketing**

Email marketing sent by Illuminate may contain web beacons and other similar technologies to track the response rate to such communications. Web beacons (also known as pixel gifs, pixel tags, clear gifs, third-party pixels, or targeting pixels) are small graphics with a unique piece of identifying code, similar to a cookie, used to track the online movements of a web user or to access previously set cookies. These tools are used in email communications to determine whether messages have been opened or otherwise acted upon.

#### **Do Not Track**

Our services and Website do not respond to your browser’s “do-not-track” signals or comparable mechanisms.

#### **Correspondence Received by Illuminate**

Individuals may correspond directly with Illuminate through our “Contact Us” link or through other supplied contact information. Any personal information submitted through such channels will be used only to respond to such communications.

#### **Children under the Age of Thirteen**

Illuminate does not knowingly collect information about children under the age of thirteen.

### **III. Information We Store On Behalf Of Educational Organizations**

#### **Student and Teacher Information**

Your Educational Organization uses Illuminate’s services to assist with the administration of school-related activities and to provide a streamlined way to organize, access, and report your information. The data your Educational Organization stores on Illuminate’s systems may include the following information about students and their guardians:

  * Demographic information including name, mailing address, email address, and date of birth;
  * Student education records including your student’s grades, class enrollment, and behavioral records;
  * Health-related information including your student’s immunizations and vision and hearing screening results;
  * System usernames and passwords.



In addition to student/guardian information, Illuminate also stores data provided by Educational Organizations related to teachers and other school employees, such as:

  * Demographic information including the individual’s name, address, email address, and date of birth;
  * The individual’s ethnicity;
  * Credentials obtained and the granting institution;
  * Information about the individual’s employment with the Educational Organization;
  * System usernames and passwords.



#### **Disclosure to Third Parties**

Except for the ways outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose the information described in this section to any third party unless we believe that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process served on us or assist government enforcement agencies; (b) investigate or prevent suspected illegal activities or protect the security and integrity of Illuminate Education, Inc.; (c) enforce this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service, or other such binding agreements; (d) take precautions against liability, investigate or defend against any third-party claims or allegations; or (e) exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Illuminate Education, Inc., its employees, customers, or others.

Illuminate only shares information in the ways described in this Privacy Policy. We never sell student records or other user information to third parties. Illuminate stores such information in locations outside its facilities, such as on servers co-located with third-party hosting providers.

As we grow, we may buy or sell assets or business divisions. Generally, the information stored on our systems would be transferred in such a transaction. We may also transfer or assign such information in the course of business combinations, including but not limited to mergers, divestitures, or dissolution. In the event of such a transaction, any successor entity that acquires your information will continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

#### **Review or Deletion of Records Maintained by Illuminate**

To review or update your information to ensure its accuracy or to correct any errors and omissions, please contact your Educational Organization directly. Requests sent to Illuminate seeking a copy of such records, or demanding that Illuminate modify or delete any records that it maintains will be forwarded directly to the appropriate Educational Organization. Please note that even when records are modified or deleted from Illuminate’s active databases, copies may remain in data backups as necessary to comply with business or regulatory requirements.

### **IV. How We Protect Your Information**

Whether collected directly from our Website or maintained on behalf of your Educational Organization, protecting the privacy of your information is important to us. We take security measures—physical, electronic, and procedural—to help defend against the unauthorized access and disclosure of your information. In addition to the restrictions discussed in this Privacy Policy, our employees are required to comply with information security safeguards, and our systems are protected by technological measures to help prevent unauthorized individuals from gaining access. Furthermore, all Illuminate employees are trained to observe and comply with applicable federal and state privacy laws.

Despite these precautions, no system can be completely secure and there remains a risk that unauthorized access or use, hardware or software failure, human error, or a number of other factors may compromise the security of your information.

### **V. Updates to this Privacy Policy**

We may update or modify this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the way Illuminate maintains, uses, shares, or secures your information. Please check this Policy each time you interact with our systems to ensure that you are aware of any revisions. Prior to any material changes to this Policy becoming effective, Illuminate will provide notice to your Educational Organization and allow it the opportunity to make choices regarding the data it stores with Illuminate.
