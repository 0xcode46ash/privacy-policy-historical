legal: privacy policy **information collected**  
Illumina's web server collects information from you during the course of your visit to the Site. This information includes the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your Internet Service Provider, the content you access, the platform operating system and web browser you use, and the date and time of your visit. Illumina collects this information through the use of "cookies," which our web server seeks to place onto the user's hard drive. The iCom portion of this Site also uses cookies to store user-provided information during the order entry session. Illumina does not use cookies to obtain any personally identifiable information, and the information that is collected is used only for internal purposes. You can usually set your browser to reject cookies or to alert you before one is placed if you prefer.

We may also collect information from you through your voluntary submission (e.g. Illumina webinar registration, Illumina Community, iCom account). For instance, you may be required to register with Illumina via this Site in order to access and use certain portions of this Site. To register you will be asked to provide basic contact information (e.g. name, institution/company, address, phone number, email).

**use of collected information**  
Illumina may use the information it collects to improve this Site, to store your interests and preferences in order to customize your visit to this Site, to communicate with you upon your request, to compile and analyze trends, and to carry out the transactions you request when you visit the Site.

Illumina occasionally hires other companies to provide services for us, which services may require that they have access to some of the information collected. Such companies are required to use the information only to perform the services Illumina hired them to provide, and to maintain the confidentiality of the information. Illumina does not provide, sell, or lease information about you to any third parties for their marketing use. Illumina will release information about you if you direct us to do so, if we are required by law to do so, or if necessary to protect and defend the rights or property of Illumina.

**security of collected information**  
Illumina is committed to protecting the security of your personal information and we take reasonable physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards to help protect your personal information from unauthorized or inappropriate access. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. We also restrict access to information about you to those individuals at Illumina who need to know the information in accordance with their job responsibilities, and such access is only made from secured locations. It is your responsibility to protect the confidentiality of your passwords, account information, and any other access features associated with your use of this Site.
