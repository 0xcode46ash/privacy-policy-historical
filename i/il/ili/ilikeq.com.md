# Who do you like? | Ilikeq.com

## Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Ilikeq.

This Privacy Policy describes what information we gather from you, how we use and disclose that information, and what we do to protect it. By using Ilikeq, you expressly consent to the information handling practices described in this policy.

The Information Ilikeq Collects:  
User-Provided Information: You may provide to Ilikeq what is generally called "personally identifiable" information (such as your email address, age, zip code) when using Ilikeq, such as when you register, and when you use the Apps or purchase virtual goods. If you use Ilikeq with your mobile device, or sign up to receive alerts via text message, we may also have access to your device ID or phone number.

"Cookies" Information: When you use Ilikeq, we may send one or more cookies - small text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer. Ilikeq may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to Ilikeq. Persistent cookies can be removed. Please review your web browser "Help" file to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. Please note that if you delete, or choose not to accept, cookies from Ilikeq, you may not be able to utilize the features of Ilikeq to their fullest potential.

"Automatically Collected" Information: When you use Ilikeq or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the web pages or sites that you visit just before or just after Ilikeq, the pages you view on Ilikeq, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use Ilikeq.

Information from Other Sources: We may also obtain information, including personally identifiable information, from third parties and sources other than Ilikeq, such as other users who send messages to you through Ilikeq, or third party service providers who you use to access features of Ilikeq, such as purchasing in-game virtual goods. By using Apps offered by Ilikeq on Facebook, Ilikeq will have access to your Facebook profile information that your Facebook privacy settings are configured to expose to Facebook apps, and user activity within some Facebook applications. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personally identifiable information that we collect through Ilikeq, we will treat the combined information as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The Way Ilikeq Uses Information:  
Ilikeq uses the information you provide or that we collect to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and services found on Ilikeq. We will use your email address to contact you for administrative purposes, for customer service purposes, to address intellectual property infringement, rights of privacy, or defamation issues, or any regarding content that you have posted to Ilikeq.

Ilikeq uses all of the information that you provide or that we collect and/or aggregate to understand and analyze the usage trends, interests, and preferences of our users, to improve the way Ilikeq works and looks, and to create new features and functionality.

Various aspects of Ilikeq, such as content on the Ilikeq Site and in the Apps, and email messages we send you in connection with your use of Ilikeq, may include relevant advertisements which may be selected based in part on your demographic information, interests, preferences, and usage patterns within Ilikeq.

Ilikeq may use "automatically collected" information and "cookies" information to: (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit Ilikeq; (b) provide customized third party advertisements, content, and information; (c) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of Ilikeq and third party marketing activities; (d) monitor aggregate usage metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, Apps accessed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in any promotions or other activities.

Ilikeq may use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send promotional email related to Ilikeq we think you may be interested in. You will have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages, or by updating your profile.

When Ilikeq Discloses Information:  
Your privacy is very important to us, and we are not in the business of selling your information.

Ilikeq makes certain automatically collected and other aggregate non-personally-identifiable information available to interested third parties, including premium subscribers, to assist such parties in understanding our users’ interests, habits, and usage patterns for certain programs, content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality available through Ilikeq.

Ilikeq works with third party service providers to provide website and application development, hosting, and maintenance as well as other services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these service providers to complete their contractual obligations to Ilikeq, these third parties may have access to or process your personally identifiable information. Generally, these disclosures are made under terms comparable to this policy, and the recipients are limited to using the information the purpose for which it was provided.

Ilikeq may also disclose your information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright law), in response to a court order, judicial or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement activity.

Ilikeq also reserves the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take precautions against liability; to protect Ilikeq and others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity; to investigate and defend ourselves against any third party claims or allegations; to assist government enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of Ilikeq; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Ilikeq, our users, or others.

Your Choices:  
You may, of course, decline to share certain personally identifiable information with Ilikeq, in which case Ilikeq may not be able to provide to you some of the features and functionality found on Ilikeq. You may update, correct, or delete your profile information and preferences at any time by accessing your account preferences page through Ilikeq. Please note that while your changes may be reflected promptly in active user databases, we may retain all information you submit for a variety of purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and abuse, and analytics.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you account access or making corrections to your information. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information at all times.

Third Party Services:  
Ilikeq contains links to Web sites and services provided by third parties. Any personally identifiable information you provide on third party sites or services is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s policies governing privacy and security. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of third party sites or services to which links are displayed on Ilikeq. We encourage you to learn about third parties’ privacy and security policies before providing them with personally identifiable information.

Our Commitment to Children’s Privacy:  
Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Ilikeq does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age, and no part of Ilikeq is directed to persons under 13. If you are under 13 years of age, then please do not use or access Ilikeq at any time or in any manner. If Ilikeq learns that personally identifiable information of children under the age of 13 has been collected on Ilikeq without verifiable parental consent, then Ilikeq will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.

Our Commitment to Data Security:  
Ilikeq uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Ilikeq, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Ilikeq makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.

If Ilikeq learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective steps. Ilikeq may post a notice through Ilikeq if a security breach occurs.

In the Event of Merger or Sale:  
In the event that all or a portion of Ilikeq or its assets is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information that we have collected from users in connection with such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy: Please revisit this page periodically to stay aware of any changes to this Privacy Policy, which may be revised periodically at Ilikeq’ sole discretion, as provided in Section 9.a) of the Ilikeq Terms of Use. If we modify the Privacy Policy, we will make it available through Ilikeq, and indicate the date of the latest revision. In the event that the modifications materially alter your rights or obligations hereunder we will make reasonable efforts to notify you of the change. For example, we may send a message to your email address, if we have one on file, or generate a pop-up or similar notification when you access Ilikeq for the first time after such material changes are made. Our amended Privacy Policy will automatically take effect 30 days after it is made available through Ilikeq, except that (i) we generally only use your personal information in the manner described in the Privacy Policy in effect when we received that personal information and (ii) if you do not agree with any changes to the Privacy Policy, you may terminate your account ceasing use of Ilikeq. Your continued use of Ilikeq after revised Privacy Policy has become effective indicates that you have read, understood and agreed to the current version of the Privacy Policy.
