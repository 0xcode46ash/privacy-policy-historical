**Intersections, Inc. Privacy Policy**

**Intersections is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers. For this reason, Intersections does not use cookies. We will not disclose any information about you to any outside third party unless it is for the express purpose of delivering our products and services to you or unless it is required by law. Therefore, we will not disclose, sell, resell or share your credit information, nor any data derived in our interaction with you, to other organizations and/or individuals for any purpose, including advertising.**

Intersections is fully committed to protecting your personal information, and in so doing we provide the above guarantee. By using our Web site, you consent to the collection and use of information as it is disclosed in this Privacy and Security Policy Statement.

We recognize and share the privacy and security concerns of visitors to our Web site. The following Online Privacy and Security Policy provides our Web site visitors with key information as it relates to this important topic: the type of information we collect and its security, how we use the collected information, the benefits to you from the information we do collect, and its disclosure.

**What information does Intersections collect?**

Intersections asks for information necessary to provide our products and services to you. To ensure that we protect your personal credit data, we ask questions to authenticate who you are. During the credit order process, we need the following information in order to process your membership and fulfill your benefits: your name, social security number, e-mail address, mailing address, date of birth, credit card type, credit card number and credit card expiration date.

To ensure the authenticity of the individuals who order our credit information products, we always require a social security number in addition to the customer information mentioned above. This is necessary for us to be absolutely certain that we identify you correctly when credit information is pulled from the credit reporting agencies.

Members assign their own user name and password to our restricted, members-only section. In addition, we may contact you by e-mail to confirm enrollment or check the accuracy of supplied information as well as to send you notices about special offers, new products, services, promotions and other similar information. Should you wish not to receive e-mails from us, please advise us by e-mail. We will respect your wishes regarding the methods we use to communicate with you.

In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we also gather information such as general usage of our Web site, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior and other similar information that is not specific to any one person. We use this compiled information solely for the improvement of our Web site, our product and service offerings, our operations and our customer service. We do not share this information with any other organization.

**How secure is this information?**

Intersections Inc. uses the most advanced technology available. 128-bit encrypted Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) keeps your personal information, including credit card numbers, secure from unauthorized access. SSL is supported by Netscape 4.0+, Microsoft IE 4.0+, and most frame-enabled browsers.

To further ensure that our efforts in implementing our security policy are valid, we engaged ICSA.net, a nationally recognized security firm, to conduct a security audit known as a TruSecure assessment, which concluded that Intersections Inc. met or exceeded all requirements for ICSA.net certification. The following is a quote from their certification letter: “Intersections Inc. has a superior overall security posture. Intersections Inc. abides strictly by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, and is in compliance with the processing, privacy and security requirements of the national credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion).”

**Does Intersections Inc. disclose the information it collects to outside parties?**

No, we do not disclose and/or sell any confidential customer information that is obtained or derived from our online interaction with you. However, we must cooperate fully should a situation arise whereby we are REQUIRED by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

**How does Intersections Inc. update its Privacy and Security Policy?**

Any changes to our Privacy and Security Policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect and how we use it, as well as the latest updates on how we maintain the secure portions of our Web sites.
