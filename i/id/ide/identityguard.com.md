**INTERSECTIONS INC. CUSTOMER PRIVACY POLICY**

At Intersections, protecting your identity and personal information is our mission. We provide this policy statement because we want you to be fully informed about how we protect the privacy of your information.

As part of our products and services, we may, based on the authorization you have provided, retrieve your credit report information from consumer reporting agencies on your behalf and provide that information to you. We also may, based on your instructions, retrieve and report to you additional personal information about you from various sources, such as Web sites and other available data sources. We do not disclose that credit report information or other personal information to anyone but you, except for our service providers who help us provide our products and services to you. We also may disclose that information:

  * in accordance with your express instructions or consent, or the express instructions or consent of your authorized representative;
  * to carry out transactions requested by you;
  * for fraud prevention;
  * to comply with federal or state legal requirements, or as otherwise provided by law.



In addition to your credit report information as described above, we collect other personal information in order to:

  * process your application for our products and services.
  * verify your identity and retrieve your credit report information.
  * provide our products and services to you, including customer service and payment processing.



For those purposes, we may collect such information as your name, Social Security number, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, date of birth, credit card or other payment information, and service records. We may disclose that information to our service providers. We also may disclose that information:

  * in accordance with your express instructions or consent, or the express instructions or consent of your authorized representative;
  * to carry out transactions requested by you;
  * for fraud prevention;
  * to comply with federal or state legal requirements; or
  * as otherwise provided by law.



If you became a customer for our products and services through a financial institution with whom we have a joint marketing agreement, we may disclose your information – but not your credit report information – to that financial institution for use in connection with our jointly offered products and services.

We also may use that information to contact you about our products and services and those of our financial institution partners. By responding to offers by our financial institution partners, you may be disclosing your nonpublic personal information directly to them.

You may notice that we do not offer an “opt-out” of disclosure to third parties for marketing purposes. We do not offer an opt-out because we only disclose your information as described above. Companies who offer an “opt-out” may sell, rent or lease your information to direct marketers, or otherwise provide your information to third parties for marketing purposes, unless you follow the opt-out procedure. 

If you access our Web site, we may use “ session cookies”.  Session cookies are small bits of computer code that we install on your computer for use only during a one-time “session” at our Web site. We use session cookies to make your visit to our Web site easier, and to collect information such as traffic, viewing and usage patterns, but only on an anonymous basis.

We do not use “persistent cookies,” which recognize your computer when you return to our Web site. Because we do not use persistent cookies, you will have to enter your personal information each time you return to a members-only area on our Web site.

To access your personal information on our Web site, you are required to select a user name and password. It is your responsibility to restrict access to your user name and password so that only you may gain entry to your personal information online.

We recognize the importance of advanced security for your information. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. We also undergo both an annual Web certification and quarterly scans or tests by a nationally recognized computer security firm. 

You may access our Web site through other Web sites. We are not responsible for the collection of information by those other Web sites, and are not bound by any policies or statements made on such sites. Other Web sites, Internet search engines and marketing companies through which you access our Web site may use persistent or session cookies and collect information such as traffic, viewing and usage patterns.

Our Web site, and our products and services, are designed for use only by individuals who are 13 years or older.  We do not knowingly solicit or retain information from individuals who are less than 13 years old.

We will not change these policies until those changes are posted on our Web site. If you use our Website, you agree that we may notify you of changes to our privacy policy by updating this Web site.

If you have questions or comments about our privacy policy, please contact us at the customer service number posted on our Web site or provided in your materials.
