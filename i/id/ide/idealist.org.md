While using Idealist’s Offerings can, in certain instances, involve sharing various pieces of information about yourself and communicating with us, or other Organizations, Individual Users, Groups, and the public at large, your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.  This Privacy Policy explains what type of information we may collect from you when you use one of our Offerings, how we may use this information, who might have access to it, which choices you have about how it can be used and shared, and/or what measures Idealist takes to protect such information.

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect:

  * When you interact with our other Users and their websites, mobile applications, pages or via email or print;
  * When you interact with our advertising and pages on third-party websites and through third-party services; and

Please read this Privacy Policy, and the rest of our Agreement, carefully to understand our requirements, procedures and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it.  If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or any another part of our Agreement, or if you do not consent to having your personal information processed or collected, your choice is to opt out of part or all of our Offerings.  By using our Offerings you understand and acknowledge that our governing principles are outlined in our Agreement, and you should refrain from using our Offerings if you disagree with them.  This Privacy Policy, as well as other parts of the Agreement, may change from time to time.  Your continued use of an Idealist Offering after we make changes to our Agreement and its policies is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check our Agreement periodically for updates.

### 3\. YOUR CONTROL OVER YOUR INFORMATION

You can review and change your personal information by logging into the Site and visiting your account profile page.

If you are an Individual User, Idealist may share your information either with your consent, or as otherwise provided in this Agreement.  If you have an Organization account in the capacity of a non-profits for the purposes of hiring employees with Idealist, all information you share, including your organization profile, and all Listings you post, in addition to any of your Contributions, may be viewable through or shared within our Offerings.

Here are some additional things to remember:

  * Information you make available to others might be re-shared or copied by those individuals and organizations.
  * We may provide you with real-time chat features and enable your ability to connect with other users in our Mobile App and other Offerings.
  * We may provide you with discussion or comment features for your use.  In the event you voluntarily disclose personal information using an Offering, that information, along with any content in your Contribution, communication or post, can be collected, correlated, and used by others.  This may result in unsolicited messages from or improper and unauthorized use of your personal information by third parties.  Such activities are beyond our control, and by using our Offering you acknowledge that such publically posted Contributions may be copied or stored by other Users or third-parties.

### 4\. THIRD PARTY LINKS

We may provide links within an Offering to other sites of interest.  We do not endorse the content of these sites or guarantee that they will abide by this Privacy Policy or the other standards outlined in our Agreement.  Your use of such linked sites is subject to the terms of use and privacy policies of the providers of those sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave an Offering of ours to read the terms of use and privacy policies of each site that collects your personal information.

### 5\. DATA SECURITY & HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION

We have implemented measures designed to secure your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, and disclosure.  All information you provide to us is stored on secure servers behind firewalls.  Any payment transactions will be encrypted.  In the case that it is stored by third parties we use, your account information may be stored on a secured server behind a firewall.  When you enter sensitive information (like your password), the information is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

The safety and security of your information also depends on you.  Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Sites or Mobile Apps, you are responsible for keeping such password(s) confidential.  We ask you not to share your password(s) with anyone, and refresh such password(s) as is deemed prudent.  You can reduce the inherent risks associated with using the Internet by exercising common sense and discretion: for example, you should choose a strong password, use different passwords for different websites and services, and use updated antivirus software.

We do our best to keep your information secure, but you must actively participate in the process of keeping your information safe.  We reserve the right to analyze accounts for fraudulent or irregular behavior and we may limit use of site features in response to possible signs of abuse.  We urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of our Offerings, like message boards.  The information you share in public areas may be viewed by any user of our Site(s) and Mobile Apps.  Please timely report any security violations to us as outlined in the section below.

### 6\. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY

We may change this Privacy Policy or other parts of our Agreement from time to time.  If we do make a change to this Agreement, we will announce and post such revisions on our Sites and Mobile Apps.  We encourage you to review our Agreement periodically.  If you continue to use our Offerings after the announcement of any policy revisions, you will be deemed to have agreed to the changed terms and practices.  Questions, comments, or complaints about our Privacy Policy or the rest of our Agreement should be submitted to us by one of the methods listed above.

### 7\. QUESTIONS AND CONCERNS
