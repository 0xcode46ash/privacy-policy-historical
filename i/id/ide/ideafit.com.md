IDEA understands how important privacy is to our members. We are committed to protecting your privacy and want to make sure that you understand how your membership information is used. We also want you to be aware that you have choices about how we use this information. 

What Information We Collect: When you apply for membership, we ask for basic information such as your name, address, e-mail, etc. We keep track of your participation in IDEA events and member services (like liability insurance, etc.) so we can understand our members' interests and evaluate the effectiveness of our offerings. We also collect demographic information from other sources to help us learn more about member characteristics and needs. In addition, we may ask for additional information in your visits to www.ideafit.com. All of this information helps us better serve our members and improve our programs. 

As a way of providing additional membership value, we ask for your e-mail address so that you may receive the IDEA e-Newsletter and membership e-mail communications on a regular basis. This helps the association control our mailing expenses and communicate with members. IDEA does not release or provide for sale ANY member e-mail information. We do not support e-mail SPAM in any form and provide an easy subscriber "opt-out" on every email communication sent by the association. 

Information Sharing: We share your mailing list information (name & address) only with companies that we believe are reputable and have beneficial products or services that are of value to IDEA members. Some of the providers of IDEA member services, including some of those listed on our Member Services and Discounts area, pay a fee for access to our mailing list. Our contracts with these companies require them to keep the mailing list information strictly confidential; we oversee the companies' compliance by only making our lists available to bonded, third-party mailing firms who conduct the mailing on behalf of these companies. No company actually has direct access to our membership mailing list. Finally, we may release personal member information on the rare occasions when we are required to do so by law, or when necessary or appropriate to comply with legal process or to protect or defend IDEA and its members. We do not sell or rent mailing list to telemarketers or mailing list brokers. 

We respect your choices. If you do not want us to share your name and address information with providers of IDEA member services, you can contact us as specified below.
