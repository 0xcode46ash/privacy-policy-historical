# Idera: Tools for Data Management - Privacy Policy

At Idera we are committed to respecting and protecting the privacy of our customers, partners and web site visitors. Specifically, we do not sell, rent or trade email lists with other companies for marketing purposes. In this Privacy Policy we provide information on when and why we collect your personal information, how we use it, the limited conditions under which we may disclose it to others and how we keep it secure.

Collection and Use of Personal Information  
---  
Personal information means any information that may be used to identify you, such as, your name, title, phone number, email address, or mailing address.

In general, you can browse our web site without giving us any personal information. We use web analytics software to analyze traffic to this web site in order to understand our customer's and visitor's needs and to continually improve our site for them. This software collects only anonymous, aggregate statistics. For example, we do not tie a specific visit to a specific IP address.

If you want to subscribe to a periodic communication such as a newsletter, we ask you to simply provide your business email address. In that case, we use your email address only in connection with providing you the newsletter and for no other purpose.

Additional activities on our site may require you to be registered, for example, to read a white paper, download trial or free software, or register for an event. As part of the registration process, we may ask you for additional personal information. We use that information for several general purposes: to tell you about products and services if you so request, to fulfill your request, to contact you if we need to obtain or provide additional information; to verify the accuracy of our records, to contact you regarding customer satisfaction surveys.

Some activities require additional personal information. For example, to fulfill online orders for products, we require you to enter credit card information, and you have the option to provide a separate shipping address.

Disclosure of Personal Information  
---  
In some instances we rely on our channel partners to fulfill product trials and information requests, and provide customers and prospective customers with information about Idera and its products. To do this, we may pass your information to them for that purpose only, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Idera sometimes hires vendor companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including packaging, mailing and delivering items, sending postal mail, providing technical support, and processing event registrations. We provide those companies only the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Because Idera is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Idera offices or subsidiaries in the U.S., Europe, and elsewhere. The data protection laws in these countries may be more or less extensive than laws in the country in which you are located. However, Idera and its offices and subsidiaries are governed by this Privacy Policy and will use your personal information only as set forth in this policy.

By using our web site and providing us with your personal data, you consent to this transfer of your personal data.

Idera may also disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Idera and/or its subsidiaries or to (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on Idera or this web site; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of Idera and this web site; (3) enforce its agreements with you, or (4) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety or the public.

Children and Privacy  
---  
Our web site does not offer information intended to attract children. Idera does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13.

Security of Personal Information  
---  
When you submit any form requiring registration, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) helps protect your information as it travels over the Internet by encrypting that information before it is sent to us. We have also implemented industry-standard security mechanisms and procedures to protect data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.

Use of Cookies  
---  
Portions of this website may use cookies to keep track of your visit, or to deliver content specific to your interests. A "Cookie" is a small amount of data transferred to your browser and read by the Web server that placed it there. It works as a sort of identification card, recording your preferences and previously entered information. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to accept or reject it.

Links to Other Web Sites and Public Forums  
---  
Our web site contains links to information on other web sites. We do not have any control over these other web sites, and therefore we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you provide while visiting those sites. Those sites are not governed by this Privacy Policy, and if you have questions about how a site uses your information, consult that site's privacy statement. Portions of this website may also make chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to visitors. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

Access to Your Personal Information  
---  
You are entitled to access the personal information that we hold. Email your request to our Data Privacy Officer at [privacy@idera.com](mailto:privacy@idera.com). An administrative fee may be payable. 

Unsubscribing
