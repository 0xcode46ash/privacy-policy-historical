# Identified

At Identified, we value your privacy and understand your need to keep personal information private. We believe that you should maintain total and absolute control over what others see. In fact, **that's why we built Identified**. We understand the value of a person's Facebook network in finding a job. Given the amount of highly personal information on Facebook, we wanted to create a **safe space** where you could connect with companies.

 **On Identified, you interact with your Facebook network and colleagues in a purely professional setting**. Rest assured that when you join, we pull only your relevant professional information (education and work history) and not personal information (pictures, status updates, etc.). Furthermore, you maintain total control over your communications with companies. Finally, your friend network will never see sensitive information, such as your GPA or companies that you have applied to.

We offer tools to help you upload your friends' contact information so that you can find your friends on Identified, and invite friends who do not use Identified to join. But we never store your password or email your contacts without your explicit consent. Additionally, users can unsubscribe from further email communication through the unsubscribe link included in the footer of all of Identified's email notifications.

Simply put, without your consent, we do not and will not share your private information with anyone, for any reason, at any time. If you have feedback regarding our privacy policies, please send us your thoughts at [feedback@identified.com](mailto:feedback@identified.com).
