**Privacy Statement**  
 

IdentoGO Centers (formerly L-1 Enrollment Services) are operated by MorphoTrust USA, the nation’s leading identity solutions provider. MorphoTrust has long recognized that individuals with whom we conduct business value their privacy. However, in order to conduct business in this increasingly electronic economy, the collection of personal information is often necessary and desirable. It is our goal to balance the benefits of the Internet with the right of individuals to prevent the misuse of their personal information.

**The Collection of Personal Information**  
In some circumstances, MorphoTrust may request personal information from you, like your name, e-mail address, company name, or telephone number. Your response to these inquiries is strictly voluntary. We use this information to customize your experience on our website. In addition, we may use this information for other business purposes, such as alerting you of products and services that can assist you in your business, promoting site registration, and assisting in order processing.

In general, you can visit our site without divulging any personal information. However, there are areas of this site that require this information to complete their customization functions, and may not be available to those choosing not to reveal the information requested.

**Collecting Domain Information**  
MorphoTrust also collects domain information as part of its analysis of the use of this site. This data enables us to become more familiar with which customers visit our site, how often they visit, and what parts of the site they visit most often. We use this information to improve its web-based offerings. This information is collected automatically and requires no action on your part.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**  
In cases where we believe your business interests will be served, MorphoTrust may share your information (with the exception of account, credit card, and ordering information) with our Business Partners, who can alert you about new products and services to improve your competitive edge. If you receive unwanted marketing materials from any of our Business Partners, please let them know that you wish to be removed from their contact list.

**Use of Cookies**  
Some pages on this site use “cookies,” which are small files that the site places on your hard drive for identification purposes. These files are used for site registration and customization the next time you visit us. You should note that cookies cannot read data off of your hard drive. Your web browser may allow you to be notified when you are receiving a cookie, giving you the choice to accept it or not. By not accepting cookies, some pages may not fully function and you may not be able to access certain information on this site.
