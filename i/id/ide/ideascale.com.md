**Registration Information**

  In order to use the Services, you must first complete a registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give your name and email address.

These communications are used to give you a better understanding of the Services and to support your use of the Services. As always, you have the option not to receive these communications (see Section 5 below). Additionally, an IdeaScale customer may upload email addresses to the Services for the purpose of inviting the address owners to customer's IdeaScale community. IdeaScale will never share any email address, regardless of how it was collected, with any third party without the email address owner's explicit consent.

  **Billing Information**

  If you purchase a service from IdeaScale, you must provide your contact information (such as name and billing address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date).

**Community Information**

In private communities, idea submissions, comments, and usernames are only viewable by members of the private community.

**Information Collected on behalf of IdeaScale Customers**

IdeaScale collects information under the direction of its customers and has no direct relationship with the individuals whose personal data it processes on behalf of its customers. If you are an end user of the Services through an IdeaScale customer and would no longer like to be contacted by that customer, or you seek to access, correct, amend, or delete inaccurate personal data, and are unable to do so as instructed in Section 8, please contact that customer directly. If requested to remove data, IdeaScale will respond within a reasonable timeframe. IdeaScale may transfer personal information to companies that help it provide the Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements between IdeaScale and its customers. IdeaScale retains personal data it processes on behalf of its customers for as long as needed to provide the Services to its customers. IdeaScale retains this personal information as necessary to comply with its legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce its agreements.

**3\. COMMUNICATIONS FROM IDEASCALE  **  
   
**Ongoing Communication and Service Updates**  
   
IdeaScale occasionally sends its users information on service updates and enhancements, new offerings, and additional instructions on how best to use of the Services. These communications are designed to educate you about the Services.  IdeaScale provides you the option not to receive these types of communications; please see Section 5 below for details.

**Service-related Announcements**  
   
IdeaScale sends service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if a service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, IdeaScale may inform you about the suspension with an email. Service-related emails are also sent to confirm billing transactions, account upgrades, and account cancellations. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, since they are necessary to provide the Services. If you do not want to receive service-related announcements, you have the option to cancel your account.  
   
**Customer Service**  
   
At the commencement of your use of the Services, IdeaScale will send you an email to verify your username and password. Throughout your use of the Services, IdeaScale account management and/or support may use your contact information to answer your questions, to respond to service requests, and to provide account management services.  
   
**4\. INFORMATION SHARING AND DISCLOSURE  **  
   
IdeaScale shares personally identifiable information with third parties only as follows:

 _To Provide Services from Third-Party Service Providers._

 IdeaScale uses third-party tools to aid its delivery of its Services to you. Such service providers are contractually bound to keep your information confidential and to use your information only as necessary to provide their services. Examples of such providers include administrative tool providers, data centers and chat support hosts.

 _To Process Credit Card Payments._

 IdeaScale uses outside credit card processing companies to process your credit card payments. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.  
 

 _To Provide Requested Partner Services._

 If you specifically request a service from one of our partnering companies, your personally identifiable information will be shared with the applicable partnering company. After such a request is made, the partnering company may contact you directly regarding your inquiry. Any service offered by a partnering company will be clearly indicated as a partner's service and not IdeaScale's, and any request must be initiated solely by the user.  
 

 _To Provide Requested Materials._

 If you voluntarily submit your personally identifiable information when requesting informational materials from IdeaScale, this information will be shared with a third-party marketing automations tool, which IdeaScale uses to automate and target its messages to you.

 _To Comply with Law._

 IdeaScale reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when it believes that disclosure is necessary to protect its rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. This includes required disclosures by IdeaScale of a European Union individual's personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.  
 

 _To Continue Providing Services in the Event of a Merger or Acquisition._

 If IdeaScale is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email or a prominent notice within the Services of any change in ownership or uses of your personally identifiable information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personally identifiable information.  
   
**5\. OPT-OUT**  
   
If you no longer wish to receive communications about service updates, new offerings, or how best to use the Services, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions that are included in each email. As noted in Section 3 above, if you do not want to receive service-related announcements (announcements that are necessary to provide the Services), your only option is to cancel your account.  
   
**6\. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES**  
   
As is true of most web sites, IdeaScale gathers certain information automatically and stores it in log files.  This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. IdeaScale does not link this automatically collected data to other information collected about you.  
   
Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts and similar tracking technologies are used by IdeaScale, IdeaScale affiliates, marketing partners, analytics providers and online customer support providers. These technologies are used to analyze trends, to administer the Services, to track activity in the Services, to gather demographic information about the user base, and to create reports regarding use for internal review.  
   
Third parties, with whom IdeaScale partners to provide certain features on the Services or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, may use local shared objects (LSOs) and HTML 5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5. To manage cookies, see Section 7 below.

Additionally, your publicly available IP address is collected for the purpose determining the appropriate language in which to provide the Services. In non-United States jurisdictions an IP address may be classified as personal information or personal data under applicable laws; therefore, to the extent that IdeaScale collects IP addresses, IdeaScale will collect, use, maintain, secure and/or disclose IP addresses in accordance with applicable Laws.
