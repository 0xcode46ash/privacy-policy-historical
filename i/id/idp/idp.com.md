## Privacy Policy

The company is subject to the [Privacy Act](http://www.privacy.gov.au/act/index.html) and the associated National Privacy Principles.

This policy sets out how the company collects, holds and uses personal information collected from individuals in the conduct of our business.

## Protecting Personal Information

All personal information collected from individuals as a result of our business operations will be protected as an essential part of the relationship we wish to establish with our clients. The company will only disclose this information in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Act and the National Privacy Principles.

## Information that the company holds

In the normal course of business activities, the company will collect personal information, including "sensitive information".

Personal information may include an individual's name, address, date of birth, contact details, occupation, and professional memberships.

Sensitive information includes details of an individual's racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, and health information. The company must obtain the consent of the person to collect and use that information.

## Web site traffic tracking

Idp uses an independent company, Red Sheriff ([www.redsheriff.com](http://www.redsheriff.com/) ) to measure and analyse its internet usage to ensure the site meets its objectives with advertisers and users. Individual privacy is protected but idp global gains insights on how make the site more useful for advertisers as well as our users. Red Sheriff is a leader in the internet industry in interactive measurement technologies and market research. Its tracking collects broadly aggregated statistics on: 

  * The number of page views (or page impressions) that occur on an idp site; 
  * The number of unique visitors; 
  * How long these unique visitors (on average) spend on an idp site; and 
  * Common entry and exit points to idp sites. 



The grouped Red Sheriff statistics are made available to educational and other potential advertisers for the purpose of conducting comparisons with other competitive sites. 

Pages on idp sites may be coded with the Red Measure software. This uses either Javascript or a Java Applet*, on the source of the web page. This software stores a "cookie" in the browser, that contains a unique identifier. This enables Red Sheriff to track the number of unique visitors to idp sites. This information is collected and aggregated by Red Sheriff, and in no way does this unique identifier identify a user personally. idp does not and will not marry any data collected by Red Sheriff with any personal information collected by idp. 

If necessary, users can view the content on the web site and disable aspects of its tracking. Red Sheriff’s software code cannot be disabled entirely as the code takes into account all web-browser configurations, including the disabling of Java and Javascript. But, if cookies are disabled in your browser, then Red Sheriff cannot track you as a unique visitor, and will consider you as a new visitor each time you browse a new page on the Network. 

### Disabling Cookies in Netscape and Internet Explorer (IE)

If you use Netscape browser, go to the Edit -> Preferences -> Advanced menu. Change your cookie configuration.

Disabling Microsoft’s Internet Explorer depends on which version you use. To check for your version, click Help -> About Internet Explorer 

In the latest version IE 6.0, go to the Tools -> Internet Options -> Privacy menu. You then select how the browser accepts cookies, based on the source of the cookie, and whether the source has a "privacy policy." There are also features for the advanced user for greater control over cookies. 

In IE 5.0, go Tools -> Internet Options -> Security. Choose the security level for four different browsing conditions: Internet Sites, Local Sites, "Trusted" Sites, and Restricted Sites. If you select "Internet," and click on Custom Level, a dialog box enables you to either accept all, warn before accepting, or reject all cookies. 

With IE 4.0, go View -> Internet Options ->Advanced menu. Again, as with IE5, you can accept all, warn before accepting, or reject all.

*The use of Javascript and/or Java Applet depends on which browser you use. Typically Internet Explorer users with Version 4 or above will use the Javascript method. Netscape users, or users whose browser does not support Javascript 1.1, will use a Java Applet method.

## Use and Disclosure of Personal Information 

The company will use personal information to:

  * provide its services, particularly those associated with student services (eg recruitment, English language testing) 
  * provide students, institutions and other clients of developments in the services it offers 
  * manage its internal business operations 



The company will only disclose information for the purpose for which it was collected, and where appropriate, after obtaining the necessary consent from the individual. Information may be disclosed for other purposes, with the specific consent of the individual to do so.

The company may also be required to disclose personal information where the law requires such disclosure.

## Security of Personal Information

The company will take reasonable steps to ensure the security of personal information that it holds, regardless of the form in which that information is held. This will include taking reasonable steps to prevent the misuse or loss of this information, or unauthorised disclosure, access to, or modification of this information.

Where the information is held in electronic form, access will be controlled by user logins and passwords, and restriction of access only to persons who need to have that access in the course of the company's business activities.

All staff of the company are subject to confidentiality obligations as part of their conditions of employment. 

## Right of Access by the Individual

Any individual can request the company to modify or correct personal information that the person believes to be incorrect. 

The company can refuse to provide access to personal information where the Privacy Act allows it to do so.
