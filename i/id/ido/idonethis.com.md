## Who can see my entries?

All of your entries on iDoneThis are private unless you choose to share them with others or the public at large. Your private entries can only be accessed with your own username and password. Your entries are not indexed by Google search or any other search engine.

If you are on a team, all of your entries on iDoneThis are private within the team. That means that your private entries can only be accessed with your username and password or that of a team member.

Your entries are not encrypted, but our policy is never to allow our site administrators to access the entries database unless to troubleshoot an issue and we never allow outsiders or contractors see the contents of our database.

## Is my personal information secure?

Your iDoneThis account is protected by your username and password. It's critically important that you protect your username and password by logging out of your account when you are finished using iDoneThis and by limiting access to your computer.

We use industry standard practices to ensure that your sensitive data is secure. Passwords are not stored, but hashed with a salt. We use Secure Sockets Layer encryption to transmit sensitive information. However, because of the nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that your information is secure from unauthorized entry or use.

We work with trusted third party services to provide our service to you. These services provide much of the infrastructure for the Internet. These services are Amazon EC2, Google Apps, and SendGrid, and they provide us with data storage and delivery.
