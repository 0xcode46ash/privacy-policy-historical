# Privacy Statement

  


### Privacy Statement

We know you take your privacy seriously. So do we. We respect your privacy and the privacy and security of the data you store with us. We have taken great efforts to keep your information confidential and secure at all times within our system. i-drive is not an "infobroker". We do not engage in the selling of the behavior, habits, or demographic information of our specific users. The information we collect on you at the site is intended to help us deliver the best and most secure service we can.

The following information explains in greater detail the steps we take to protect you and your data.

**TRUSTe Licensee**   
i-drive is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, a non-profit initiative dedicated to protecting individuals and their privacy on the Internet. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the i-drive site. When you visit a site with the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of what personally identifiable information of yours is collected, how the information is used, with whom the information may be stored, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

This Web site has agreed to participate in TRUSTe's formal resolution process. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first email our [Privacy Contact](mailto:privacy-contact@mail.idrive.com). If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at: [www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html](https://web.archive.org/mydrive/clickOut.jsp?url=http://www.truste.org/users/users_watchdog.html). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns.

**Information Collected**   
When you register for an i-drive account, we ask for your name and e-mail address. We use this data to help customize and improve the i-drive service for all of our users. We never share any of your personal information with third parties, nor do we associate this information with your usage of i-drive. We use your e-mail address to contact you, when necessary, concerning activity that is relevant to your account.

You also had the option at registration to receive our newsletter, which is distributed to keep you informed about changes to the site and new products and services we think might interest you. You may choose to stop receiving future communication from us; please refer to the Opt- Out, Delete/Deactivate section below. 

From time to time, we may collect aggregate demographic and usage data from our site. But this information is only collected and reviewed in the aggregate, meaning we will never use any personally identifiable material for any reason, at any time. The exception is when we specifically receive a complaint from a third party requesting the investigation of potentially illegal material that is publicly available in an i-drive.

**IP Addresses**   
We use your IP address, your computer's unique network identifier, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information.

**Cookies**   
We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interest and to save your password so that (if you choose) you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. 

While i-drive does not give out personally identifiable information collected from our users to others, this data may be shared with advertisers or partners on an aggregate basis (e.g., as part of a larger set of user statistics). This site contains links to other sites. i-drive is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

**Opt-Out, Delete/Deactivate**   
While i-drive does not give the users the opportunity to remove their information from our database, you may elect not to receive future communications or to discontinue use of our service. You can elect not to receive communication from i-drive directly from our Web site. As a user of i-drive, you can change your account information and preferences from the "account" section of the site, within your i-drive.

**Change/Modify**   
To change or modify the information you entered during registration:

  1. Log-in to your account at www.idrive.com 
  2. Click the "account options" link at the top of the "My Drive" section of your account. 
  3. Change and save the relevant information.



You can also add, delete and move the files in your i-drive from within the service, obviously.

 **Financial Information (credit card information)**   
As an i-drive user, you will have on occasion the opportunity to purchase products, services or additional features. i-drive may require you to provide financial information, such as credit card and expiration date. This information is used solely for billing purposes, is shared with no one, and is transferred to us on a secure, SSL encrypted transmission.

**Child Pornography Reporting Obligations**   
i-drive will comply with its obligations to report evidence of child pornography offenses to the appropriate law enforcement authorities pursuant to the Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act. Any such material will be forwarded to the appropriate law enforcement authorities upon discovery and public access will be disabled.
