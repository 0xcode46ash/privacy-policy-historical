2.4.  We as well as third party vendors and supporting advertisers may also use pixels to collect information about your visit to the Website, measure and improve the effectiveness of advertisements, and track delivery of advertising. Web Beacons collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of page view, as well as a description of the page on which the Web Beacon resides.  We may also use Web beacons in the Newsletter.  This allows us to determine if you opened or acted upon the email messages.  Because Web beacons are the same as any other content request, you cannot opt out or refuse them.  However, they can be rendered ineffective by either opting out of cookies or changing the cookie setup in your browser.
