## [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20131103000213id_/http%3A//www.idropnews.com/index.html)

iDrop will never sell our integrity. Just as importantly, we will never rent, share, or sell our subscriber list. We appreciate you letting us into your email, and we promise not to abuse that trust. We make this promise because we understand just how much you value your privacy. The policy below describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our site and/or register for iDrop. Please read this carefully. There will not be a test, but it's still important. 

**Your Information**

All we need is your email address and we will not disclose your personal information to any third party without your consent. We just really want to provide you with quality iDrop material. 

**Other Information**

In order to make our site better, we may also request other information from you. Just generic stuff -- like income level or age, that will help us tailor the site to your needs. We may also share this information with third parties, but only in aggregate, anonymous form. (For example, we might inform an advertiser that, "Our average subscriber earns $55,000/year, and is in love with Apple products as they spend 1/2 of their income on Apple gadgets.") No third party will receive information from us that personally identifies you or anyone else in any way. 

**Usage Information**

It is important for us to gather information on how our site is used: How much time do users spend on our site? What sites did they come from? What sites do they go to once they've had just about enough of our smartass attitude? All of this information is collected in aggregate form. None of it is personally identifiable. This information will not make it possible for us to corner the market on, say, frozen concentrated orange juice. It's collected only to help us to, among other things, handle traffic on iDrop, and to make sure that our service reaches you in the most efficient manner possible. 

**How to Unsubscribe**

You can unsubscribe from receiving our blast emails at any time. You can unsubscribe by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link in the footer of our email and following the instructions. You can also unsubscribe by clicking on the "Unsubscribe" link on the bottom of this site and following the instructions. 

**Third Party Advertising**

We are trying to stay profitable so we do attempt to deliver the most relevant content in forms of display/banner ads. If they are not fitting to you and you are not interested, please unsubscribe from our list. If you feel like contacting us, leave us a comment or note over email or on our facebook page. 

**Cookies**

Back in the day, a "cookie" was either something you ate, or a monumentally grating term of endearment. In Internet terminology, cookies are small text files placed on your computer, in order to help websites like ours retrieve information vital to providing the best possible service. Our cookies allow us to recognize you and simplify your user experience. iDrop will never use cookies to obtain any information from your computer not related to our site. 

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

**Links to Other Sites**

We are a content aggregator so we do use other sites' links. Partly because they allow us to guide you towards valuable products and services, and partly because there's a lot of really weird garbage out there, and exposing you to it is extremely pleasurable. However, we are not responsible for any content that appears on these sites, nor do we endorse them. For questions about these sites, please consult their individual privacy policies. 

**Security**

We take data security seriously and that's why we manage all our data internally. 

**Modifications**

We may make changes to this policy in the future, but nothing really substantial as we promise to deliver what you signed up for. If any changes occur, we will notify you in one of our newsletters. 

**Contact Us**

If you have questions about this policy, or about the site, please contact us or you could also review our Help page.
