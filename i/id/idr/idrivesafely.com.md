|  **Introduction** |   
|    
Personal privacy is taken very seriously by ContinuedEd.com. We take all necessary measures to ensure the information customers provide to us is used exclusively for the desired service. Under no circumstances is personal information sold or distributed to 3rd parties. Please read the following statement regarding our privacy policies.  |   
|  **Privacy Statement** |   
|    
ContinuedEd.com is the sole owner of the information collected from its students, users, and customers. ContinuedEd.com collects information from our users at various points throughout an online course. We will deny requests for marketing, scholastic, demographic, or other information requests from entities that could derive commercial or social benefits from such data. We will not use or sell this information to promote products or services unrelated to our driving safety courses or in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.  |   
|  **Registration** |   
|    
In order to participate in an online course, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is also required for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers in order for us to authenticate the users taking our course and prevent fraudulent use.  |   
|  **Payment** |   
|    
We request information from the user on our payment form. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user.  |   
|  **Log Files** |   
|    
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for our exclusive use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.  |   
|  **Road Rewards TM** |   
|    
If a user elects to participate in our Road Rewards™ program, we ask them to maintain an up to date address and a valid email address. ContinuedEd.com will automatically notify a user with an email prior to distributing payments associated with the rewards program. ContinuedEd.com requests updated information for the sole purpose of sending this notification.  |   
|  **Security** |   
|    
ContinuedEd.com takes every precaution to protect our user's information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. 

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing". 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our user's information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customer's information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [security@ContinuedEd.com](mailto:%20security@continueded.com "ContinuedEd.com"). 

|   
|  **Special Notifications** |   
|    
In addition to the registration and payment receipt emails that are sent to all users, we will also notify you when, according to our records, you are once again eligible for our service. Frequency will vary depending on the specific regulations in the state you reside.  |   
|  **Correction/Updating Personal Information:** |   
|    
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data provided to us. This can be done through our Road Rewards™ account access page or by emailing or calling our Customer Support (800) 723-1955.  |   
|  **Preview/No Commitment** |   
|    
Our users are given the opportunity to "demo" our site prior to payment.  |
