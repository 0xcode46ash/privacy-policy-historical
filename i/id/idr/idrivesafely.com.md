# I DRIVE SAFELY

I DRIVE SAFELY is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to enable individuals and organizations to establish trusting relationships based on respect for personal identity and information by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site **www.idrivesafely.com**. Because we want to demonstrate our commitment to our users' privacy, we have agreed to disclose our privacy practices and have them reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Customer Service by email at [privacy@idrivesafely.com](mailto:privacy@idrivesafely.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or it is not satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe through the TRUSTe Watchdog Dispute Resolution Process (<http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php>). TRUSTe will serve as a liaison with the website to resolve users concerns. 

I DRIVE SAFELY is the sole owner of the information collected on its web site. I DRIVE SAFELY collects personally identifiable information from our customers and potential affiliates at several different points on our website. We will deny requests for marketing, scholastic, demographic, or other information requests from entities that could derive commercial or social benefits from such data. We will not use or sell this information to promote products or services unrelated to this traffic safety course or in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

**Third Parties**

I DRIVE SAFELY does not provide or sell personal or demographic information about our customers to any outside third party for their own use. For example, service providers like postal services or credit card processors are not permitted to use your personal information for their own use. Information provided by our customers, or personal information obtained from public databases for validation purposes, is used exclusively for the purpose of the desired service. For testimonials we obtain consent via offline affidavit. We use a third party vendor for facilitation of our "Live Chat" process, but no information about the user is shared, and the transcripts are stored only for internal Quality Assurance purposes.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our website, or as required by law.

**Registration**

In order to use this website, a customer must first complete the registration form. During registration a customer is required to provide personal information (such as name, address, driver's license number, email, and phone number). This information is used to communicate with the customer regarding the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is also required for the customer to provide demographic information and unique identifiers in order for us to authenticate the customers taking our course and prevent fraudulent use.

**Payment**

We request information from the customer though our electronic payment submission form. Here a customer must provide contact information (like name and billing address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customer orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the customer.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track customer's movement, and gather broad demographic information for our exclusive use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. Occasionally we may need to disclose aggregate statistics from our logs, that do not contain personally identifiable information, when dealing with service providers, affiliates or business partners.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in his or her driver's license, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. This will not limit the user from any portion of the site. For this purpose our persistent cookies are tied to personal information, but do not contain or expose your personal information to others. We accumulate and report anonymous, aggregate, statistical information on our web site usage to a third party vendor for website usage analysis, but this does not contain any personally identifiable information about you. 

**Security**

This website takes every precaution to protect our customer's information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, the information is secured both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks customers to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is secured using industry leading encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are browsing a non-secure page 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect customer information offline. All of our customer's information, encompassing more than the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customer's information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

**Special Notifications**

I DRIVE SAFELY courses are designed to generate email notifications at certain intervals throughout the course. These emails are exclusively related to the products and services offered through **www.idrivesafely.com** , and may be in conjunction with services subscribed to by the customer. 

**Correcting/Updating Personal Information**

If a customer's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), we provide a way to correct or update that customer's personal data provided to us. This can be done on the "My Account" page within the course, or by emailing or calling Customer Support at 1-800-723-1955.

**Preview/No Commitment**

Our customers are given the opportunity to "demo" our site prior to payment. 

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email or by posting a notice on our website for 30 days.
