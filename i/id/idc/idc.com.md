We also analyze this data to improve our research offerings and make enhancements to the Web site.

We aggregate statistics of the type of applications used to browse our Web site and the regional source of that browsing, among IDC and other IDG companies, for analysis. This information is not personally identifiable.

Corporate Administrators at our client organizations have access to usage statistics for their account base. If your user account is part of a corporate account, then a Corporate Administrator at your company may access your user and usage information.Corporate Administrators can access user information only for individuals within their corporate profile.

Cookies

Cookies are pieces of information that are placed on your device when you visit a Web site. We use several types of cookies, and each performs different functions. The information in the cookies may be linked to personally identifying information. Cookies allow you to navigate between pages efficiently, store your preferences, and generally improve your Web experience.

However, keep in mind that deleting cookies will prevent you from using many of the features of the IDC Web site. We use cookies to maintain your log-in and access control as you move through the site. Cookies also enable us to personalize your preferences, including search, MyIDC, and "remember me."

IDC employs secure server software (SSL) encryption on all credit card transactions. The SSL encrypts all information you input before you send it to us.

Email

IDC.com requires that users provide an email address as their log-in identity when registering for an account on our Web site. This ensures a unique identity and provides IDC with a method to contact customers about service interruptions and other service-related issues.

During registration, new users may be added to the IDC.com subscriber list to receive additional communications about special IDC offers such as Web Conferences, special events, and newsletters, by checking the appropriate Contact boxes for email, phone, and/or mail. If you do not check any of the Contact boxes, you will not be included in the IDC.com subscriber list.

Once you are on the IDC.com subscriber list, you may ask to be removed at any time. You may simply click on the link that appears at the bottom of the IDC email you receive. If you would like to resubscribe, you can add your email address to our list again by signing up to be contacted on your IDC.com Profile page, or by contacting IDC Technical Support at [idc_support@idc.com](mailto:idc_support@idc.com).
