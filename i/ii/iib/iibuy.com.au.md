# Privacy Notice : iiBuy.com.au, The Ultimate bargain iBuy!

We understand that when accessing our secured online store or interacting with us online, the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information is important to you. That's why we are committed to safeguarding the personal and financial details you provide us.

The following explains what information we gather from you when you visit our online shop, how we use that information.

**The information we collect**  
Each time someone visits our site, our web server collects the following types of information: 

The number of users who visit   
The date and time of visits   
The number of pages viewed   
How users navigate through the site 

No attempts are made to identify anyone browsing our site. The data is captured so that we can accurately evaluate the quality of our online shop content and make improvements for you. 

**How we capture information**  
We use technology called cookies when you visit our site. Cookies are small pieces of information which can be stored on your hard drive (persistent cookies) or in memory (session cookies). They can record information about your visit to the site, allowing it to remember you next time you visit and provide a more meaningful experience. 

We use cookies to offer you increased security. Despite common myths, the cookies we send to your PC cannot read your hard drive, obtain any information from your browser or command your computer to perform any action. They are designed so that they cannot be sent to another site or be retrieved by any site other than iiBuy.

We may also allow third parties to collect statistical data from our site using their persistent cookies. However these cookies do not capture any information that can personally identify you. They are simply used to evaluate and measure the effectiveness of our marketing (eg sponsor banner advertising).

**How we use your information**  
The type of information we collect from you will depend on the content of your shopping cart.

When buying for our products online we may request personal information such as your name and delivery address, payment details, email address and contact phone numbers. We also tell you how we use the personal information we collect, who we give access to that information and how you can access it, if we have retained it. 

Sometimes we use third parties to run online competitions or promotions. They may require your name and email address to meet Lottery and Gaming regulations and make you eligible for entry. However, we retain ownership of this information and require that all records be deleted from the third party's database.

If you are a registered loyalty program customer with iiBuy, we may use your email address to advise you of any points upgrades or upcoming promotions that can only be redeemed by loyalty program customers. 

We may also use your email address to send regular communications about products and reviews which you have told us you are interested in. 

**Permission to contact you**  
You can choose not to receive further emails from us by withdrawing your consent. To do this, log in to shopping cart (so that we can identify you), then go to the Administration option in the main menu and de-select the box that asks for your permission to contact you. Under Administration you can also update your email address or choose the type of information we send you from the list of topics.

**Securing your information**  
When we capture your personal information it is passed through our secure server using encryption technology which scrambles the information to ensure it is protected over the Internet.

Stored information about you is further protected from unauthorised access through the use of multiple firewalls, secure passwords and sign in processes. 

**Contact us**  
If you feel that we have not lived up to our online privacy commitments or you have any queries relating to our policies, please email us. Our objective is to respond within our service standard of three working days.

As we plan to keep our statement on privacy current, this information can be subject to change. Please return periodically to review the latest on Internet privacy.
