# IIE | Privacy Policy

| 

This policy covers the treatment of all personal information that the **Institute of International Education, Inc. ("IIE")** collects when you visit our websites. At IIE, we understand that privacy is a very important issue for visitors to our website.

**INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE**

Like all website owners, IIE receives and records information from your browser in our website server logs. Whenever you request a page through your browser, the navigation and clickstream data, such as IP address, browser (and version), operating system, date, time, and the site from which you came are stored in a log file. IIE uses software programs to create summaries from these statistics for such purposes as evaluating content worth, Website and system administration, and anonymous user analysis. This information cannot be used to identify specific individuals.

Aside from this standard tracking data, the only other personal information our site collects about you is such data as you knowingly provide to us, such as when signing up for _My IIE_. IIE is the sole owner of any information collected on this site. We will not sell, market, share, rent or otherwise distribute this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. We will only release personal information to another person or company with your consent or to the extent required by law.

In addition, IIE will not sell, market, share, rent or otherwise distribute any information provided to us by our donors to any third parties, except as required by law. Donors to IIE may contact the Development Office at any time regarding their personal information and to request corrections to such information.

Keeping your personal information secure is a top priority for IIE. Personal information is private and confidential; accordingly, the information provided is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated employees, trained in the proper handling of customer information, and is used only for the purpose for which the information is collected. Whenever IIE should hire other organizations to provide support services, we will require them to conform to our privacy standards and allow us to audit them for compliance.

**EXTERNAL LINKS**

This website may contain links to other sites. Unless we expressly state otherwise, IIE makes no representations whatsoever concerning the content of those sites. The fact that IIE has provided a link to a site is not an endorsement, authorization, sponsorship, or affiliation with respect to such site, its owners, or its providers. There are risks associated with using any information, software, or products found on the Internet, and IIE cautions you to make sure that you understand these risks before retrieving, using, relying upon, or purchasing anything via the Internet. In addition, we encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. These other sites may collect or solicit personal data or send their own cookies to your computer. Please be aware that IIE is not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. This policy applies to all webpages under our domains and not to any webpages not under our domains, regardless of any hyperlinks from a webpage under our domains to a webpage not under our domains. Please check the privacy statements of these other sites for more information about their policies on collection and use of personal information.

**NOTE TO PARENTS AND CHILDREN**

IIE is concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our website users. We are particularly respectful of the privacy of our young users. We encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Internet and to help us protect their privacy by instructing them never to provide personal information on this site or any other without permission. We will never attempt to extract unnecessary information from our users, regardless of age.

**CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY**

IIE may amend this privacy policy from time to time. If we make any significant changes in the way we use your personal information, we will alert you by posting a prominent notice on our site.

**QUESTIONS OR SUGGESTIONS**

It is important to us at IIE to hear what visitors have to say about our services or our policies. If site visitors have any questions, concerns, or complaints about this privacy policy or want to let us know what they think about our services, please contact us using the following information:
