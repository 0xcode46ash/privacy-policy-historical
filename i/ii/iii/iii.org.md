**Site Usage Information:**

We also collect aggregate tracking information derived mainly from tallying page views throughout the Site, enabling us to review your activity on the Site in anonymous or aggregated form. Our Web server automatically recognizes and collects the domain name and IP address of visitors to the Site. We may use ‘cookies’ to enhance your online experience with the Insurance Information Institute. A 'cookie' is a small file that your Web browser will place on your hard drive. It allows us to remember you and keep track of your preferences and passwords. Use of cookies allows us to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. You can, of course, set your browser to reject cookies—but keep in mind that this may affect the experience you have on the Site.]

**_PROTECTION OF INFORMATION_**

We make reasonable efforts to protect personal information received from Site users against unauthorized use or disclosure.

Site-tracking and usage information we collect is used to improve the Site and the Insurance Information Institute services.

**_DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION_**

**Sharing with Affiliated Organizations and Vendors:**

Organizations other than the Insurance Information Institute may be engaged by the Insurance Information Institute to perform a variety of functions, including providing technical and hosting services for the Site.

**Sharing with Third Parties:**

We may disclose user personal information provided on the Site as reasonably necessary to respond to or implement the user's request. Other than as provided above, we do not disclose user personal information provided on the Site to third parties unless we reasonably believe that the law requires it, that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, the rights of another user or person, or to prevent harm.
