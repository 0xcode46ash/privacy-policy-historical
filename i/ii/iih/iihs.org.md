# Privacy policy for iihs.org site

* * *

Thank you for visiting the website of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and the Highway Loss Data Institute. This privacy policy explains our online information practices.

We use two applications for tracking web statistics, WebTrends and Google Analytics. When you enter our site, WebTrends automatically collects from your browser the following information:

  * IP address from which you access our website (an IP address is a number automatically assigned to a computer whenever it connects to the web);
  * type of browser and operating system used to access our site;
  * date and time you access our site;
  * pages you visit; and
  * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that site.



In addition, Google Analytics runs a bit of code in your browser that sends the above information, as well as more detailed information such as your screen resolution. Google's use of these data is covered by its own [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/privacy.html). _None of the information collected by either application identifies you personally._

We use the information we collect to count the number visitors to the different pages on our site and to help us make our site more useful. This type of information is retained indefinitely.

If you contact us via email, we use your personal information (such as email, telephone number, and/or postal address) to respond to your request. We do not provide your personal information to other organizations.

The Institute sells its consumer videos and DVDs through an outside vendor, 2Checkout.com. Sales are guaranteed secure. Please see 2Checkout.com's own [privacy policy](https://www2.2checkout.com/documentation/privacy_feb7_2005.htm) for more information.

Our website includes links to federal agencies and other highway-safety organizations. When you link to another site, you are no longer on our site and subject to the privacy policy of the new site your are visiting. The Institute does not endorse any information or services offered by these external sites; it only provides these links as a service to you.

If you have any further questions, please contact [permissions@iihs.org](mailto:permissions@iihs.org).
