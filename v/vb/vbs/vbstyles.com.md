This page is designed to detail what information we collect from you, and how we handle that information.

The amount of information we collect depends on what you are doing. For those just browsing our website, our webserver automatically records the following information:  
\- Browser and operating system  
\- IP address  
\- Screen resolution  
\- Referrer  
This information is used in aggregate to determine where users are coming to our site from, what country users are located in, and what type of browser and operating system they are using. (IP addresses are resolved to determine what country they are located in, and then discarded.) This information helps us improve the site for everyone.

If you are a customer of vBStyles.com, the following information is collected:  
\- Name and email address  
\- Billing address  
\- IP address (at the time of purchase, and at the time of each download of the software)  
This information is held in the strictest confidence, and is only shared with the payment processor you select. (Currently the options are 2Checkout.com and PayPal.) The payment processor uses the information to process your payment. Your credit card number, expiration date, CCV2 number, and/or bank account details are collected by the payment processor and are _not_ shared with vBStyles.com.  
This information is used for the purposes of processing and fulfilling your order; for tracking how many downloads a customer makes, and where he makes them from; and for sending you notices when new versions of the product are released and when your access to downloads is about to expire.

Cookies are largely misunderstood by the general internet browsing population, because of years of scaremongering by various companies more interested in selling their product than telling the truth. Cookies are small text files that sit on your computer with bits of information in them. They cannot provide any information to us that you do not provide knowingly, and they cannot read any files on your hard drive or other information. We use cookies for two purposes:  
\- If you come from certain websites, we may set a referrer cookie. If you purchase vBStyles.com vBulletin Skin/s, this information is then stored to help us determine where sales are coming from, and to pay affiliate sellers.  
\- If you use the forums, support system, bug tracker, and/or Members Area, several cookies will be set that keep you logged into these areas without having to retype your username and password to login to different areas. You can logout, and thereby have these cookies destroyed, by clicking the Member Logout button that appears in the header of every page after logging in.

We take your privacy very seriously and do not share your information with anyone, except as described above. If you have any questions regarding this policy, please contact us at [info@vbstyles.com](mailto:info@vbstyles.com).
