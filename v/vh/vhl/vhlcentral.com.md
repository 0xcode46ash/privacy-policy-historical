INFORMATION VISTA HIGHER LEARNING COLLECTS.

Vista Higher Learning gathers certain personal information about all users during the registration and technical support process for the VHL Digital Products. Information collected from instructors during this process will include full name, e-mail address, year of birth, school affiliation, user name and one password. An instructor's school affiliation includes country (if non-US only), state/province (if within the US), time zone, school type, and full institutional name.

Information collected during the student registration and technical support process will include full name and e-mail address, age, and a VHL Central Site user name and passcode. The student also has the option to provide a Student ID. A student's school information, which includes country (if non-US only), state/province (if within the US), time zone, school type, full institutional name, and course/class enrollment status may also be collected.

Once the registration process is complete, the VHL Digital Products offer users the ability to correct or change some of the above personal information. Users may update or review such information at any time by selecting the "My Account" link within a registered VHL Central Site account.

In addition, some VHL Digital Products offer instructors and students the ability to complete substantive course work on such sites, including the ability to upload documents and submit communications on such sites. Some VHL Digital Products offer instructors the ability to store student grade information on such sites. Contact Vista Higher Learning for specific products that offer these services.

Vista Higher Learning has engaged Hudson Software Corporation ("Hudson") and AltaVista (“AltaVista”) to provide technical support regarding use of the VHL Digital Products. Hudson and AltaVista may request information from or about you in order to provide technical support that you request. AltaVista and Hudson have agreed to abide by Vista Higher Learning’s Privacy Policy. However, Vista Higher Learning urges you to contact AltaVista and Hudson regarding their practices prior to disclosing any information to AltaVista or Hudson, as Vista Higher Learning is not responsible for AltaVista’s or Hudson's implementation of their privacy and security practices.

**General**

Certain identifying information is automatically collected when you visit the VHL Digital Products, including the IP address from which a VHL Central Site is accessed. We may collect identifying information that allows us to track the number of visitors we receive and the way they navigate through the VHL Digital Products. The types of identifying information collected include the date and time you accessed a VHL Central Site, the page or pages you visited and images you accessed, the website you arrived to the VHL Central Site from and the website that you depart to as well as the IP address of the computer being used to access the VHL Central Site. We may use IP addresses and anonymous demographic information in the aggregate to share with advertisers and market researchers, and to improve the design of the VHL Digital Products to better serve our customers and otherwise for Vista Higher Learning business purposes. While it may be possible to correlate this information to particular individuals, we do not generally do so. We may share this aggregated information with other third parties. We reserve the right to analyze anonymous demographic information or otherwise correlate it to particular individuals in order to investigate potentially unlawful conduct and/or breaches of this Privacy Policy. For example, we may report to appropriate school and law enforcement authorities any IP addresses and correlated email address that is associated with multiple unsuccessful code redemption attempts.

**User Name and Password Information**

If you lose or forget your login information, you may contact us and ask us to change your password to a temporary password. You authorize us to, upon request, send your login information to your email address of record. This means that if you give someone else access to your email, they might have access to your account. **Further, we may provide secondary school instructors with a method of resetting a student's password for students who have indicated to us that they are enrolled at the instructor's school. This means that, if you are a secondary school student, it is possible for instructors at your school to view your VHL Central Site account.** We will not knowingly provide instructor login information to any student.

**Disclosures of Information to third parties**

We may share nonpublic personal information with affiliates and other third parties that assist us in providing our services or products or otherwise responding to your requests or orders. Vista Higher Learning may transfer any information in its databases, including but not limited to nonpublic personal information, to an affiliate or third party as part of a transfer of business assets.

Vista Higher Learning may also release nonpublic personal information in special cases in order to comply with requests from law enforcement and government agencies, to protect Vista Higher Learning's rights and to protect customers and others and otherwise as permitted or required by law. We may do so when we believe in good faith that disclosing this information is otherwise necessary or advisable, including, for instance, to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interfering with the rights or property of Vista Higher Learning, another user, a school with whom any user is associated, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. This includes reporting unsuccessful code redemption attempts and other related information to appropriate school and law enforcement authorities.

**Links to Other Sites**

Vista Higher Learning may provide links to other websites for your convenience. Vista Higher Learning does not endorse and is not responsible for any third party websites, products, services or business practices.

If you suspect that your password has been compromised, please contact Vista Higher Leaning immediately.

**General**

While Vista Higher Learning strives to protect nonpublic personal information and takes reasonable steps to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of such information disclosed to us, we cannot guarantee the security, integrity or confidentiality of any information you disclose and you do so at your own risk.

COOKIES & INTERNET BROWSER SETTINGS

We use cookies. "Cookies" are small pieces of data that can be stored by an Internet browser for visitor tracking purposes. Cookies cannot access your hard drive or send information about your computer system. Cookies are just simply a data storage system. We use them to study visitors' use of the VHL Digital Products and to improve our services for you. Most Web browsers accept cookies, but the "help" menu on your browser should give you options for preventing, accepting, or receiving notice of new cookies. You can configure your web-browser to disable cookies, but doing so will impair your use of the VHL Digital Products. Vista Higher Learning requires that its customers configure Internet browsers to enable session cookies from the VHL Digital Products in order to use the VHL Digital Products.

CHILDREN

The VHL Digital Products are not generally intended for children under the age of 13, but in some instances children under the age of 13 may be eligible users of certain VHL Digital Products. If that is the case, Vista Higher Learning will not sell any of its products or services directly to children under the age of 13, and instead such purchase must be made by the child’s parent or legal guardian or school, and that purchaser must assist the child in registering the product or service for use. Any information that may be needed for delivery of the product or service, but may not be legally collected from a child under the age of 13, must be provided by the child’s parent or legal guardian or with the consent of a parent or legal guardian. If you have reason to believe that we have collected nonpublic personal information from someone under 13 years of age without having obtained the authorizations described above, please let us know.
