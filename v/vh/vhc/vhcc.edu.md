·         VHCC does not currently use cookies, but may set and access VHCC cookies on your computer.

_A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. _

Each web site can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's  preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a web site to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. 

## Choices about Cookies

You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or  notify you when a cookie is set. (Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.)

  * In certain areas VHCC uses standard e-mail or databases to store data transmissions.


  * VHCC may edit this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our pages.
