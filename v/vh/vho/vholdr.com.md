# VholdR Privacy Notice | VholdR

Updated as of July 23, 2008

The Twenty20 Privacy Policy describes how Twenty20, Inc and its subsidiaries collect and treat personal information when you use our services, including information provided when you use VholdR.com and VholdR Desktop. The following describes privacy practices specific to VholdR.com and VholdR Desktop. To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use VholdR, you should read this Twenty20 Privacy Policy.

  


### The Information We Collect

You can watch videos on VholdR.com without having a VholdR.com Account. You can also contact us about a particular video without having an account. However, in order to take advantage of other activities on VholdR.com —like uploading videos, posting comments, flagging videos, or watching restricted videos—we require you to have a VholdR.com Account. 

  * **Depending on your use of our site, you will provide two types of information: personal information you knowingly choose to disclose that is collected by us and information automatically collected by us as you interact with VholdR.com or VholdR Desktop.**

  * **Information you provide.** We ask for some personal information when you create a VholdR.com Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. Your account name along with any video content that you voluntarily disclose online (on discussion boards, in messages and chat areas, within your playback or profile pages, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and accessed by others. **  
**

  *   

  * **Information automatically provided.** We may record non-personal information (such as cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) about your usage, such as when you use VholdR.com, the channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with, the videos you watch, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in VholdR.com (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account. 

  *   




### **How We Use the Information We Collect**

  * If you submit personally identifiable information to us through VholdR.com or VholdR Desktop, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the general and personalized features and functionality of the VholdR applications, and to process any flagging activity or correspondence you send to us.

  * Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the VholdR.com and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the VholdR Sites may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public. 

  * We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent unless that use is part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major VholdR Site changes or for customer service purposes). 

  * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information to improve the quality and design of the VholdR Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, analyzing, and processing user preferences and trends, as well as user activity and communications. We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. "Web Beacons") in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients.

  * We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the VholdR Sites; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests. If you download VholdR Desktop, your copy of the software includes a unique application number. The unique application number and information about your installation of the software (e.g. version number, language) will be sent to VholdR.com when VholdR Desktop automatically checks for updates.




### **Your Choices**

  * You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the VholdR Sites, in which case you can still view videos and explore the VholdR Sites, but VholdR may not be able to provide certain services to you. Some advanced VholdR features may, for authentication purposes, require you to sign up for other services. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information associated with them.

  *   

  * You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page.

  * You may clear your viewing history at any time through the "Viewing History" feature.




### **Children Under Age 13**

Twenty20 does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register with Vholdr.com or VholdR Desktop or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to Twenty20 or on Vholdr.com. In the event we learn that we have collected personal from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us as **[support@vholdr.com](mailto:support@vholdr.com)**.

We recommend that minors over the age of 13 ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

### **Third-party Advertisers**

VholdR allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within the VholdR Sites. These third-party ad servers or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your browser, the advertisements and links that appear on the VholdR Sites. They automatically receive your IP address when this happens. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or Web Beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content you see. Twenty20 does not have access to or control of these technologies that may be used by third-party advertisers. 

Third-party advertisers do not have access to or control over any of the personal information you provide on VholdR.com. Twenty20 does not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers or ad networks without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. However, please note that if an advertiser asks VholdR to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 18-24 who have viewed certain channels of content) and you respond to that advertisement, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. The advertiser may also use information regarding your use of the VholdR Sites, such as the number of times you viewed an ad (but not any personally identifiable information), to determine which ads to deliver to you.

You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-party ad servers or ad networks (see links below) for more information on their practices and for instructions on how to opt-out of certain practices. 

### **Links to Other Sites**

Vholdr.com may contain links to third-party sites. Twenty20’s Privacy Policy only governs information collected on Vholdr.com’s website. This privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of other web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and link to another site and to read the privacy policy stated on those site. 

### **Terms of Service, Notices and Revisions**

Your use of Vholdr.com and VholdR Desktop, and any disputes arising from them, are subject to this Privacy Policy as well as our Terms of Service and all of its dispute resolution provisions including limitation on damages and choice of law. 

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service at any time. Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on this site. If we make changes, we will post them and indicate at the top of this page the policy’s new effective date.

If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on our home page. We encourage you to refer to this policy and our Terms of Service on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current policies. Unless stated otherwise, our current privacy policy applies to all information that we have about you and your account.
