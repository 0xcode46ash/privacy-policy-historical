The VMJunction Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use VMJunction's products and services, including information provided when you use VMJunction. In addition, the following describes our privacy practices that are specific to VMJunction.

 **Personal information**

You need a VMJunction Account to access VMJunction. VMJunction asks for some personal information when you create a VMJunction Account, including your alternate contact information and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A VMJunction Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration. 

VMJunction stores, processes and maintains your messages, contact lists and other data related to your account in order to provide the service to you. 

When you use VMJunction, VMJunction's servers automatically record certain information about your use of VMJunction. Similar to other web services, VMJunction records information such as account activity (including storage usage, number of log-ins), data displayed or clicked on (including UI elements, ads, links); and other log information (including browser type, IP-address, date and time of access, cookie ID, and referrer URL). 

**Uses**

VMJunction maintains and processes your VMJunction account and its contents to provide the VMJunction service to you and to improve our services. 

VMJunction's computers process the information in your messages for various purposes, including formatting and displaying the information to you, delivering advertisements and related links, preventing unsolicited bulk email (spam), backing up your messages, and other purposes relating to offering you VMJunction. 

VMJunction may send you information related to your VMJunction account or other VMJunction services. 

**Information sharing and onward transfer**

When you send email, VMJunction includes information such as your email address and the email itself as part of that email. 

We do not sell, rent or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties until and unless we are required to do so by law.
