**An Overview**

Vvdailypress.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.vvdailypress.com. It is Vvdailypress.comâ€™s policy to use its best efforts to respect the privacy of its online visitors.

While this privacy policy applies to the Vvdailypress.com site and all of the other Internet-accessible Vvdailypress.com-branded services, we will refer here only to VV.com to make reading this policy easier. The purpose of this VV.com privacy policy is to inform you, as a welcome visitor to VV.com, what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit VV.com, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, the information. Finally, please note that this policy applies only to VV.com and Web sites that carry the VV.com brand, and not to other companies' or organizations' Web sites to which we link. We have clearly marked VV.com and these branded Web sites with our logo so you know where this policy applies. 

**Information About All Vvdailypress.com Visitors  
**In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visitors to VV.com and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in the aggregate. This collective data helps us determine how much our customers use parts of the site, so we can improve our site to assure that it is as appealing as we can make it for as many of you as possible. We also may provide statistical "ratings" information, never information about you personally, to our VV.com partners about how our members, collectively, use VV.com. We do this so they too can understand how much people use their areas and our site in order for them to provide you with the best possible Web experience as well. 

**Information About You  
**Sometimes, we may specifically ask for information about you when you sign up to use a service or when you order a product. We will need certain information -- such as name, Internet address or screen name, billing address, type of computer, credit card number -- in order to provide that service or product to you. We may also use that information to let you know of additional products and services about which you might be interested. You can choose not to receive such information if you don't want to by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose to opt out. Additionally, we may provide you with an opportunity to be listed in a directory on one of our VV.com - branded services -- these listings are also optional and you can make changes to or eliminate this information when you want to.

**Disclosure  
**We do not use or disclose information about your individual visits to VV.com or information that you may give us, such as your name, address, email address or telephone number, to any outside companies. But as we mention above, we may share with our Web site partners aggregated statistical "ratings" information about the use of VV.com. 

**Public Forums  
**This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, news groups and/or other interactive features available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

**Vvdailypress.com Privacy Policy Changes  
**If we decide to change our privacy policy for VV.com, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. Vvdailypress.com Privacy Policy
