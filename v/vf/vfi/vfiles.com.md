# VFILES | Privacy Policy

**The Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
When you visit the Site, you provide us with two types of information:/ personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**  
If you create a user profile with us, we’ll ask you to provide basic information about yourself that could be used to identify you, such as your name, your e-mail address, your telephone number, your address, and/or a photograph of yourself (together, “Profile Information”). We also collect and store information you place on your user profile (e.g. information about your favorite designers, your personal style) and information contained in messages you send to other VFiles.com users. If you connect to VFiles.com through a third-party social networking website like Facebook or Twitter, we may also use personal information from those profiles. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of the above information as “Personal Information.” 

With respect to Profile Information, we will display Profile Information to other VFiles.com users in order to allow you to connect with other VFiles.com users. Of course, you can choose your own privacy settings, which can restrict the amount of Profile Information that can be seen or accessed by other VFiles.com users. If you have any questions about how to change your privacy settings, drop us a note at privacy@vfiles.com. 

We use Personal Information to customize your experience within the Site. For example, we use Personal Information to provide you with recommendations for specific Content available on the Site, to allow you to easily return to posts and messages made by you or other Site users, and to return to searches that you’ve conducted within the Site. We will never intentionally share your personally identifiable information with any third party without first obtaining your permission to do so. 

On occasion, we may also use your Personal Information to contact you with our newsletters, marketing or promotional materials, or other information that we think would be of interest to you. You can tell us to stop sending these kinds of communications to you at any time, either by updating your “preferences” information in your account settings, or by following the “unsubscribe” instructions provided in any of the communications we send you. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
When you enter the Site, we automatically collect information about your browser type and your Internet Protocol (IP) address(es), as well as information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website (for example, websites you might have visited before you visited the Site, the amount of time you spend on those sites). We also collect information that you provide to us when you sign up to use the Site that cannot reasonably be used to identify or contact you – such information includes information about the various demographic groups you fall into (e.g. age group, income group, etc.), as well as information relating to your use of the Site (e.g. the types of Content you search for on the Site, the times of day you access the Site, etc.). In this Privacy Policy, we refer to all of the above as “Non-Personally Identifiable Information.” 

We use Non-Personally Identifiable Information in the aggregate to monitor the web site, to improve the web site’s offerings, to customize your experience with the Site, and for targeted advertising. Advertising is conducted by third parties, who will have access to your IP address when their ads are displayed on the page you are viewing. These third parties have no access to your personally identifiable information unless you’ve chosen to share it with them. 

**Cookies**  
We use “cookies,” which are small text files that are stored on your computer that retain your information and preferences relative to your activities on the website. They are meant to enhance your experience on the Site, and are used primarily to recognize registered users who are logged on. For example, if you tell us to, we will send a cookie to your machine that remembers your login credentials to the Site, so you don’t have to enter them every time you access the Site. 

Should you wish to prevent your computer from accepting cookies from the Site, you can change the settings on your web browser to either block cookies sent from the web site, or to disable cookies altogether. Please note that the Site may not function properly, or may function differently, if you choose not to receive cookies. 

**Other Permitted Uses of Your Information**  
We have the right to provide your information to third parties such as web hosting companies to the extent it is necessary to keep the Site up and operating. We have the right to disclose and transfer user lists and related personally identifiable information in connection with any merger, sale or contemplated sale of all or part of our business related to the web site, and to treat such information as a business asset in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation. We may also disclose personally identifiable information to a third party if disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, court order, and/or other legal instrument, legal proceeding or relevant law, or if there is an immediate, imminent threat to the safety of any person, VFiles or the Site. 

**Editing Information**  
You may edit or delete any information provided to us at any time by editing your user profile. To delete your account entirely, please e-mail contact@vfiles.com. 

**Privacy**  
In order to protect your information, we use industry-standard security methods such as firewalls, encryption security layers and secured socket layers. We also permit you to create your own privacy settings, in order to control the specific information that is available to other users of the Site. However, no security measures are perfect, and we therefore cannot guarantee that the steps we have taken to secure your information will prevent our systems from being compromised and/or your information from being disclosed. 

With respect to information you choose to share on the Site, you essentially control your own destiny. You can change the Privacy Settings for your profile so that certain information that you share is not accessible by the general public or by other users. However, keep in mind that the Privacy Settings cannot be used to keep everything private – by way of example, if you comment upon VFiles Content (as defined in the Terms of Use), those comments will be accessible to any registered user of the Site. Moreover, even if you delete content that you post on the Site, other users may have already downloaded or otherwise kept that content, and the content could potentially be accessible through archived pages of the Site. It’s very important that you think carefully before you post any private information to the Site. If you have any questions about how to keep your information private on the Site, please e-mail us at privacy@vfiles.com, and we’ll do our best to help. 

**Links**  
We may contain links to websites that are not affiliated with VFiles, and whose data security and privacy policies may differ from this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the privacy policies employed by third party sites. We encourage you to review the privacy statements of any site that is accessed from the site so that you will be aware of how each visited site collects, uses and distributes information. 

**Children Under the Age of 13**  
VFiles.com is designed solely for users over the age of 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect any information about users who may be under the age of 13, and will delete any information provided by such individuals as soon as possible. Please do not provide us with any personal information if you are under the age of 13. 

We do allow users between the ages of 13 and 18 to use the site. However, such users should discuss the use of VFiles.com or any other social networking site with their parents before they submit, share or post any content to the Site.
