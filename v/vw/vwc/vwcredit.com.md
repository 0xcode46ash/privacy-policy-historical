###### OUR COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this Privacy Policy, which explains our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this Privacy Policy easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable data may be requested.

This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected or submitted on the vw.com website. On some pages, you can order products, make requests, and register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages include:

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email address
  * Survey questions
  * Phone number
  * Credit card/Debit card information



On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient’s address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected may include:  


  * Name
  * Address
  * Phone Number  




###### HOW WE USE INFORMATION

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We may use your email address to communicate with you, for example, to notify you of special offers or programs you might find of interest.

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery.

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We may also use these email addresses to provide order status and order tracking information, and to respond to queries.

We may offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our catalog as well as updates on our new products and services.  


We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and share with our advertising agencies. For example, we may tell an advertising agency that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to personally identify those individuals.

If you choose to register or receive products or materials from us, or to otherwise give us personal information, we may store some or all of that personal information and use it for marketing research and marketing purposes, which may include sharing it with Volkswagen or Audi authorized dealerships or with various suppliers that provide marketing, research, or other services for us. If you choose to save information, such as a vehicle configuration, on our website(s), we may contact you to follow up on your interest in our cars. In such cases, we may employ an outside research company to call you on our behalf.

You may also use your Facebook account credentials to sign in to our website. If you connect to our website using your Facebook credentials, you authorize us to collect your authentication information, such as your username, access credentials, and other information that may be available on or through your Facebook account, including your name, country, email address, and date of birth.

We will never sell your personal information to any other company.

In the event of a criminal investigation or a suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain personal information.

Finally, we never use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

###### A WORD ON "COOKIES"

"Cookies" are small items of data that some websites either write to your hard drive upon your visit to their site(s) or store in the browser. These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. Some of our websites may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests. In this way, we can deliver tailor-made information suiting your personal interests upon your next visit to our site(s). Our use of "cookie" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.

###### PIXEL TAGS

We may use "pixel tags," which are small graphic files that allow us to monitor the use of our websites. A pixel tag can collect information such as the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the computer that downloaded the page on which the tag appears; the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) of the page on which the pixel tag appears; the time the page containing the pixel tag was viewed; the type of browser that fetched the pixel tag; and the identification number of any cookie (please see A Word On "Cookies") on the computer previously placed by that server. When corresponding with you via HTML-capable email, we may use "format sensing" technology, which allows pixel tags to let us know whether you received and opened our email.

###### OUR COMMITMENT TO DATA SECURITY

Because your privacy is important to us, we have installed safeguards to secure the credit card information we collect online. Our e-commerce site uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology supported by Microsoft Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator/Communicator, and other popular browsers to protect your online transactions. SSL encrypts your credit card number, name, address, and phone number before they travel over the Internet. We also use additional technologies and measures to prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure appropriate use of this information.

###### OUR COMMITMENT TO CHILDREN’S PRIVACY

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.  


######  EXTERNAL LINKS

The VW.com website may contain links to other websites, including social networks, advertisers, individual dealer’s websites, and websites belonging to other third parties. Such sites may include social media sites, such as Facebook. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies provided by other websites before you provide personal information to them.
