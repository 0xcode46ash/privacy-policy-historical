**SSL** Our current security technology is Secured Socket Layer (SSL). The SSL protocol provides connection security that has three basic properties:

* The peer's identity can be authenticated using asymmetric, or public key, cryptography (e.g., RSA[RSA], DSS[DSS], etc.). 
* The connection is reliable. Message transport includes a message integrity check using a keyed MAC. Secure hash functions (e.g., SHA, MD5, etc.) are used for MAC computations. We reserve the right to change this privacy policy at any time.
