We use the personal information you provide for the purposes that we identify when we ask you to provide the information.

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We may use your e-mail address to communicate with you, for example, to notify you of special offers or programs you might find of interest. 

We use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order only to ship the product and to confirm delivery. 

We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We may also use these e-mail addresses to provide order status and order tracking information, and to respond to queries. 

We may offer gift-cards by which you can personalize a product you order for another person. Information you provide to us to create a gift-card is only used for that purpose, and it is only disclosed to the person receiving the gift.

We will never sell your personal information to any other company. In the event of a criminal investigation or a suspected illegal activity, we may be required by law enforcement agencies to share certain personal information. 

Finally, we never use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the purposes described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
