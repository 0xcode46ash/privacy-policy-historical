## Applicant Statement

**As amended 13/10/2003**

### THE APPLICANT POLICY

At VTAC we believe an individual's right to keep their personal information private is highly important. We are committed to protecting and maintaining the privacy, accuracy and security of your personal and application information.

### HOW AND WHAT INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We will only collect information relevant to your application for a tertiary course or courses.

The information we collect will include:

  * Contact and personal details relevant to your application or the institution to which you are applying; residential status; current or previous Year 12 and tertiary results.
  * To assist institutions with enrolments and/or special programs VTAC will also collect information about languages spoken at home, place of birth and ethnicity.
  * Additionally and on behalf of institutions we ask that you indicate whether or not you have a disability. The choice to answer this question is option and your response is not used as part of the selection process, but rather to ensure that you have adequate access to support services.



While we will collect most of this information directly from you, we will endeavour to obtain any Australian Year 12 results or Australian University results directly from the university or respective database.

When you speak to us about your application, we will minimise the opportunity for other people to overhear our discussion.

### HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

We will limit use of your personal information to:

  * Carrying out our business which includes confirming the data contained within your application, confirming past and/or current results, distributing your application onto the institution and courses to which you have applied, notifying you of cancelled courses, change of preference and offers. 
  * If you are a current VCE or Victorian IB Year 12 student your personal information and results will also be used to calculate an ENTER or Notional ENTER for tertiary entrance. 
  * Once VTAC has obtained your Year 12 results, they will be stored on a national database. Access to this database is restricted to the Director or (nominee) of any state-based tertiary admission centre and only if you have initiated an application for a tertiary course.



**Consideration of Chronic Circumstances**  
If you are a current year 12 student and submit an Application for Consideration of Chronic Circumstances form, then only the Deputy Director, Selection and Applications (or their nominee) and course authorities associated with your final list of preferences will have access to this information.

**VTAC Pi Form**

  * If you are a Non-year 12 applicant and complete the VTAC Pi form, this form will be distributed to all courses for which you have applied.
  * If you are a current year 12 student this form will only be circulated by VTAC to selection authorities of all courses which you have listed on your VTAC application.



**Grade Point Average**

A Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated:

  * If you have completed tertiary studies and 
  * The course or institution to which you are currently applying to has a published policy on its use in selection.
  * GPA information will not be verbally available either by telephone or in person at VTAC.



To obtain a copy of your GPA, you must complete the appropriate request form and pay the associated administrative fee. A GPA will not be calculated for you if your course or institution does not have a published policy on its use as part of selection.

A GPA will not be calculated for you if your course or institution does not have a published policy on its use as part of selection.
