The institutions that participate in VTAC are committed to observing the VTAC Code of Privacy and Ethics. This code is designed to protect the rights of you, the applicant, institutions and the Victorian Tertiary Admissions Centre (VTAC).

## What VTAC collects and why

### All applicants

  1. The information we collect will include contact details, personal details, residential status, current or previous Year 12 and tertiary results. 
  2. To assist institutions with enrolments and/or special programs VTAC will also collect information about languages spoken at home, place of birth and ethnicity. 
  3. On behalf of institutions we ask that you indicate whether or not you have a disability. The choice to answer this question is optional and your response is not used as part of the selection process, but rather to ensure that you have adequate access to support services. 
  4. Once you have applied we will endeavour to obtain any previous Australian Year 12 results or Australian university results directly from the respective state databases or university. 
  5. With regard to university results, a Grade Point Average (GPA) is calculated: 
    * if you undertake university studies in Australia and 
    * if VTAC has been able to access the results electronically via the Automated Results Transfer Scheme (ARTS) or if you have supplied detailed paper transcripts of results.



### Current Year 12 students 

  * In order to establish and maintain the VTAC applicant file and VTAC CourseLink (web based course information and counselling program), we collect personal information from the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority (VCAA) on:
    * students undertaking one or more VCE units of study;
    * International Baccalaureate (IB) students (undertaking the General Achievement Test); and 
    * students undertaking one or more VCAL units of study



## What information is used?

We will limit use of your personal information to carrying out business which includes confirming the data contained within your application, confirming past and/or current results, distributing your application to the institutions and courses to which you have applied, notifying you of cancelled courses, change of preference and offers. 

Using the results received from the VCAA, VTAC calculates an ENTER or notional ENTER for tertiary entrance for eligible VCE students and Victorian IB students.

While current and previous Year 12 results are stored on a national database, this information can only be accessed, by the Director (or nominee) of any state-based tertiary admission centre if you initiate an application for tertiary study within that state. 

The Grade Point Average (GPA) will be used as stated under each published course or institutional selection mode. Refer to the VTAC website at www.vtac.edu.au for further information.

## Who has access to your information?

### All applicants

  * We distribute your personal information to institutions to which you have applied for the purpose of application, Special Entry Access Schemes and selection only. Institutions are not permitted to sell or trade your information without your express permission.
  * We will not share, sell or trade your personal information to any institution to which you have not applied. 
  * We may use your information to conduct research; however at no time is personal or sensitive data made available to any person or authority outside of VTAC without your permission.
  * We do allow your information to be provided to other select organisations that perform certain functions or operations for us. We bind these companies to the same standard of care as we do ourselves so that they cannot provide this information to anyone else. 
  * We enforce these requirements through contractual agreements.



### Current Year 12 Students 

  * As the year progresses, VTAC will distribute your course preference data, ENTER and offer details to your school for the purposes of information i.e. student reports and counselling.
  * We distribute your ENTER to the Victorian Curriculum and Assessment Authority to assist them in confirming the Premiers Awards. 



## Rights and Responsibilities 

### You have a right to:

  1. Express or change your preferences freely within the defined period (providing at least three working days have passed since you paid your processing fees) without any pressure from institutions.
  2. Consider any offer of a place made through VTAC without being contacted directly by any institution. Verbal offers should be ignored.
  3. Decide whether your offer will be published in metropolitan and regional newspapers.
  4. A refund of institutional fees, less an administrative fee, if you cancel an enrolment in the event of a more acceptable offer.
  5. Access most of the personal information we hold about you and request corrections. This right is subject to existing or anticipated legal proceedings.
  6. Request information by telephoning, e-mailing or visiting the office of VTAC provided you can identify yourself as the applicant.

  8. Advise VTAC if you do not want your ENTER and Year 12 results stored on a national database. Only after you have initiated an application to an institution participating in one of the state based systems, will your data be made available to the Director (or nominee) of the said admission centre. 
  9. Additionally, if you are a current year 12 student, you have the right to advise VTAC if you do not want your preference, offer and ENTER data forwarded to your school for the purpose of course information and counselling.



### You must:

  1. Supply full and correct information as part of the application process. Please note that VTAC and the participating institutions have the right to vary or cancel an application or enrolment made on the basis of what VTAC or a participating institution determines to be untrue or incomplete information from any source. 
  2. Understand that VTAC, on behalf of the participating institutions, makes offers based on the information provided by you and on advice received from VTAC. If a participating institution subsequently finds that the information or advice was incorrect, it may withdraw the offer 
  3. Confirm that the information you have included on your application is correct and notify VTAC immediately of any errors.
  4. Supply documentation, in the prescribed manner, in support of your application where instructed in the Guide or as part of the application process. Institutions may be unable to consider your application if you fail to follow these instructions.
  5. Pay the required VTAC fees. 



## Participating Institutions 

### Participating institutions have the right to: 

  1. Select applicants according to the course/institutionally based published selection and pre-selection criteria.
  2. Withdraw an offer or cancel a later enrolment if an applicant has not declared full or correct information as part of the application process.
  3. Deny enrolment where an applicant has not accepted their offer at the time and date contained in the offer letter.

  1. All application requirements must be published in the VTAC Guide, website or conveyed to applicants prior to the selection period.
  2. Preference level must not be used as a selection criterion i.e. all applicants must be considered equally, irrespective of where courses are listed on their application. Institutions must not pressure applicants into changing their preferences or prevent them from being involved in a pre-selection requirement on the basis of preference level. 
  3. All offers must be made through VTAC.
  4. Institutions must NOT inform you of an offer before the scheduled date of release of offers.
  5. Institutional contact with you before the first round of offers is prohibited except to advise you: 
    * of interview dates and times
    * of your status regarding pre-selection requirements or for scholarship purposes
    * of changes to the availability of courses
    * for clarification about your details
    * of the VTAC advisory letter process.



Institutions must ensure that your application details are not released to any course authorities, or other third parties, other than the preferred course(s) listed by you.

### VTAC is obliged to:

  1. Provide its services impartially to all applicants and to all participating institutions without bias or favour.
  2. Administer and uphold the agreed system rules and guidelines and to investigate any claimed breaches.
Ensure (together with institutions) that your application details are treated confidentially and supplied only to those course authorities for which application has been made, and only for the purpose of selection.
