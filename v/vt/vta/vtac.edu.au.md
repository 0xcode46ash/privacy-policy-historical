VTAC will only collect information for lawful purposes related to this function or on behalf of VTAC institutions in relation to this function. You may seek access to information about you collected by VTAC, subject to any exception in relevant legislation. 

The type of personal information VTAC collects and holds includes your contact details (name, address, telephone number, email address), date of birth, place of birth, ethnicity, gender, citizenship, languages spoken at home, educational achievements, professional qualifications, employment experience, examination results, Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (ATAR) , and information related to your health or the health of a family member . 

Health information is collected to ensure you receive proper support services to at the time of enrolment or to assess disadvantage as a result of managing health issues. 

The choice to answer health questions is optional (and does not form part of the selection process). 

If you are a current Year 12 student studying the Victorian Certificate of Education (VCE), Victorian Certificate of Applied Language (VCAL) or the International Baccalaureate in Australia, your Year 12 results will be held, along with Year 12 results from other states and territories in Australia, in an archival database at VTAC. If you are eligible for an ATAR or Notional ATAR, these will also be held in the database. Your results, including your ATAR, will be held on similar archives at tertiary admission centres in other states in Australia. Results held on these archives will only be accessed by the relevant tertiary admission centre or member institution if you initiate an application for courses through that centre or if you submit an application for tertiary study directly with an institution participating in that centre. 

If you undertake university studies in Australia and if VTAC has been able to access your results electronically a Grade Point Average (GPA) will be calculated and circulated to institutions to which you have applied. 

If you subsequently initiate a VTAC application for Special Entry Access Schemes or Scholarships the personal information collected from the course application and VTAC registration will be used as outlined in the VTAC privacy policy. 

Supporting documentation sent to VTAC becomes the property of VTAC and may be attached to any application you lodge. If requested supporting information is not provided, it may jeopardise your course application and entitlement for a course offer. 

If you wish to seek access to your personal information or inquire about the handling of your personal and sensitive information, please contact the SEAS Coordinator or the VTAC Privacy Officer.
