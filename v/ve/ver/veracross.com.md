We may collect personally identifiable data, such as: name, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number or other data required to enable us to provide services you may have requested or contracted us to provide, or on behalf of one of our Clients. We also may collect other identifying information from or about you in connection with your use of this website.

You may, however, visit our public website anonymously.

As with many other websites, the Internet servers used to operate this website may collect certain information pertaining to you and the software, equipment and communications method that you use to access the Internet and this website.

This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the website.

Cookies

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.

We use cookies on application websites that we present on behalf of our clients. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use session ID cookies, and do not use persistent cookies.

We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as logging in, will be limited.

3rd Party Cookie

The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/ Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

Technologies such as scripts and tags from service providers are used in various places throughout our site(s) for the purpose of gathering basic analytics information about visitors. Some of this is used by our company for analyzing trends in site use and we may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by those same companies on and individual as well as aggregated basis. The information provided does not identify individual users.

Analytics / Log Files

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically through service providers and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, to gather information about our user base as a whole, and to comply with other security requirements that we adhere to. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

We do not sell, rent or lease customer lists or any of your personally identifiable information to third parties.

If you are a direct Client or prospect we may share data with trusted partners to help perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. For certain sensitive information (e.g., personal information specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, or information pertaining to the sex life of an individual), we must obtain your affirmative consent (opt in) before such information may be disclosed to a third party or used for a purpose other than those for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you through the exercise of an opt in choice. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Veracross, and they are required to maintain at least the same level of privacy protection that we maintain for your information.

Veracross will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process, such as a subpoena, served on us or the site; (b) protect and defend our rights or property; and, (c) act under necessary circumstances to protect the personal safety of users, or the public.

Security of your Personal Information

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards designed to help secure our platform and your personal information and to assist us in preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, loss, alteration and destruction of that information.
