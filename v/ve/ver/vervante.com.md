# Privacy Policy

Vervante is committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process orders and to provide a more personalized shopping experience.

When you order, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date. This allows us to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status.

Vervante uses the latest encryption technology to keep your personal information safe. All your ordering information -- including your name, address, and credit card number -- is encrypted using a secure server for maximum security.

Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.

Vervante does not sell or rent our customers' personal information (including customers' names and shipping, billing, and e-mail addresses) to anyone. Vervante may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i.) comply with law, (ii.) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii.) protect the rights, property, or safety of Vervante, our users, or others.

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information by Vervante. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
