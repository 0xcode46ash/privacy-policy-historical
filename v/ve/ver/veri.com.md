### Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Veritocracy cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your display name or e-mail address is.

The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave cookies activated in order for the Veritocracy web site and login system to function optimally.

Some of our business partners, like our advertisers, may use cookies on our website. We have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

### Information Security and Notification

Your account information on Veritocracy is protected by a password for your privacy and security. Also, Veritocracy will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, nor will we send you e-mails other than to notify you about activity on your account or specific events and system updates regarding the Veritocracy service. However, because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Veritocracy can not guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the site you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the site. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may e-mail you at the address you have supplied for your account.
