### Personal Information.

_Installation_. During and after installation, we may present you with offers to obtain products from our third party partners ("Partners"). You may choose not to accept such offers. Your participation is voluntary, you are not required to receive any products nor disclose to our Partners any information they request. Our products do not collect information that identifies you specifically or could be used to specifically identify, contact or locate you, such as your credit card number ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"), except as otherwise described in this privacy policy. However, we are not responsible if you provide your Personally Identifiable Information to our Partners in response to any offer in which you have expressed interest.

_Voluntary Contact Information_. If you voluntarily submit information or contact us (for example, technical support), we may keep a record of this communication. If you use the customer support section on the Sites, we will collect your email address, topic and any addition information you provide us. We also collect your name and email address on the Sites' "Contact us" forms. We use all of this information for the sole purpose of responding to your inquiry.

### Aggregate Information.

None of the information identifies you personally and we do not link aggregate information to Personally Identifiable Information.

We may create a unique anonymous identifier when you install our products. We use this anonymous identifier to track installations and to enable features and functionality for specific customers who subscribe to our products and services. We do not tie the information gathered by this anonymous identifier to our customers' Personally Identifiable Information.

_Cookies_. A cookie is a small text file sent to your browser. Cookies are stored on your computer's hard drive for record keeping purposes.

Cookies allow our Partners to track visits to their sites and stores. This information collected by cookies is sometimes called "clickstream" or "click trail" and may also describe which pages you have seen. Cookies also measure certain traffic patterns, for example which of our Sites you have visited. We use this information to understand our users' habits so that we can make each new experience on a Site a better one. We may also use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you will see.

Some of the Partner offers on our products may also use cookies. We have no control over our Partners' privacy policies. We also have no control over their cookies, the information collected and its use.

_Web beacons or Pixels_. We and our Partners employ a software technology that helps us better manage content on our site. Web beacons or pixels from us or third parties ("Pixels") are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which track your online Web movement. We may embed Pixels invisibly on Web pages which can be about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by Pixels to our customers' Personally Identifiable Information. With respect to third party Pixels, these third parties may also use anonymous information about your visits to websites in order to improve their products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by third parties, please contact us as indicated below. Some of the Partner Offers may also use Pixels. We have no control over our Partners' Pixels or over how they use information collected.

_Software Information_. We employ a technology that allows us to determine the operating systems you are using and to view your computer's registry. Software installed on your computer has unique registry keys. By viewing your registry, we are able to detect whether you have a compatible operating system, compatible versions of DirectX and Flash Player, and our or our Partners' programs installed. We use your registry information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with software already present on your PC and to avoid duplication of installed programs. We do not tie registry information gathered to our customers' Personally Identifiable Information.

_Hardware Information_. Your computer's operating system also stores hardware information that we examine to determine your computer's hardware configuration, including the amount of memory and the type of video card your computer has, as well as the speed of your processor. We use the information to determine whether our software offers are compatible with your computer hardware. We do not tie hardware information to our customers' Personally Identifiable Information.

_MAC Address_. Your computer's MAC address is a unique code, an alphanumeric identifier, assigned to your computer. We may collect your computer's MAC address when you install our products. We use your computer's MAC address to track unique installations of our products. We do not combine your computer's MAC address with any other information about you.

### Use of Your Information.

Our primary goal is to make our Services more useful to you. By knowing about you, we are able to deliver relevant products and offers. We maintain a secure database of all Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Sites.

_Research_. We study users' demographics and interests using your information. We also use cookies, pixels, software checker information and server log files to better understand and serve you. We compile and analyze this information on an aggregated basis. We also may share this aggregated data periodically with current and potential Partners.

_Third Party Advertising_. Third parties advertise on our Sites, and we also contract with third parties to serve ads across the Internet. These third parties may serve ads about our products or services, or third party products or services which, based on your session data, we or our Partners believe you may be interested in. These third parties may seek to use cookies and pixel tags, including those collected on our Site, to track session data about the ads you have seen and types of things in which you appear interested. These third parties may also use combined information about your visits to our Site and other sites in order to provide advertisements about related goods and services that may be of interest to you. You can opt out of the third party advertising program by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative website <http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp>. Opting out of a network does not mean you will no longer receive online advertising. It does mean that the network from which you opted out will no longer deliver ads tailored to your Web preferences and usage patterns.

When you click on a third party advertiser's link from our Site, you will enter the third party's site. We are not responsible for such third party sites. You should carefully review the privacy statements of any other site you visit, because those privacy statements will apply to your visit to that site, and may be very different from our policy.

### Sharing Your Information.

Partners may sponsor offers or we may co-sponsor an offer with a Partner through the product. You should always assume data collected when you fill in an offer will be shared with a Partner. If an offer requires you to leave our Sites, you should know that our Partners may collect Personally Identifiable Information about you. We do not control these Partner sites. This privacy policy does not cover our partners' websites and information practices. Once you have voluntarily submitted information to our Partners, your Personally Identifiable Information is subject to their privacy policy. We have no liability or responsibility for these privacy policies or the use of any Personally Identifiable Information transferred to Partners. If you no longer wish to be contacted by our partners you must contact that partner directly to opt out.

Our Partners change from time to time, and therefore it is not possible to provide an exhaustive list. We strive to select trustworthy Partners who offer high quality products or services of interest to you. If you are unhappy with one of our Partners, please contact us using our contact information below.

_Our Products_. We do not require you to provide Personally Identifiable Information during our installation process . However, you may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information for Partner offers or when you voluntarily contact us.

_Legal Disclosure_. We may disclose information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our policies or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights, property, users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. We may disclose information, as required by law, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, to comply with a judicial procedure related to our Sites, if the law requires it, or for administrative and other purposes that we deem necessary to maintain service and improve our products and services.

_Sale, Merger or Asset Transfer_. We may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that we or all of our assets are acquired, customer information, including any information collected through the Sites or the products would be one of the transferred assets.

From time to time we use third-parties when providing services to you. We will only share information with third parties necessary for them to provide the services you have requested.
