## Your confidentiality and privacy

We guarantee to protect your privacy. We take great care to make sure you receive the best protection possible for your personal information and any financial details that you provide. The Vertbaudet website is a secure site, and any personal data we collect from you is safe from misuse.

We abide by the Data Protection Act 1998 and we make sure that any personal information we hold is handled properly. This means that your information will be fairly and lawfully processed, that we will make sure that it is accurate, and that your information is not kept for longer than necessary. Your information will be kept secure and processed in line with your rights under the Data Protection Act 1998 and will not be transferred to countries (whether inside or outside of the European Economic Area) without ensuring that adequate protection is in place.

As is normal for any retailer or other organisation, we use reputable businesses from time to time to supply us with a range of services such as delivery of parcels and printing of materials and it may be necessary to share your information, e.g. name/address details for parcel delivery, with those businesses. We will, of course, ensure that your information is secure and adequately protected and processed in line with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## Information we might need from you

Your name, date of birth, address, customer number, telephone number, e-mail address, credit/debit card number, expiry date and issue number. If you enter a prize draw or competition we will need your name, address, customer number and e-mail address.

## How we use this information

#### General Information

  * To confirm receipt of your order, process it and keep you informed of progress
  * To approve, open and run any Credit Account you may have with us and to run any Credit Account you may have with other members of Redcats Group (including payment recovery and debtor tracing)
  * To keep you up to date with new services, facilities, special offers and promotions (further details below)
  * To enhance your shopping experience in the future by tailoring the site to meet your needs
  * To administer prize draws and competitions you may enter



We may also use the information you provide to perform a credit search. Before providing credit, lenders such as banks, loan companies and businesses such as Vertbaudet want to be confident that customers will repay money they lend. To help them do this, they may look at information held by organisations called credit reference agencies. The three main credit reference agencies in the UK are Callcredit, Equifax and Experian. Those agencies hold certain information about most adults in the UK. That information is called your credit reference file or credit report. The agencies get their information from lenders, from information in the public domain (e.g. electoral roll information) and from other sources. Credit reference agencies do not hold credit blacklists and do not tell a lender if it should offer credit - that is for the lender to decide.

  * If you apply for a Credit Account;
  * When managing your existing credit facilities



If we perform a credit search, we will search the files of credit reference agencies who record the search whether or not credit is granted. This search may also include people with whom you are "financially linked" or your "associates". You are financially linked or associated with someone if you have applied for or hold joint credit agreements or accounts with that person. The search will be seen by other lenders who use the information to make credit decisions about you. We will use this information along with credit scoring methods to assess your application and to verify your identity. To prevent or detect fraud or to assist in verifying your identity we may also make searches of the records of other companies in the Redcats Group.

If we enter into a credit agreement with you, we will supply details of that agreement to the credit reference agencies as well as ongoing details of your account and how you manage it. If you do not repay on time or in full we will tell the credit reference agencies who will record details of the debt. All of that information will be seen by other organisations carrying out later searches and may be used by them to make decisions about whether or not to lend to you or those individuals who are financially linked or associated with you. The information may also be used for debt tracing and the prevention of money laundering.

We, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies may also use the records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. We may pass information to financial and other organisations involved in fraud prevention to protect ourselves and our customers from theft and fraud. If you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.

We may use your information held within Redcats Group, including shopping habits, to run your Credit Account if you have one. We may make periodic searches of the records of Redcats Group companies, credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies to manage your account with us, to take decisions regarding credit (including whether to make credit available or to continue or extend existing credit). Those searches will not be available to other lenders for credit assessment purposes. If you require details of the credit reference agencies from whom we obtain and with whom we record information about you please [write to us](https://web.archive.org/contact.htm "contact us") at our Head Office address below or telephone our [Customer Care Team](https://web.archive.org/contact.htm "contact us") on the number given below.

#### Marketing

We may also use your information, including shopping habits, for marketing as set out below. If you do not wish to be contacted for marketing purposes, please see the section below headed “How to unsubscribe from marketing”.
