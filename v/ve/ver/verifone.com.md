**Privacy Policy**  


This document was last updated Sept 18, 2008.

VeriFone, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively "VeriFone" or the "company") are sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. The company believes it is important that you know how it treats the information it receives about you on the Internet.

In general, you can visit VeriFone on the Web without telling the company who you are or revealing any information about yourself. VeriFone's Web servers collect the domain names, not the e-mail addresses, of visitors. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. VeriFone may use this information to measure the content of its Web site and improve its use.

There are times, however, when VeriFone will need information from you such as your name and address. You will be notified at the time of collection how the company will use the information. Usually, the personal information VeriFone collects is used only by the company to respond to your inquiry, process an order or allow you to access specific account information.

VeriFone will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on VeriFone or its Web site, or (b) protect and defend the rights or property of VeriFone and its Web site.

A technology called cookies may be used to provide you with custom information about VeriFone's products or services. A cookie is a tiny element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your hard drive so VeriFone can recognize you upon your return. You may set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie.

At times VeriFone may conduct online surveys to better understand the needs and profile of its visitors. When VeriFone conducts a survey, it will try to let you know how the information will be used at the time of collection.

VeriFone's Web site may contain links to third-party sites. While VeriFone tries to link only to sites that share its high standards and respect for privacy, the company is not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites.

VeriFone will occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of this privacy statement.
