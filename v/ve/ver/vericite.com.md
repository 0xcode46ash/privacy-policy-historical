1.1.3. The Confidentiality Agreement of the VeriCite® Employee Handbook requires all VeriCite® employees to protect Your Confidential Information and Your Covered Content from all unauthorized exposure as part of Our terms of employment.  VeriCite® employees must immediately report any observed, attempted or suspected security incidents to a VeriCite® manager including theft, loss or misplacement of media, computing equipment or devices, unauthorized access or disclosure of information, or notification of malware on a VeriCite® owned and/or managed system.

We will report, either orally or in writing, to You any use or disclosure of Your Confidential Information or Your Covered Content not authorized by this Agreement or in writing by You, including any reasonable belief that an unauthorized individual has accessed Your Confidential Information or Your Covered Content. We will make the report to You immediately upon discovery of the unauthorized disclosure, but in no event more than one (1) business day after We reasonably believe there has been such unauthorized use or disclosure. Our report shall identify: (i) the nature of the unauthorized use or disclosure, (ii) the Confidential Information or Covered Content used or disclosed, (iii) who made the unauthorized use or received the unauthorized disclosure, (iv) what We have done or will do to mitigate any deleterious effect of the unauthorized use or disclosure, and (v) what corrective action We have taken or will take to prevent future similar unauthorized use or disclosure.

In the course of providing services during the term of this Agreement, VeriCite® may have access to student education records that are subject to the US Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g, et seq., to personal information that is subject to protections under the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), or to personal information that falls under the guidelines of the US Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).  All such information is considered confidential and is therefore protected. To the extent that VeriCite® has access to personal information under this Agreement, we are deemed a “school official,” as defined under FERPA, or as an “operator” under COPPA (FAQs Section M1-M5).

We will not provide direct access to such data or information or respond to individual requests.  We will only retrieve such data or information upon receipt of, and in accordance with, written directions by You and shall only provide such data and information to You. It shall be Your sole responsibility to respond to requests for data or information received by Us regarding Your data or information. Should We receive a court order or lawfully issued subpoena seeking the release of such data or information, We will provide immediate notification to You of receipt of such court order or lawfully issued subpoena and will immediately provide You with a copy of such court order or lawfully issued subpoena prior to releasing the requested data or information, if allowed by law or judicial and/or administrative order.

1.1.7. If we experience a security breach concerning any of Your Confidential Information or Your Covered Content, then we will notify You within 24 hours of discovery of the breach and take immediate steps to limit and mitigate such security breach to the extent possible.  We agree to indemnify and hold you harmless for any loss, cost, damage or expense suffered by you, including but not limited to the cost of notification of affected persons, as a direct result of the unauthorized disclosure of education records.
