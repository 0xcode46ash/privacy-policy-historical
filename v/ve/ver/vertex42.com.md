# Vertex42: Terms and Conditions

### Our Online Privacy Policy

This document sets forth the Vertex42, LLC Online Privacy Policy for Vertex42.com (the "Site"). If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Site. 

#### Basic Privacy

Vertex42.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our online visitors. We only collect personal information, such as your name and e-mail address, when it is necessary for processing an online payment, to complete a subscription to one of our newsletters, or register with our forum. We will never sell, trade, or give your personal information to other companies or organizations. (See below for more information about payment processing, newsletters, and forum registration).

#### Payment Processing

Online visitors who wish to purchase a product or membership from our Web site must provide their name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card number and expiration date. However, Vertex42.com does not collect this information. All credit card transactions occur over a secure connection through [ClickBank](http://www.clickbank.com/). In some cases, we use [PayPal](http://paypal.com/) to accept payments. Vertex42.com does not store credit card information. A record of sales, including names and email addresses is maintained in order to provide technical assistance or process refunds. This information is only accessible by members of our staff.

#### Newsletter Subscriptions

Online visitors who ask to be on our mailing lists and/or receive periodic email announcements provide their name and email address. We use a confirmed opt-in subscription process, to prevent a person from subscribing someone without their permission. Anyone who wishes can choose to be removed from our mailing list at any time, by using the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the newsletter(s), or contacting Vertex42.com directly and asking to be removed.

#### Site Usage Statistics

Our server keeps a log of site usage statistics which involves keeping track of numbers of hits on various pages, and the sites from which a visitor is referred. For example, if you find our site through a search engine, our logs will show that a visitor clicked through to our site from that search engine. Such information is used to verify the effectiveness of marketing efforts for our newsletters and products. It may also be used to help interested parties determine the number of visitors who find our site through their sites. In other cases, site statistics are provided to potential advertisers and link partners. _These statistics cannot be used to identify an individual, since they do not include any personal information._

#### Forum Privacy Policy

The forum privacy policy is explained during the registration process, but the registration agreement terms are provided below for reference.

"While the administrators and moderators of this forum will attempt to remove or edit any generally objectionable material as quickly as possible, it is impossible to review every message. Therefore you acknowledge that all posts made to these forums express the views and opinions of the author and not the administrators, moderators or webmaster (except for posts by these people) and hence will not be held liable.

You agree not to post any abusive, obscene, vulgar, slanderous, hateful, threatening, sexually-oriented or any other material that may violate any applicable laws. Doing so may lead to you being immediately and permanently banned (and your service provider being informed). The IP address of all posts is recorded to aid in enforcing these conditions. You agree that the webmaster, administrator and moderators of this forum have the right to remove, edit, move or close any topic at any time should they see fit. As a user you agree to any information you have entered above being stored in a database. While this information will not be disclosed to any third party without your consent the webmaster, administrator and moderators cannot be held responsible for any hacking attempt that may lead to the data being compromised.

This forum system uses cookies to store information on your local computer. These cookies do not contain any of the information you have entered above; they serve only to improve your viewing pleasure. The e-mail address is used only for confirming your registration details and password (and for sending new passwords should you forget your current one)."

#### Childrenâ€™s Privacy

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. Vertex42.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

  * Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
  * Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
  * Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
