# Vertica Privacy Policy | Vertica

  


### Privacy Policy

This privacy policy was last modified on August 1, 2007.

Vertica Systems, Inc. ("Vertica," "we," or "us") knows that you care how information about you is used and shared. This Privacy Policy explains what information of yours will be collected by Vertica when you use vertica.com and related services (the "Service"), how the information will be used, and how you can control the collection, correction and/or deletion of information. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy. 

If you have questions about the Privacy Policy or would like to suggest improvements, please contact us at [privacy@vertica.com](mailto:privacy@vertica.com).

### Information We Collect

**User-Provided Information:** You provide us information about yourself, such as your name and e-mail address, company name and other contact information, when you register with the Service or respond to certain offers on the Service. If you correspond with us by email, we may retain the content of your email messages, your email address and our responses. 

**Cookies Information:** When you visit Vertica.com or other websites we own or operate, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and lets Vertica help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the site. A cookie does not collect personal information about you. Vertica uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser's directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the Service may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

Log File Information: Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page. When you register with or view our site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information.

**Clear Gifs Information:** When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously. No personally identifiable information from your Vertica account is collected using these clear gifs. In addition, we may also use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. The information is used to enable more accurate reporting, improve the effectiveness of our marketing, and make Vertica better for our users.

### How We Use Your Information

We use the personal information you submit to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Service. 

Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose for posting to the Service (for instance, in the User Content you post) becomes available to the public. By providing Vertica your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you Service-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, including changes to features of the Service and special offers. If you do not want to receive such email messages, you may opt out by sending an email message to [info@vertica.com](mailto:info@vertica.com) with the words "No email" in the subject field or by sending mail to the following postal address:

Vertica Systems, Inc.   
Three Dundee Park, Suite 102  
Andover, MA 01810  
Attention: Customer Support Department

Opting out may prevent you from receiving email messages regarding updates, improvements, or offers. You may not opt out of Service-related e-mails. Vertica may use certain information about you and/or your User Content without identifying you as an individual to third parties. We do this for purposes such as analyzing how the Service is used, diagnosing service or technical problems, maintaining security. 

Vertica reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor the User Content you post on the site. Vertica has the right to remove any such information or material for any reason or no reason, including without limitation, if in its sole opinion, such information or material violates, or may violate, any applicable law or our Terms of Use Agreement or to protect or defend its rights or property or those of any third party. Vertica also reserves the right to remove information upon the request of any third party.

We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our service; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors and traffic; (e) diagnose or fix technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; and (f) help you efficiently access your information after you sign in.

### How We Share Your Information

**Personally Identifiable Information:** Vertica will not rent or sell your personally identifiable information to others. Vertica may share your personally identifiable information to third parties solely for the purpose of providing services to you. If we do this, such third parties' use of your information will be bound by this Privacy Policy. We may store personal information in locations outside the direct control of Vertica (for instance, on servers or databases co-located with hosting providers).

As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business offerings. Customer, email, and visitor information is generally one of the transferred business assets in these types of transactions. We may also transfer such information in the course of corporate divestitures, mergers, or dissolution. In any such transfer of information, your user information would remain subject to the promises made in our Privacy Policy.

Except as otherwise described in this privacy statement, Vertica will not disclose personal information to any third party unless required to do so by law or subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to (a) conform to the law, comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, or investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities; (b) to enforce our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/termsofuse), take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our site; and (c) to exercise or protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Vertica, our users or others.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information:** We may share non-personally identifiable information (such as anonymous usage data, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, number of clicks, etc.) with our consultants and interested third parties to help them understand the usage patterns for certain Vertica services. Vertica may also provide links to third-party websites and others. The Vertica privacy policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of, third-party websites. You should consult the privacy policy of any other website you visit from links on the Vertica site.

### How We Protect Your Information

Vertica uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Vertica and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission of information, Vertica makes commercially reasonable efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, please note that this is not a guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. This information includes your User Content. You understand and acknowledge that, even after removal, copies of User Content may remain viewable in cached and archived pages or if other Users have copied or stored your User Content.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you access to your account. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account information, and for controlling access to your email communications from Vertica, at all times.

### Your Choices About Your Information

You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through Vertica, in which case Vertica may not be able to provide certain services to you. You can review and correct the information about you that Vertica keeps on file by contacting us directly at [info@Vertica.com](mailto:info@Vertica.com). 

### Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, Vertica does not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 18 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 18, please do not send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 18 is allowed to provide any personal information to or on Vertica. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 18 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 18, please contact us at [privacy@Vertica.com](mailto:privacy@Vertica.com). 

### Links to Other Web Sites

We are not responsible for the practices employed by Web sites linked to or from our Web site nor the information or content contained therein. Often links to other Web sites are provided solely as pointers to information on topics that may be useful to the users of our Web site. 

Please remember that when you use a link to go from our Web site to another Web site, our Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other Web site, including Web sites which have a link on our Web site, is subject to that Web site's own rules and policies. Please read over those rules and policies before proceeding.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post those changes on our website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it. You are bound by changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the site after those changes have been posted.
