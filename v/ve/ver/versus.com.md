At VERSUS, your privacy is very important to us. VERSUS is committed to contributing to providing a safe and secure Internet environment. The following Privacy Policy applies to all the websites owned and operated by VERSUS, and we ask you to read it thoroughly. Please note that this Privacy Policy does not necessarily reflect our practices with respect to information gathered through off-line means. This Privacy Policy is derived from pledges that we make to you, our users:\- We pledge that we will not provide anyone with personally identifiable information about you without your permission (except as needed to provide to you the services you have expressly requested, as explained in greater detail below).\- We pledge that we will provide mechanisms for you to communicate your privacy questions and concerns to us and that we will respond to them thoughtfully and thoroughly. **Your Consent

Changes are effective when posted to this page and will apply to all information that we have about you.

Anonymous information is information that is not tied to any individual. **Collection and Use of Personally Identifiable Information** **Registration  
** We want to assure you that you can visit our site and use many of our services without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself to us. It is only when you register to become an VERSUS.com member or register for certain VERSUS.com services that you will be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information.Although the majority of our services do not require any form of customer registration, we do require registration for certain services (in which personally identifiable information is furnished; e.g., web stores, eNewsletters, etc.). During this registration process we require you to complete certain fields, offer optional fields for you to complete, and ask you to select a user name and password. For example, we ask for contact information (such as first and last name, email address, state or province and country). VERSUS will use this contact information to:\- Welcome you to the VERSUS.com network.

We may also disclose your personally identifiable information when we believe the law requires it, or in response to any demand by law enforcement authorities or to comply with legal process, such as a court order or subpoena. **Asset Transfers  
** We continue to develop our business and in doing so we might choose to buy other businesses or assets. User information that another company has collected from you may be included in the transferred assets that we acquire in such a purchase. Also, if some or all of our assets are acquired by a third party through a sale or other transaction, user information, including the information collected from you through this Site, may be included in the transferred assets. **Collection and Use of Other Information** **Anonymous Information

Cookies also make web surfing easier for you by saving your preferences while you're on our site. Cookies may also be used by VERSUS.com partners on co-branded Web pages, as explained below in "third party relationships," so please be aware of this as you visit these web pages.You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser.

These partners do not have access to or use your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number or other personally identifiable information.

We will not share or sell linked user behavior and personal user information with any sponsors or third parties unless you have given us authorization to do so.PLEASE NOTE: Under certain circumstances, IP addresses and/or domain names may be linked to personally identifiable information, when said information is stored in databases managed by Internet registrars or registries such as Network Solutions. **Third Party Relationships

You should make every effort to read the privacy policies provided by or in association with such third parties, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to continue utilizing the services based upon the privacy policies posted on these co-branded web pages, at your own discretion.
