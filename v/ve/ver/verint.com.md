  * Name
  * Postal address (including billing and shipping addresses)
  * Telephone number
  * Email address
  * Organization and job title or function
  * Login ID, PIN or other Password for access to certain content on the Site



We may merge Personal Information collected through the Site with Personal Information that we collect about you offline, such as business contact information that we receive in connection with sales presentations, your e-mails to us or your purchases from us, information gathered when you attend a trade show, seminar or other business event, or information provided by your employer if your company enrolls you in a training event.  All such merged Personal Information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We use third-party payment services (" **Payment Service** ") to collect payments for purchases made through the Site.  If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Verint.  Any Personal Information that you provide through the Payment Service’s webpage will be collected by Payment Service and not by us, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SUCH PAYMENT SERVICES. ** **
