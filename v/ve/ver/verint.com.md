# Privacy Policy : Legal : About Verint : Verint

Last revised: December 22, 2009

Verint Systems Inc. and its [subsidiaries](http://verint.com/corporate/section2a.cfm?article_level2_category_id=15&article_level2a_id=211) (collectively, " **Verint** ," " **we** , " **us** ") share your concerns about the protection of your personal information online.  This Privacy Policy (the " **Policy** ") describes our practices regarding the collection and use of information through our websites, including our partner and customer extranets, where this Policy is posted (collectively, the " **Site** ").  By providing personal information to us, you signify your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not provide us with any personal information.

In some cases, specific Verint websites may contain other notices about their collection, use and disclosure of information. To the extent that those notices conflict with this Policy, website specific policy will control. 

Please note that Verint reviews its privacy practices from time to time, and that those practices are subject to change. We ask that you bookmark and periodically review this page to ensure continuing familiarity with the most current version of our Privacy Policy. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by checking the "Last revised" legend at the top of the Policy.  Any changes to our Policy will become effective upon our posting of the revised Policy on the Site. Use of the Site following such changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy then in effect. 

**The Information We Gather.**

Verint gathers three types of information: 

**(1) Personal information:**  Personal information is information that identifies a person as an individual.  You do not have to provide personal information to us; however; particular services made available through the Site may require us to collect personal information from you. We collect personal information from you, such as, your first name, surname, street address, email address and telephone number, as well as your business contact information, and, if applicable, your credit card information or other payment information. This information is collected when registering for services, when submitting an inquiry or request form to us through the Site, when logging a ticket for maintenance and/or services or when registering to use and post on forums or blogs we may provide.  

Verint may merge personal information collected about you offline, such as business contact information that we receive in connection with sales presentations, information regarding purchase history or information gathered when you attend a trade shows, seminar or other business events, with personal information about you that we collect through the Site and that is stored in our databases. If we do merge offline personal information with personal information about you that we collect through the Site, all such personal information shall be treated in accordance with this Policy.

In some cases, you may provide us with personal information about another person, such as of a colleague, partner or customer. By providing us with personal information about another person, you represent that you have obtained the consent of the person whose personal information you are providing to us. 

**(2) Non-personal information:**  Non-personal information is aggregated information, demographic information, and any other information that does not reveal a person’s specific identity. When visitors come to our Site, we and our service providers collect and aggregate information indicating, among other things, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which they were visited and which hyperlinks were "clicked".  Collecting such information involves the logging of the operating system and browser software used by each visitor to the Site.

We may also collect non-personal information when you voluntarily provide it to us, such as information concerning your business or areas of interest. Also, when we collect personal information from you in a transaction, inquiry, request or visit, we may extract some non-personal information about that event and combine it with other non-personal information such as clickstream data. This information is used to help us understand trends and patterns. Such information constitutes non-personal information because, unless combined with personal information, it does not personally identify you or any other user. 

We also use "cookies" to help us determine, for example, the type of content and sites to which a visitor to the Site links, the length of time each visitor spends at any particular area of the Site and the Verint services visitors choose to use. A cookie is a piece of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored by your browser on your computer and may identify, for example, your preferences. Cookies allow Verint to serve you better and more efficiently, and to personalize your experience at the Site.  The Site may also use web beacons, pixel tags, clear GIFs or other technologies to better tailor the Site to provide better customer service. These technologies often work in conjunction with cookies. Nevertheless, you should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser.  If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a procedure in most browsers that allows you to decline the use of cookies. For more information on how to do so, please refer to the documentation accompanying your browser. To learn more about cookies, please visit [http://www.allaboutcookies.org/](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

**(3)  IP addresses:** Your IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever users visit the Site, along with the time(s) of such visit(s) and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. It may be possible to determine from an IP address a visitor’s ISP and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.  

**How We Use and Disclose Information We Gather.**

Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways Verint uses the information that it gathers. 

**(1) Personal information:**

_Transactions_

. Verint may use and disclose your personal information to fulfill your requests and complete transactions with you. If you request something through the Site, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use your personal information to fulfill your request.  To help us do this, we may share information, with others, for instance, our affiliates, business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, postal or government authorities (for example, Customs authorities) involved in fulfillment of such transactions.  

_Purchases_

. If you choose to make a purchase from us, we may use your personal information and we may share your personal information with our third party service providers to complete your purchase, including, without limitation, to process your credit card or other payment information.

_Surveys_

. We may contact you to request that you complete a customer satisfaction survey or for market research purposes. If you do not wish to receive surveys or be contacted for market research purposes, you may opt-out of receiving future requests by following the opt-out instructions in the applicable communication or by opting-out out as indicated below in the “Opt-Out” section. 

_Marketing_

. Verint may use your personal information to send informational and promotional materials to you.  Our electronic marketing communications provide the customer with a method of "opting out" of receiving future electronic marketing communications of a similar nature. You may also opt-out from receiving electronic marketing communications as set forth in the “Opt-Out” section below.

_Correspondence_

. If you contact us by email, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and reserve the right to use your email address, and any information you provide in your message, to respond. In addition, from time to time we may email important information regarding the use of the Site or services, or other administrative information, to people who have provided us with their email addresses. Because this information may be important, it is not possible to "opt out" of receiving these emails. 

_Messages to Friends_

.  We may provide functionality to permit you to send messages regarding Site-related content to a friend through the Site. If you wish to use this feature, we will use your friend’s name and e-mail address so that we can facilitate your sending of the message to your friend. Please note that any personal information you provide in connection with the sending of this message to your friend, such as your name and your e-mail address, will, of course, be disclosed to your friend.

_Social Media Channels_

. Verint may provide social, business and communication channels (such as forums, wikis, blogs and other social media platforms and interactive services) to which you are able to post information and materials (collectively, “ **BCC Services** ”) on or through the Site to enable online sharing and collaboration. Please note that any information you disclose through the BCC Services becomes public information, and may be available to visitors to the Site and to the general public. In addition, when you choose to make a posting on the BCC Services, certain personal information (which may include, for example, your user name), may be available for other users to view. We urge you to exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose personal information, or any other information, on or through the BCC Services. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THROUGH THE BCC SERVICES. 

_Business Partners_

. If you represent a Verint business partner, we may use personal information you provide (including any personal information you provide when you visit one of our extranets intended specifically for Verint business partners) to administer and develop our business relationship with you and the business partner you represent. For example, as part of our lead generation activities, we may share your personal information with our customers so that they can contact you regarding your services (or regarding any integrated services/solutions we may offer) or with other business partners so that they can contact you regarding a potential reseller relationship. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY OUR CUSTOMERS OR OTHER BUSINESS PARTNERS.

_Customers_

. If you represent a Verint customer, we may use personal information you provide (including any personal information you provide when you visit one of our extranets intended specifically for Verint customers) to administer and develop our business relationship with you and the Verint customer you represent. Further, if you choose to purchase products and services from us and our business partners (or products and services from us that include or require products and services of our business partners), we may share your personal information with the applicable business partners who will provide the applicable products and services, such as integration services. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SUCH BUSINESS PARTNERS.

_Internal Business Purposes._

 We may also use your personal information for our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. For example, our service providers create reports on Site usage, which contain information on Site usage on a personally identifiable basis, and we use these reports for our internal business purposes.

_Service Providers_

. Verint works with third parties who provide services that may include, but are not necessarily limited to, website hosting, data analysis and email services. We reserve the right to share personal information with third party service providers for the purpose of providing services, and will seek to impose confidentiality obligations on service providers. 

_Third Party Communications_

. From time to time, we may share your personal information with third parties to allow them to contact you regarding products, programs, services and promotions that they believe may be of interest to you. If you would prefer that we do not share your information with third parties for the third parties’ marketing purposes, please see the "Opt-Out" section below.

_Assignment_

. We reserve the right to transfer any and all information that we collect to an affiliate or a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including without limitation in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

_Law enforcement; Emergencies; Compliance_

. We reserve the right to use and release personal information if we believe that a person is in violation of our [Terms of Service](http://verint.com/corporate/section2a.cfm?article_level2_category_id=3&article_level2a_id=205) or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any illegal activity, and to use and release such information in response to court and governmental orders (including court and government orders outside your country of residence), civil subpoenas, discovery requests and as otherwise required or permitted by law (including laws outside your country of residence).  We also reserve the right to use and release personal information when we believe that such use and/or release is needed to protect the rights, property, safety or security of Verint, our visitors, customers or the public, to respond to an emergency or to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. 

**(2) Non-personal information:** Verint and its service providers use non-personal information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful online services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our Site visitors, and by measuring demographics and interests, for example, regarding specific areas of the Site. Verint and its service providers may also use non-personal information to analyze trends and statistics and to help us provide better customer service.  We may provide statistical information based on this data to our affiliates and other current and potential business partners of Verint. We may also use the aggregate data to inform third parties as to the number of people who have seen and clicked on links to their websites.  Because non-personal information does not personally identify you, we may use this information for any purpose. In addition, we reserve the right to share non-personal information, which does not personally identify you, with our affiliates and other third parties, for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personal information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we do combine any non-personal information with personal information, the combined information will be treated by us as personal information hereunder as long as it is combined. 

**(3)  IP addresses: **We use IP addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site. We may also use and disclose IP addresses for all the purposes for which we use and disclose personal information. Please note that we treat IP addresses, server log files and related information as non-personal information, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law.

**Third Party Sites.**

The Site contains links to other Internet web sites (including, for example, to Verint’s presence on Facebook or Twitter), as well as to co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by Verint.  Unless otherwise explicitly stated, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any such web sites, including such sites’ use of any information (such as IP address, browser type or operating system) collected when visitors to the Site click through links to those sites.  We provide these links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us. If you provide any personal information through any third party website, your transaction will occur on the third party website (not the Site) and the personal information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. We recommend that you familiarize yourself with the privacy policies and practices of any third parties. PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS POLICY DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY OR INFORMATION PRACTICES OF ANY THIRD PARTIES.
