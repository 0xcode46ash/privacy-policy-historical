What information does the Web site gather?

Please be assured that we do not collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us. This means that you can visit our Web sites without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself (such as your e-mail address, software you are using, or any information about yourself). 

As you browse the site, our web servers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs, we monitor statistics such as: 

  * How many people visit our site
  * Which pages people visit on our site
  * From which domains our visitors come (e.g., aol.com) 
  * Which browsers people use to visit our site



None of this information is associated with you as an individual (see information about cookies below). We use these statistics to improve our Web site, to monitor its performance, and to make the Web site easier for you and other visitors to use.   
  
What about pages that asks for personal information?

When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, we use the information for that purpose (such as to provide the service or information the visitor has requested). 

For example, you may be asked to give us individual information to purchase a product or service, receive information, manage online account registration, or apply for a job. The information may range from your zip code, to your phone number, account number, a credit card number, age, gender, motherÂ´s maiden name, social security number, e-mail address, organization URL, resume, or mailing address. 

When visitors use our Web site to order services, we may use this individually-identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have requested a non-published number), or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. At this time this information is not shared between divisions at Verizon Wireless. If you do not want us to contact you, you can remove your name from our telephone or mail solicitation lists. 

If you provide individual information to us in the context of an event we sponsor with another company, such as a contest, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information, and you can decide whether or not to participate. Otherwise, we do not share your personal information with any third parties.   
  
What happens to information when I fill out registration forms?

We encourage all visitors to register with us, although registration is only required for access to online billing or local account management. The registration forms request accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your preferences at any time, or remove your name entirely from our user list. 

For our local phone service customers, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with us (limited to specific areas). This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. You may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online. 

We strive to ensure that the information we obtain and use about customers is accurate. Please notify us to review or modify any personal information we have previously collected from you or if you find an error in your bill. Customers have access to their account information via our monthly bills or by establishing an account online. To improve the services we can offer you, we may decide to expand the site's capabilities for obtaining information about users in the future. We will update this privacy statement continually to ensure that you are aware of developments in this area.   
  
Does this site send e-mail to site visitors?

At times, online surveys are conducted in which you can choose to participate. Also, information is gathered in our Contact Us section to help us respond to your inquiry. 

We may use e-mail to communicate with our customers, to respond to visitors' e-mail, to confirm orders placed online, and to send information that a visitor has requested. Occasionally, we may use opt-in e-mail lists from third parties to promote our latest specials. If you receive an unwanted e-mail from us, you can use the Reply feature on your browser and simply ask us to remove you from our list.   
  
Does this site use third party ad servers?

We limit the use of third party ad servers to occasional, anonymous tracking of specific pages on our site. This is done only to track the effectiveness of individual banner campaigns. We do NOT collect or share any personal information with ad servers.   
  
What are cookies and why do you use them?

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique User ID for our Web site. We use cookies to deliver web content specific to your interests, to keep track of your order as you order services, and to control access to our premium content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique VerizonWireless.com User ID.

Do you accommodate links to other sites?

This Web site contains links to other Web sites. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites. 

We are committed to safeguarding customer privacy on all our Web sites. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well. You can feel confident that your individually-identifiable information will be protected when you access your account or order services from us over the Internet.

What security measures are in place to restrict access to personal data?

There are a variety of security measures in place that limits internal access to data stored by the Verizon Wireless site.
