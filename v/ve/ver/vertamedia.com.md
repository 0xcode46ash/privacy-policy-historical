Opt-Out Procedure for mobile internet-based or mobile device advertising

Some of our partners may collect information on mobile internet based sites or mobile devices. Should you wish to opt-out of this type of targeting on both Android and/or IOS platforms please click on the below links:

Android

[https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html#get_started ](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/id.html#get_started)

Text from the Android Developers Guide is below.

The advertising ID is a unique but user-resettable string identifier that lets ad networks and other apps anonymously identify a user. The user’s advertising ID is made available to apps through APIs provided in Google Play services.

Users can reset their advertising ID at any time, right from the Ads section of the Google Settings app on their devices. From the same app, users can also opt-out of targeted advertising based on the advertising ID by setting the appropriate ad tracking preference. When the user opts-out of targeted ads, this ad tracking preference is made available to apps through a Google Play services API.

Apps making use of the advertising ID must check for and respect the user’s ad tracking preference. Also please note that any use of the advertising ID must abide by the terms of the Google Play Developer Content Policies.

IOS

Text from Apple’s US privacy policy is below.

Apple and its partners use cookies and other technologies in mobile advertising services to control the number of times you see a given ad, deliver ads that relate to your interests, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. If you do not want to receive ads with this level of relevance on your mobile device, you can opt out by accessing the following link on your device: [http://oo.apple.com](http://oo.apple.com/). Alternatively, if you are using iOS 6 or above operating system on your mobile device, you may opt-out by electing Limit Ad Tracking (Learn More). If you opt out, you will continue to receive the same number of mobile ads, but they may be less relevant because they will not be based on your interests. You may still see ads related to the content on a web page or in an application or based on other non-personal information. Opting out through oo.apple.com applies only to Apple advertising services and does not affect interest-based advertising from other advertising networks. However, if you select Limit Ad Tracking on your mobile device, third party apps are not permitted by contract to use the Advertising Identifier, a non-personal device identifier to serve you targeted ads.
