# verabradley.com - Vera Bradley - Privacy Policy

Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. Vera Bradley values our consumers' privacy and has made it our policy to provide online content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personal information may be requested. Vera Bradley reserves the right to change, modify, add to or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. 

Below are some of the ways in which a visitor may provide information to us online and how we may use that information. 

Information Actively Provided by Our Visitors

Vera Bradley only collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, address, email address, phone number, birth date, and occupation. Unless specifically stated, we do not require this information to obtain access to our site. The personal information we collect is used by Vera Bradley only for the specific purpose for which it is submitted, as indicated below and on our website. For example:

**Customer Service**  
On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. We also collect personal information when you send us emails containing questions or requests. We do not save any personal information associated with comments. We only save personal information associated with questions and requests in our customer service database (data which does not expire and is retained) in order to respond to those questions and requests, and to better serve you when responding to any questions or requests you may have in the future.

**Catalog Requests**  
The names and mailing addresses submitted by visitors who request a printed catalog are used only to mail the catalog and are not shared, unless you have given us permission to do so, for example, by checking the box allowing us to share your information with your Favorite Store, or by checking the box allowing us to share your information with our marketing partners. If you would like to remove your name and address from our catalog mailing list, please send an email to [customercare@verabradley.com](mailto:customercare@verabradley.com). Please include your full name, email address and phone number in case we have questions.

**Club Vera Profile**  
The Club Vera member service collects some personal information in order to save preferences and Wish List information. This information is retained to provide you with the ability to track products you have purchased or received as gifts. On occasion, we may use this information to offer products or information that we think may be of interest to our customers (most of our customers enjoy receiving such material). 

The Club Vera member service also allows you to register for emails reminding you of new products or special promotions. In addition, if you have made a purchase and register it with Club Vera, we may send you content-specific newsletters or special information about other Vera Bradley products via email in the future. 

On occasion, we also may send information or offers to Club Vera members on behalf of other companies or organizations, such as the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer.
