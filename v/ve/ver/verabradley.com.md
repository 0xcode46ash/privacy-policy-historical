To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make links available to it on our homepage and at points where personal information may be requested. Vera Bradley reserves the right to change, modify, add to or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes.

#### Information Collected

**Personal Information**  
Vera Bradley collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. We may request personal information about you in connection with your use of, or participation in, our website, including through discussion/social networking forums, registrations, store purchases, content submissions, contests, sweepstakes, promotions and requests for additional information or suggestions, or in connection with other services or resources provided on the site. Personal information may include name, address, email address, phone number, birth date, occupation, credit card account data and other purchasing information. You may also provide us with photographs or other video/media content which may contain personal information. Unless specifically stated, we do not require this information to obtain access to our site. The personal information we collect is used by Vera Bradley only for the specific purpose for which it is submitted. For example:

  * **Customer Service:** On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. We also collect personal information when you send us emails containing questions or requests. We only save personal information associated with questions and requests in our customer service database (unless otherwise stated herein, data which does not expire and is retained) in order to respond to those questions and requests, and to better serve you when responding to any questions or requests you may have in the future.

  * **Catalog Requests:** The names and mailing addresses submitted by visitors who request a printed catalog are used to mail the catalog and may also be shared with your Favorite Store, or with our marketing partners to provide you with additional information or products we think may be of interest to you. If you would like to remove your name and address from our catalog mailing list, please send an email to [customercare@verabradley.com](mailto:customercare@verabradley.com). Please include your full name, email address and phone number in case we have questions.

On occasion, we may use this information to offer products or information that we think may be of interest to our customers (most of our customers enjoy receiving such material).

The Club Vera member service also allows you to register for emails reminding you of new products or special promotions. In addition, if you have made a purchase and register it with Club Vera, we may send you content-specific newsletters or special information about other Vera Bradley products via email in the future. On occasion, we also may send information or offers to Club Vera members on behalf of other companies or organizations, such as Vera Bradley Retail Stores or the Vera Bradley Foundation for Breast Cancer.

It may take several days to process your instructions, and you may receive messages after submitting your instructions.

**Non-personal Information**  
Vera Bradley collects a variety of non-personal information from visitors to our website. This data is not personally identifiable and is collected automatically via the use of cookies (small computer files saved on your hard drive) and other standard web technology. Automatically-collected information may include: the operating system on your computer, the type of web browser you are using, your IP address, and the links you followed to enter and leave the site.

Vera Bradley's web servers collect the domain names of visitors to our website, however, they do not recognize individual email addresses. Aggregate information showing the IP addresses and/or domain names of visitors, the number of visits, average time spent on the website, pages viewed, etc. is collected and used only for internal review to measure the overall use of our website and provide direction for its continuous improvement. This information is not sold to or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.

**Privacy of Children**  
Vera Bradley provides additional privacy protections when children visit the website. We do not knowingly collect, maintain or store personal information from or about children under the age of 13 without a parent's and/or legal guardian's consent, except in limited circumstances authorized by law and described in this notice. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 18, PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY WITH A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN. IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 13, YOU SHOULD GET YOUR PARENT'S OR LEGAL GUARDIAN'S PERMISSION BEFORE GIVING OUT ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION.

Vera Bradley does not require disclosure of personal information on our websites. A child can visit our sites or certain sections of our sites directed to children without ever registering or providing personally identifiable information. However, our sites may contain special features, forums and clubs requiring registration. For example, special features open to children may require registration by a parent or legal guardian. Details on the information we require to register, as well as any rules or restrictions, are available at the designated registration areas. Only visitors who are 18 or older may purchase products from our online stores.

We offer our child visitors opportunities to share their ideas and interests through online forums and other content features. We may also ask a child to voluntarily provide a first name, age, birth date and state when submitting a response to one of our site features or promotions. We will not ask a child for more information than is reasonably necessary for the child to participate in the activity. We may even use a stage or screen name before any responses are posted to our website. We will also obtain parental consent before using photographs of children or knowingly accepting online registrations of children.

We do not collect personal information from children under the age of 13 without their parent's/legal guardian's consent except in special, limited circumstances:

  * If we offer an e-mail newsletter or similar feature, we will ask for the child's e-mail address and first name, and also ask for a parent's/legal guardian's e-mail address for purposes of opting out/unsubscribing.
  * For promotions, contests and other similar activities, Vera Bradley will not ask for more information than is necessary for the child to participate in the activity. If your child participates in the promotion or contest activity, we will notify you and generally ask that you provide the information instead of your child. Any information that you (or your child) submits to Vera Bradley will be deleted from our database after (i) the promotion or contest is concluded; and (ii) any legally required period for retaining the data is complete.



Parents/legal guardians may review personal information we have collected about their child, request deletion, or refuse to allow further collection or use of the information by emailing Customer Service at [customercare@verabradley.com](mailto:customercare@verabradley.com).

At times, we employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf.
