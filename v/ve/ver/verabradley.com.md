**Privacy Statement**  


  
Welcome to Vera Bradley's website! We are proud to have this opportunity to tell you a little about our company, our products and our history. Before you begin exploring, we'd like to review the steps we have taken to ensure that our visitors have a safe, enjoyable experience.

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. Vera Bradley values our consumers' privacy and have made it our policy to provide online content that requires minimal collection of information from our visitors. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personal information may be requested. Vera Bradley reserves the right to change, modify, add to or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for any changes. 

  
Below are some of the ways in which a visitor may provide information to us online and how we may use that information.

**Domain Name Recognition**

Vera Bradley's web servers collect the domain names of visitors to our website, however, they do not recognize individual email addresses. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, etc. Vera Bradley uses this information to measure the overall use of our site and provide direction for its continuous improvement.

**Information Actively Provided by Our Visitors**

Vera Bradley only collects personal information from our visitors on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, address, email address, phone number, etc. Unless specifically stated, we do not require this information to obtain access to our site. The personal information we collect is used by Vera Bradley only for the specific purpose for which it is submitted, as indicated on our website. For example:

>   
>  Frequent Questions
> 
> On some pages our visitors can submit comments or ask questions. The only personal information that we collect is the sender’s email address. We do not save any personal information associated with comments, and we only save email addresses associated with questions in order to respond to those questions. 
> 
> Catalog Requests
> 
> The names and mailing addresses submitted by visitors who request a printed catalog are used only to mail the catalog, unless otherwise stated. Mailing addresses are not used for other marketing purposes unless specifically stated and are not sold to third-party sources. 
> 
> Email Newsletters
> 
> Some of our pages allow visitors to register to receive periodic email newsletters or updates from us by providing an email address. Any email you receive from Vera Bradley will allow you to "unsubscribe" from this informational service at any time. 
> 
> Club Vera Profile
> 
> The Club Vera member service collects some personal information in order to save preferences and wish list information. This information is also retained to provide you with the ability to track products you have purchased or received as gifts. On occasion, we may use this information to offer products or information that we think may be of interest to our customers (most of our customers enjoy receiving such material). If you prefer not to receive this information, please mail us at the address below and we will remove your name from our database. The Club Vera member service also allows you to register for emails reminding you of new products or special promotions. In addition, if you have made a purchase and register it with Club Vera, we may send you content-specific newsletters or special information about other Vera Bradley products via email in the future.
> 
> Email a Friend
> 
> There are some features on our website that may require visitors to enter another person's personal information and/or email address in order to use the feature. We only use this information to allow visitors to share certain website content with friends, and delete the information within a reasonable period of time after it is no longer needed. 

**Aggregate Information**

Aggregate information showing the pages visitors access during a session (for example, to enter a visitor in a contest or to send the visitor information) is only used for internal review as we continue to improve our website. This information is not sold to or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We do not rent, sell, or share email addresses with any other company or organization.

Finally, we never use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

Vera Bradley utilizes appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to guard our online visitors' personal information against unauthorized access and use. All information is protected by Vera Bradley's security measures, which are periodically reviewed.
