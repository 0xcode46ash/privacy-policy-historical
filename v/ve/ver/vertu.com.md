    * To respond to your requests
    * For security purposes, to help identify you when you telephone us – for example, by asking you for your date of birth or telephone number so that we can avoid disclosing information to a person who is not authorized by you to receive it;

If you place an order for a product, request a service or submit content to this Site, we may need to contact you for additional information required to process or fulfill your order and/or request. However, unless compelled by applicable legislation, we will not provide this information to a third party without your permission, except as necessary to process your order, fulfill your requests or manage VERTU Concierge.

  4. Disclosure of Information
    We will not disclose your personal information to anyone other than VERTU companies and other entities who need to know in order to provide support services, benefits, and supply of products and services to you without your consent. Where required or permitted by law, information may be provided to others, such as government authorities. We will not sell mailing lists to third parties for their marketing purposes.
    Where your personal information is disclosed to third parties to enable them to provide services for or on behalf of, or at the direction of, VERTU or VERTU companies VERTU will take measures to ensure that such third parties comply with VERTU's privacy policy and that such recipients (i) do not use your personal information other than for the purposes permitted; (ii) obtain and process your personal information only on condition that they secure that personal information from an authorised use and adopt and comply with similarly stringent policies and terms on personal information protection and use; and (iii) comply strictly with applicable laws.
    Where you provide personal information in connection with transactions connected with this Site involving payments, VERTU may transmit your personal information to third parties who are credit/fraud probability assessment agencies or third parties who are otherwise involved in crime prevention, in order to process the acceptability of your tendered credit card or other payment methods or to combat crime, and/or to credit card and other payment processing agencies. Any personal information transmitted to those third parties may need to be transferred to the United States of America or other places outside the European Economic Area, for processing and related purposes. Some agencies have advised that transmitted personal information will also be used to generate credit, risk or fraud possibility assessments for VERTU and other third parties with whom you may enter into transactions.
  5. Security
    Please note that while there are always risks associated with providing personal data, whether in person, by phone or over the Internet, and no system of technology is completely safe, "tamper" or "hacker- proof", VERTU has endeavoured to take appropriate measures to prevent and minimize risks of unauthorized access to, improper use and the inaccuracy of your personal information. For example, we use encryption technology when collecting or transferring sensitive data such as credit card information.
