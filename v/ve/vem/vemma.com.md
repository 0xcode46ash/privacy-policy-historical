PRIVACY POLICY
The protection of personal information is crucial with the Vemma Nutrition Company
(“Vemma”). Privacy protection is, and always will be, critical to our business. Vemma will
maintain strict customer information confidentiality policies. Vemma has formulated policies that
give its Independent Members and Customers a very high level of protection of personally
identifiable information. Vemma provides the following privacy protections:
Vemma’s purposes for collection of personal information may include billing (for purchase of
product or services, where applicable), provision of customer service, network management,
customer surveys, provision of offers of related services and other exchanges of information.
Vemma will not disclose or share personally identifiable information collected via the Internet or
telephone with any other companies or organizations without the informed consent of the
consumer providing the information (except as required by law).
Vemma will use information received via email or regular mail from customers and other
individuals only for purposes reasonably related to the subject matter of communication.
Vemma does not target children for collection of personal information at any of its websites.
Vemma recognizes that the privacy of children must be protected. We believe that parents
have the right to protect the privacy and security of their children and to prevent the
inappropriate use of information about their children. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy,
“children” are defined in the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.
As technologies continue to enhance and expand the collection of information of all kinds, we
will apply our technological and marketplace expertise in efforts to ensure that our Independent
Members, Customers and Users receive the kind of privacy protection that will make them
confident and secure. We are not responsible, however, for use of personal information that is
obtained independently by third parties as a result of your use of the Internet.
Consistent with these policies, Vemma prohibits the collection, distribution or gathering of
personal or aggregate information, including Internet or email addresses, about Vemma’s
Independent Members or any of Vemma’s other users.
