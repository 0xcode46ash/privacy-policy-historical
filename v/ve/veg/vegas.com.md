**Privacy Policy**

Vegas.com takes the privacy of our readers very seriously. On this page, we have tried to address some of the main privacy concerns that you might have. If you have additional questions that are not answered here, please write us at this address: [webmaster@vegas.com](mailto:webmaster@vegas.com).

This demographic information is collected from voluntary surveystaken by visitors to Vegas.com or affiliate sites. We only share individual information regarding your profile **when you have authorized us to do so,** via a checkbox labeled "Vegas.com may make the information that I supplied available to selected companies so that they may contact me regarding products or services that may be of interest to me." Again -- we will only share your information when you have given us permission to do so.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers online may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding orders they have placed online.

 **What about cookies?**

The U.S. Department of Energy's Computer Incident Advisory Capabilityhas issued an information bulletin stating that privacy advocates'fears over the use of cookies -- a popular technique for trackingWeb site visitors -- are unfounded. The claims that Web cookiesmay be used to gather information on "passwords, credit card numbers,and a list of the software on your computer" is not even "closeto the truth," according to the bulletin. In fact, information thatis gathered via cookies -- usually a user's numerical Internet address,browser type and operating system -- can also be recorded in a Webserver's log files. "Cookies just make it easier. [A server] cannotfind out your name or e-mail address, or anything about your computerusing cookies," says the bulletin.
