**Information collected and how it is used**  
Veggies Unite! will use reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure or use of your personal information. We will not sell, share, or rent your information in any way different from what is disclosed in this statement. Veggies Unite! collects information from you at several different points on our website. This information is used to enhance your experience on Veggies Unite! and as described below. 

TOP

**We collect information in the following areas:**

**I. Membership**   
Veggies Unite! does not collect your personal identifiable information unless you provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we don't require you to sign up as a member or provide personally identifiable information to us in order to view our site. However, you must become a member if you wish to use certain features on our site. 

In order to sign up for the following features you must first complete an online membership form. 

  * Recipe, Article, and Book Comments
  * Discussion Boards
  * Grocery List and Meal Planner
  * Contests and Promotions
  * Membership Bios

During membership registration you are required to give contact information (such as your name and email address). This information is used to provide the services that you have requested, or to contact you about the service on our site for which you have expressed interest. We may contact you from time to time with news. 

**Security & Safety**  
To take the worry out of using your credit card to pay the voluntary membership dues, we use PayPal and Amazon.com Honor System. They have Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts your credit card information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it impossible for another party to intercept your personal information. 

You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock icon at the bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just 'surfing.' 

**Contests and Promotions**  
You must be a member in order to enter contests and promotions on Veggies Unite!. Participation in these events is completely voluntary and we do not require you to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as your name and shipping address) and demographic information. Your contact information will be used to notify you if you've won and to award prizes. 

**II. Recipe Submission**  
Your personally identifying information may be used for editorial purposes (such as attributing your submitted recipe to you). We may also use this information to contact you should we have any complications with your recipe. 

**III. E-Recipes ("E-mail this recipe to a friend" link)**  
When you elect to use our referral service for emailing a recipe to a friend, we ask you for your friend's name and email address and your name and email addres. We will automatically send your friend the recipe and a link back to Veggies Unite!. We do not store you or your friend's contact information. 

**IV. Veggies Unite! Newsletter and Weekly Recipe List**  
We use the services provided by www.yourmailinglistprovider.com to maintain our mailing lists and to send out messages to our mailing lists. When you subscribe to one of our newsletters, it is through them. They may ask for contact information such as your name and email address. They guarantee that email addresses that are collected via their website are not sold or passed to third parties. 

When you sign up for one of our mailing lists hosted by YourMailinglistProvider, a welcome page located on their server is shown. They generate revenues with the banner displayed on this page.

**V. Cookies**   
Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the "cookie" contains only your membership username and encrypted password. The "cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We use the "cookie" to allow you access to use the features on our site which require membership.

If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing the features of our site which require membership.

Some of our business partners also use cookies on our site. See [Third Party Advertising](https://web.archive.org/misc/privacy.shtml#third)

**VI. Log Files and IP addresses**  
Each time a Veggies Unite! page is requested from your browser, we log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP address to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. When you use the Discussion Boards, we encrypt your IP address and include it in your post. This is to help prevent spam. Occasionally, we may have to include your unencrypted IP address in your post.

**VII. Polls and Surveys**  
From time to time our site requests information from you via polls and surveys. This information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Polls and surveys may also be used to determine how you and other users of Veggies Unite! feel about various issues. Participation is completely at your discretion.

**Third Party Advertising**  
We use Linkshare and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads and to provide broad demographic information for better advertisement targeting. Privacy issues surrounding Linkshare's use of certain non-personally identifiable user information by its technology are discussed in Linkshare's privacy policy, and are the sole responsibility of Linkshare. That policy can be viewed on Linkshare's [Privacy Policy page](http://www.linkshare.com/privacy.html). 

TOP

**Other Sites**   
From time to time we may have links to other websites from our site. We do not control, and therefore cannot be responsible for, the collection, use or disclosure of your information by any such third party site. Please carefully review the privacy policy of any third party site that you go to from our site.
