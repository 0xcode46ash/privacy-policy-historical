# VeggieTales.com: Privacy Policy

VeggieTales.com welcomes visitors who want to know more about our products. And we take the issue of privacy very seriously.

**Kids:** Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, e-mail address, etc.) to us or anyone else over the Internet.

**Parents and Guardians:** We encourage you to get involved with your children's online usage and to be aware of the activities in which they are participating. While we welcome all new and repeat guests to enjoy the many features of our site, we encourage you to limit your children's time online. When used properly, the Internet can be entertaining and educational. But even we at Big Idea realize that there is a lot more to a well-balanced life than corn from outer space or songs composed by a crazy cucumber.

**Information Collection Policies:**

Our "Contact Us" link allows our Customer Service people to answer questions that are not addressed by our Frequently Asked Questions page. We respond to your e-mail and then delete your name and e-mail address from our systems. If we determine that a child is e-mailing us, we respond on a one-time basis to the child's specific request and then we delete the e-mail address. We do not use any of the child's personal information in the e-mail to re-contact the child.

Big Idea does not sell, distribute, barter or transfer personally identifiable information obtained from a user (either kids or grown-ups) to a third party. However, Big Idea may be required by an order of a court or other authorized government entity to disclose such information.

**Cookies:** VeggieTales.com uses cookies to help us make the site better. A "cookie" is a small, temporary file placed on your computer's hard disk, and is used to collect user information. (Unfortunately, it's not edible!)

Cookies help us to find out what kind of computer and web browser you are using to visit our site, how often you visit our site, and which pages you look at while you're here. The information we gather from these cookies helps us to make our site available to the most people possible.

Big Idea collects aggregate information about visitors to our site. We do not use cookies to collect specific information about individual users -- your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, passwords, or anything else. Sometimes we will attach information from cookies to messages sent to our Customer Service department.

Most web browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent by changing your preferences under the options menu of your browser. However, it is possible that some portions of BigIdea.com will not function properly or may run very slowly when you change this setting on your browser.

**Changes to the Privacy Policy** : This policy is reviewed periodically by Big Idea and may be subject to change. Any changes will be posted here.
