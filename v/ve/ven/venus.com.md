Protecting your information

We want our site visitors to feel confident about using Venus to make a purchase, so we are committed to protecting the information we collect. Venus has implemented a security program to keep information that is stored in our systems protected from unauthorized access. Currently, Venus only stores the information you provide when registering at Venus. 

Our systems are configured with data encryption, or scrambling, technologies, and industry-standard firewalls. When you send personal information to Venus over the Internet, your data is protected by Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure safe transmission. 

To verify the security of our site, look at our URL in your browser window. The letter "s" added to the "http" indicates that SSL is in effect. If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0 or earlier, the broken key symbol in the lower-left corner of the browser window becomes solid when you are in secure mode. In Netscape Communicator 4.0 and 4.5, the open padlock symbol in the corner changes to closed in secure mode. In Internet Explorer 4.0, a closed padlock appears in the corner when you are in secure mode. Also, in many cases, your browser will warn you if you are about to send information via a site that is not secure.
