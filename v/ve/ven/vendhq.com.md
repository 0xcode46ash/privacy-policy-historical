# Vend | Privacy Policy | Vend

So why is this important?

This Privacy Policy explains how Vend Limited and its related entities (collectively, “Vend”, “us”, “we” or “our”) collect, use, disclose, transfer, protect and store your information. It also explains your options around our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. If you don’t agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy that’s totally fine, but unfortunately you will not be able to access or use Vend’s Services.

Scope of privacy policy

Vend is committed to protecting the privacy of the individuals on Vend’s websites, mobile applications, products and services, (collectively, "Services") that include a link to this Privacy Policy. For the purposes of this Policy, “Subscriber”, as the term is used here, refers to an individual or an entity that registers to use our Services.

In this Privacy Policy, personal information means information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. An identifiable person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identification number or to one or more factors specific to his/her physical, physiological, mental, economic, cultural or social identity.

Subscribers to our Services are solely responsible for establishing policies for and ensuring compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, as well as all privacy policies, agreements or other obligations, relating to the collection of personal information in connection with the use of our Services by individuals with whom our Subscribers interact. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services - for instance if you’re an employee or customer of a retail store - then you will be directed to contact the Subscriber - the owner or manager of the retail store - for assistance with any requests or questions relating to your personal information.

We collect information under the direction of our Subscribers, and have no direct relationship with individuals whose personal information we process in connection with the use of our Services. If you are a Subscriber providing information (including personal information) about someone else, you must have the authority to act for them and to consent to the collection and use of their personal information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you are an individual who interacts with a Subscriber using our Services and would no longer like to be contacted by this Subscriber, please contact the Subscriber directly to arrange this.

By registering for or using Services you consent to the collection, transfer, processing, storage, disclosure and other uses described in this Privacy Policy.

This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses as well as browser type, URLs of referring/exit pages, operating system, language and location preferences, time/date stamp, search history, device identification numbers and system configuration information.

If we do this, we would treat the combined information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
