Venture Encoding Service, LLC  ("Venture") is committed to your privacy, and this privacy policy is intended to help you understand Venture's policies and procedures with respect to data collection. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact us.

Venture reserves the right to change this policy at any time. If it becomes necessary to make changes to this policy, such changes will be indicated on [www.venture-encoding.com](http://www.venture-encoding.com/) (the "Site").

A.     INFORMATION COLLECTION

Venture does not attempt to solicit nor collect information about you from the Site. You may, in your sole discretion, provide information to Venture, such as in an e-mail submission, to, for example, request product information or technical support. Information provided by you will be used to support your relationship with Venture and to enable Venture to respond to any of your requests. Any information provided by you will only be used in the capacity in which you provided it, and should that capacity need to be extended, Venture will first contact you to gain permission to extend such capacity.

Venture also uses per session "cookies." Cookies are small pieces of information that the Site places on your computer's hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your web browser to block them in the future. A per session "cookie" is retained on the hard drive only while you're visiting the Site. Upon session termination or closing of the browser program, the per session "cookies" are deleted from your cache folder.

B.     ACCESS TO THE INFORMATION

Venture does not sell, trade, or rent your information to others. The information that you provide is used by Venture in order to provide you with better customer service, which may include providing you with Venture's marketing material via email or postal mail. Occasionally, Venture will hire a third party to act on its behalf for projects such as market research surveys and will provide information to these third parties specifically for use in connection with these projects. The information Venture provides to such third parties will be protected by a confidentiality agreement and will be used solely for completing the specific project.

Venture may also release or disclose your information when Venture believes, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Venture, Venture's users, or others.

C.     CHOICE AND ACCESS

D.     SECURITY

In an effort to protect your information, Venture uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology to encrypt and secure sensitive information that is exchanged from the Site to your machine. However, while Venture strives to protect your personal information, Venture does not ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

In addition, the Site may contain links to other World Wide Web sites or resources. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Venture does not have any control over these other sites, and is not responsible for actions or privacy policies of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site, or any changes or updates to such sites. Venture provides these links to these other sites to you only as a convenience, and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by Venture of any of the policies of the other sites.
