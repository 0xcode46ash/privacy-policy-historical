# Legal Disclaimers & Privacy Policy - Venture Harbour

Where we are recommending a product or service that is part of an affiliate programme, we sometimes implement affiliate links. Please note that this does not increase the cost for the buyer.

Venture Harbour regularly review products and services, such as software providers and tools. Sometimes, these are paid for or discounted by the company offering the product / service. While not always the case, it would be tedious (for us and our readers) to explain if and how we were compensated in every blog post.

To protect ourselves and preserve our reader’s experience, please assume that, for every link used and product or service mentioned on the Venture Harbour blog, one or multiple of the following may hold true:

  * We were compensated with a discount of up to 100% on the product or service being reviewed
  * We were paid a commission of any purchase value made by customers through our links
