Last Updated: January 01, 2015
Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (hereinafter, “Vets First Choice,” “we,” “us”, “our”) provides this web site located at
www.vetsfirstchoice.com, our mobile applications and all content and services available through our web site and our
mobile applications (collectively, the “Site”) subject to this Privacy Policy along with the Terms of Service for
Participating Veterinary Practices (the “Terms of Service”).
BY ACCESSING AND/OR BY USING THE SITE, YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY COLLECT, USE AND DISCLOSE
SUCH PERSONAL INFORMATION AND NON-PERSONAL INFORMATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS
PRIVACY POLICY AND TERMS OF SERVICE, AND AS PERMITTED OR REQUIRED BY LAW. If you do not agree

1. General.
We do not collect any personally identifiable information (i.e., Information that identifies you or can be used to identify
you including information) (“Personal Information”) unless you voluntarily provide it to us. While you may use some
of the functionality of the Site without registration, some of the features and services available through the Site will
require you to create an account. If you do not create an account on or through the Site, the only information we
collect from you will be “Non-Personal Information” (i.e., Information that cannot be used to identify you, including
information such as the web pages that you have viewed), as more fully described below. If you choose to create an
account through the Site, we may require you to submit Personal Information. You are responsible for ensuring the
accuracy of the Personal Information you submit to Vets First Choice. Inaccurate or out of data information will affect
the information you receive when using the Site, our ability to contact you and our ability to provide services to you.
2. The Information We Gather.
Vets First Choice gathers two types of information about users:
          2.1. Non-Personal Information. We may collect and aggregate certain Non-Personal Information from the
users of our Site, including, without limitation, data regarding, which pages of the Site were visited, the order in which
the pages of the Site were visited, and the hyperlinks which were “clicked.” Collecting such information involves the
logging of the IP addresses, operating system, and browser software used by each Site user. Although such
information is not Personal Information, we can determine from an IP address a user’s Internet Service Provider and
the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity.
Cookies allow Vets First Choice to serve you better and more efficiently, personalize your experience with the Site
and services offered on the Site, determine the length of time each user spends at any particular area of the Site, and
ascertain the specific functionality that users choose to use. Cookies also may be used to facilitate a user’s log-in, but
are not used to retain any Personal Information. Most browsers allow you to control how and whether Cookies will be
accepted. If you reject our Cookies, certain of the functions and conveniences of the Site may not work properly, but
you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to use portions of the Site.
          2.2. Personal Information. We collect Personal Information from users at several different points on this

          or any third parties unless you elect to receive additional information and promotional material from Vets

     (a) Aggregate Data. Vets First Choice may share aggregate data about the practices that participate in our Site
          and their clients with third parties, including our business partners.

          (“Consultants”) sometimes have limited access to the Personal Information that we collect through the Site
          in the course of providing products or services to Vets First Choice. These Consultants include vendors and
          suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to better operation and
          maintenance of the Site. Unless you have opted-out of receiving e-mails and newsletters from Vets First
          Choice, these Consultants also may have access to your e-mail address to send newsletters to you on our
          behalf. Access to your Personal Information by these Consultants is limited to the information reasonably
          necessary for the Consultants to perform its limited function for Vets First Choice. We also contractually
          require that our Consultants not use or disclose your Personal Information for any purpose other than
          providing us with products and services, and that the Consultants secure your Personal Information with
          safeguards equivalent to our own safeguards.
                                                               2

          process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by
          law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us. We also
          may share your Personal Information when we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action
          regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of the
          Site, our users, customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Service and other applicable
          agreements. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your Personal Information to a third party,
          we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate law or a court order. Vets First Choice reserves
          the right to report any suspected illegal activity to, and cooperate with, law enforcement individuals or
          entities for investigation or prosecution.

sharing your information (which will include Personal Information if you elect to share such information) with those
Social Media Services. As with other Third Party Sites, the information that you share with the Social Media Services

Social Media Services to, for example, control what information the Social Media Services disclose to other entities,
including Company. Please remember that the manner in which Social Media Services use, store and disclose your

8. Security.
The security and confidentiality of your Personal Information is extremely important to us. We have implemented
technical, administrative, and physical security measures to protect your Personal Information from unauthorized
access and improper use. From time to time, we review our security procedures in order to consider appropriate new
technology and methods. Despite Vets First Choice's efforts to protect your Personal Information, there is always
some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way around our security systems or that transmissions of your
information over the Internet will be intercepted. In effort to protect your Personal Information, Vets First Choice (by
itself or through its service providers) takes the following steps:
      (a) Requires both a personal username and a password in order for users to access their Personal Information;
      (b) Uses firewalls to protect information held in our servers;
      (c) Utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption in transmitting Personal Information to our servers. In order
           to take advantage of encryption technology, you must have an Internet browser which supports 128-bit
           encryption;
      (d) Monitors the limited number of Vets First Choice employees and Consultants who have potential access to
           Personal Information; and
      (e) Backs-up its systems to protect the integrity of Personal Information.
