# Pet PortalsÂ®, powered by VetInsite

We respect your privacy and that of your clients.

VetInsite encrypts all information that we receive from you when it is transferred to VetInsite. VetInsite and its personnel may access your electronic records regarding your clients and their pets, and we use this information 

_solely_

for the purpose of providing Pet Portal services and any other services you authorize us to provide. Access by VetInsite personnel to specific information is provided only on a need-to-know basis, and we have implemented safeguards and data security protocols to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of information.

On occasion, we study aggregated information on veterinary diseases and treatments and provide this information to veterinary researchers or to third parties who market their products to the veterinary industry, including veterinarians and pet owners. When VetInsite does this, it removes all identifying personal information. VetInsite never discloses to third parties any data that identifies you, your clients, or their pets.

We ask that you provide notice to your clients concerning the disclosure and/or use of individual information to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations. We provide you with a suggested form to do this.
