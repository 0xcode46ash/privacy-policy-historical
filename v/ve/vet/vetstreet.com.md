# Vetstreet - Privacy Policy

The vetstreet.com website ("our site") is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein. Your use of our site constitutes your agreement to all such terms, conditions, and notices. **If you do not agree to all of these Terms of Use, do not use Vetstreet.com.** Reference to "us" or "we" means MediMedia Animal Health, LLC.

This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect your personal information when you visit our site. Please read this privacy policy carefully and be aware that by accessing and using the site, you agree that you have read this policy and that you accept and consent to the privacy practices described. If you have questions or concerns about this policy, please e-mail us at [info@vetstreet.com](mailto:info@vetstreet.com).

### The information we collect and how we collect it

The only way we identify visitors to our site is if they choose to specifically identify themselves to us. This means we only collect personal information about you if you choose to disclose it to us (for example, when you sign up for our e-newsletter or request to receive more information about us through our "Contact Us" form, you may choose to provide your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, or information about your business). While we use recognized industry safeguards to protect personal information from unauthorized access or use, the sharing and storing of data online has inherent risks, so please take care to share only information that you believe is appropriate.

### This Web site is not designed or intended to attract children, and we do not collect or maintain information from individuals who we actually know are under the age of 13 years.

We collect your non-personal information (such as your Internet Protocol address, and the software version and domain reported by your browser), by sending "cookies" to your computer. Cookies are used to track visitors as they use our site. We uses cookies to enhance your online experience, and to learn how you use our services so we can improve the quality of information and resources available on our site. Most Web browsers are set up to accept all cookies, but you can change this setting to disable cookies or to tell you when a Web site is sending you a cookie (although some of our features may not work if you disable them).

### How we use your information

We may use your non-personal information to help us compile general statistical data for site tracking purposes. Any other personal information is used solely to provide services you have requested or authorized. We also use the information you provide to respond to your questions, provide better functionality to you, to help us manage our site, and to comply with applicable law or valid legal process. We do not sell or share the information with any other entity for marketing purposes.

We do not share a user's personal information with third party businesses for direct marketing purposes. 

### Linked sites

For your reference, this site contains links to Web sites that are not operated by or affiliated with us. Because these third-party Web sites are not under our control, we cannot be responsible for them, and this privacy policy does not apply to the privacy or security practices of those sites. Information you disclose once you access these other Web sites is not subject to this privacy policy.

### Changes to the privacy policy

From time to time, we may change this privacy policy and our privacy practices because of changes in legal or regulatory requirements, in our business practices, or in our attempts to better meet your needs. When we do, we will post a revised privacy policy on the site. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting. You are responsible for checking the privacy policy for these changes.

All trademarks, service marks, trade names, logos and graphics ("Marks") used on this site are registered or common law trademarks of MediMedia Animal Health, LLC, unless otherwise indicated. You may not make any use of Marks without the prior written consent of us.
