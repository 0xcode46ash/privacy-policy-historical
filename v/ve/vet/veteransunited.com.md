  1. ### Our Secure System Protects You

    1. We begin by safeguarding the security and integrity of customer information. We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of customer information, which is why our site is verified daily by the [McAfee Secure](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/RatingVerify?ref=72.32.169.189) service and any information you submit is encrypted and secured by a Geotrust certificate.

Only authorized employees have the ability to access your personal information, and they may only do so when helping serve your needs as our customer. We understand that online customers must be assured that their information will be kept secure, but understand that no system is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain safe.
