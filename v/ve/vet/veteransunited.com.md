## We Respect Your Privacy

We believe that customer privacy is an integral part of the customer service. Our privacy policy applies to current and former customers. We encourage you to review our privacy policy to better understand how your information will be used to provide you with the best possible service.

  1. ### Our Secure System Protects You

    1. We begin by safeguarding the security and integrity of customer information. We are committed to protecting the security and integrity of customer information, which is why our site is verified daily by the [McAfee Secure](https://www.mcafeesecure.com/RatingVerify?ref=72.32.169.189) service and any information you submit is encrypted and secured by a Geotrust certificate. You may view our Geotrust certificate and security verification information on our loan form. We use procedures and technology designed to provide the highest levels of security. Any information submitted on our site is protected with 128-bit SSL encryption. Veterans United Home Loans also uses firewalls to help protect your information. Firewalls are used at several different levels of our website, including between your computer and the webserver, database servers, and other internal production networks. These firewalls, along with Geotrust and McAfee Secure, are designed to protect our customers' information from potential hackers or others who may wish to inappropriately access your personal information. Only authorized employees have the ability to access your personal information, and they may only do so when helping serve your needs as our customer. We understand that online customers must be assured that their information will be kept secure, but understand that no system is completely secure and we cannot guarantee that your information will remain safe. You, as a consumer, should always safeguard your information and protect yourself from potential identity fraud. Rest assured that Veterans United Home Loans does everything in its power to protect your privacy.
