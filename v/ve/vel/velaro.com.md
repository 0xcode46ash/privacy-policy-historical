### How we use cookies

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your preferences.

We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website to tailor it to customer needs. We use this information for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.  
Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. Cookies also enable us to improve the performance of our messaging products by capturing your preferences. A cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the data you choose to share with us.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of our websites and products.

### Links to other websites

Our website or products may contain links to enable you to visit other websites or third party applications easily. However, once you have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over other websites or applications. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you provide whilst visiting such sites and applications and they are not governed by this privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website or application in question.

### Controlling your personal information

You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your personal information in the following ways:

**When using our website:**

  * If you have previously agreed to us using your personal information for direct marketing purposes, you may change your mind at any time by writing to or emailing us at [support@velaro.com](mailto:support@velaro.com).
  * You have a right to access the personal information that we maintain about you, and to correct, amend, or delete that information where it is inaccurate, or has been processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in the case in question, or where the rights of persons other than the individual would be violated. You may do so simply by emailing us at [support@velaro.com](mailto:support@velaro.com).



**When using our messaging products:**

We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission (as a paying customer) or you use our free service, where applicable by law. We may use your personal information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find interesting if you tell us that you wish this to happen. We will provide an individual opt-out or opt-in choice before we share your data with third parties other than our agents, or before we use it for a purpose other than which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized.

Velaro is subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We also may be required to disclose an individual’s personal information in response to a lawful request by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. In cases of onward transfer to third parties of data of EU or Swiss individuals received pursuant to the Privacy Shield Principles, Velaro is potentially liable.

### Privacy Shield Frameworks

Velaro complies with the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from European Union and Switzerland to the United States, respectively. Velaro has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles. If there is any conflict between the terms in this privacy policy and the Privacy Shield Principles, the Privacy Shield Principles shall govern.
