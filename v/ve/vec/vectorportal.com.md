We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information.

Advertisements that appear on Vectorportal are sometimes served directly to users by third party advertisers. These third party ad services may use cookies, web beacons, clear .gifs or similar technologies to help present such advertisements, and to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness. In this way, they may compile information about where individuals using your computer or browser saw their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. Occasionally, as part of advertising programs, third-party advertisers may collect personally identifiable information, such as email address and name, for promotional and advertising activities. 

Vectorportal does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third party advertisers
