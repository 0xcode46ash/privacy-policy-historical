## Cookies

### General information

Like many companies, Veeam uses cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies and data collection tools to enhance user experience, track and collect users’ online activity and to help operate the sites. It tells us such things as how many users visited our site and the pages accessed. By collecting this information, we learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. Unless you disable such technologies, by using our website and online services, you agree that we can use these types of cookies and related technologies on our website. We explain below how you can manage cookie preferences and opt-out of the collection of such information.

### Web cookie

A web cookie is a small text sent by the website to your web browser that contains your personal credentials in encrypted form as well as other personal information and personalization of the website. It is worth a note that a cookie cannot retrieve any information from your hard drive, infect your computer with viruses or steal your personal data or in any other way impair your privacy.

### Web beacon

A web beacon is a small and generally hidden GIF-image that is incorporated into a web page or an email to keep track on a user’s activity on the page or the email. Just like a cookie, a beacon tracks a user’s visit and sends the data to the server. But unlike cookies, a beacon cannot be used for identification purposes, nor can it store any data on your computer as it is not browser-based.

  * Visitors can opt out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads using the Ads Settings.
  * Veeam uses Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.
  * Third-party vendors, including Google, show Veeam ads on sites across the Internet.
  * Veeam and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website. Veeam and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how the ad impressions, other uses of ad services and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site. It also helps us try to ensure that you do not see the same advertisements repeatedly. It also helps us select and display targeted advertisements that we believe may be of interest to you. Veeam uses data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender and interests) with Google Analytics to understand overall patterns for web site usage.
