# Privacy Policy - VEX Robotics

### VEX Robotics Privacy Policy

#### Effective December 2009, updated November 2016

VEXRobotics.com recognizes the importance of protecting the privacy of the personal information collected. We are committed to safeguarding the online privacy of our users and do not intend to share, rent, or sell information to any third party. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies or organizations that VEXRobotics.com does not own or control or to people that VEXRobotics.com does not manage or employ. This policy also does not apply to sites with which VEXRobotics.com may be linked. We do not knowingly solicit or collect personally identifiable information online from children under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we learn that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from our databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personally identifiable information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at info@vexrobotics.com or by calling 1-903-453.0800.

### Privacy and Data Collection

VEX Robotics.com does not collect personal information about registrants (name, address, email) unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. VEX Robotics does not store credit card information. 

### Site Registration

Our site's order process asks users to provide contact information (such as a name and email address), unique identifiers, and demographic information (for instance, a zip code or the age of the participant). VEX Robotics.com may use customer contact information from this order process to send the users information about programs and events for which they have opted to receive additional information. If you wish to opt out of receiving such information in the future, please send us an email at info@VEXRobotics.com and tell us you want to "opt out."

### Choice/Opt-Out

We provide users with the opportunity to contact us to withdraw your consent to having your personal information stored, used or shared. If you withdraw your consent, VEX Robotics and its partners, clients, and sponsors will not contact you with information that may be of interest to you. If you do not want your personal information collected, please do not submit it to us. This site gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service.

If you wish to withdraw consent, you can:

  1. Send an email to info@vexrobotics.com
  2. Send mail to the following postal address: 1519 Interstate 30 West, Greenville, Texas 75402 
  3. Call us at 903.453.0800



### Security Statement

We use industry-standard security techniques to help protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, the information is protected both online and off-line. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it might be from VEX Robotics asking for your personal information, do not respond. We will not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail. 

Our Internet servers are housed in a firewall protected, well-controlled environment to create a high level of physical and network security to your data. The site is regularly monitored and internal and external security audits are performed to further protect all sensitive information.

### Offline Security

All users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees, such as information technology personnel and clerks, who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information.

### Links

This web site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that VEXRobotics.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites.

### Cookies

A cookie is data placed by a website on the user's hard drive when the user visits the site. It can contain information about the user's visit to the site. Any personal information a cookie contains is information the user supplies. Does VEXRobotics.com use cookies? Yes, our servers do log some cookie information when you access VEXRobotics.com, but that information does not lead us, or anyone else, back to you. Rather, the cookie stores your data once you have completed the registration process. Among other things, this saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. It also makes using VEXRobotics.com quicker. VEXRobotics.com does not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer. Except as described in this Privacy Policy, VEXRobotics.com does not use personal information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is that information shared with any third parties whatsoever. VEXRobotics.com does not use cookies to identify specific individuals, except with respect to registration.

We also use cookies to log how many people visit our site each day, the pages on the sites that were most frequently visited, and other demographic information provided by Google Analytics Advertising Features. We use this information to improve the web site content and performance. Visitors can opt-out of the Google Analytics Advertising Features through Google [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads?hl=en), Ad Settings for mobile apps, or any other available means (such as the [NAI's consumer opt-out](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the [Google Analytics Opt-Out tool](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/)).

### Other

VEXRobotics.com may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any substantial changes in the way we use your personal information, we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on our web page. We reserve the right to transfer users' personal information to a third party in the event of a transfer of all or substantially all of VEXRobotics.com assets, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this privacy policy.
