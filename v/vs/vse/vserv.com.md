# Terms and Conditions

To provide a better ad experience to the user with AudiencePro, we have partnered with several leading Telecom operators across the globe. Our partnership with these telcos provides us access to information such as location, age-group, profile and preferences which help us deliver relevant ads on your devices.  
However, Vserv does not store this information and its ownership lies solely with the Telecom operator. It remains secure with your Telecom operator and as per our agreement, Vserv does not share this information with any third party and only uses it to provide you a more relevant mobile ad experience.  
Vserv also collects data about users based on the apps and sites they visit. A cookie is created on your device which is used to collect behavioral information such as the app and site pages visited by you, the date and time of visit and the content viewed by you on these apps and sites.  
This information is then used to show you re-targeted ads which are customized to recommend you products or services best suited for you. This behavioral information is stored as anonymous data. We never collect any personally identifiable information such as your name, address, contact number or account details.  
Should you want to stop being shown re-targeted ads and opt-out of this re-targeting method, you can do so by clicking on the ‘Opt-out’ button. Once you opt out, we will insert an opt-out cookie on your device that will identify you as a user who has opted out from seeing re-targeted ads. From thereon, you will not be shown any more re-targeted ads on the apps and sites you visit.  
[ Opt Out ](http://in.sb.vserv.mobi/apro/opt-out.php)   
However, please note that we cannot ask our clients to delete any behavioral information that they already had with them before you opted out. Also, please keep in mind that you must opt-out every time you use a different browser, a different device or have cleared the opt-out cookie from your browser. This opt-out option does not keep us from showing you generic mobile ads on your device.
