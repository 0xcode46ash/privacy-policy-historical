                                                   Last updated: November 1, 2015
   Vroom, Inc. (“VROOM", “we” or "us") respects the privacy of the users of its Services (“Users” or “you”), and is
   committed to protect the personal information that its Users share with it. You have a right to know our practices
   regarding the information we may collect, use or disclose when you visit or use our Services. This Privacy Policy
   ("Privacy       Policy")     is      incorporated      into     VROOM's         Terms      of     Use       (available    at
   https://www.vroom.com/Content/pdfs/Terms_and_Conditions.pdf ) (“Terms”) by reference. Capitalized terms not
   defined herein have meaning ascribed to them in the Terms.
1.      Your Consent (PLEASE READ CAREFULLY)
   You       accept      and     agree      to     be      bound     by      this     Privacy     Policy       (available    at
   https://www.vroom.com/content/pdfs/Privacy_Policy.pdf )("Privacy Policy") by (a) checking the "I Agree to the
   Terms/Privacy Policy" box and/or (b) accessing or using one or all of the Services. The Services are available only to
   people who are at least eighteen (18) years old and possess the legal capacity to form a binding agreement with VROOM.
   IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SUCH LEGAL CAPACITY, OR IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ABIDE BY OR BE BOUND
   BY THIS PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS, USE OR REGISTER TO ANY OF OUR SERVICES.
2.      Children's Privacy
   We do not intend to and do not knowingly collect Personal Information (as defined below) from children under the age
   of eighteen (18). We reserve the right to request proof of age at any stage so that we can verify that children under the
   age of eighteen (18) are not using the Services. Please contact us at service@vroom.com if you have reasons to suspect
   that we collected Personal Information from children under the age of eighteen (18) and we will delete that information
   as quickly as possible.
3.      Which information we may collect on our Users?
   We may collect two types of information from our Users:
    a. The first type of information is non-identifiable and anonymous information (“Non-personal
        Information”). We are not aware of the identity of the User from whom we have collected the
        Non-personal Information. Non-Personal Information is any unconcealed information which does
        not enable identification of an individual User, and which is available to us while such User is accessing
        or using the Services. Non-personal Information which is being gathered consists of technical
        information, behavioral information and aggregated information, and may contain, among other things,
        the activity of the User on the Services (including page-views, click-stream, searches on the Services,
        aggregated events like completing transactions, traffic sources and navigational paths), referrals (web
        traffic), operation system, type and version of browser or mobile device, keyboard language, the
        hardware specifications of the User's device (including screen resolution and screen orientation), time
        spent on various pages of the Services, etc.
    b. The second type of information is individually identifiable information (“Personal Information”).
        This information may identify an individual or may be of a private and/or sensitive nature.
            Users of the Services may automatically provide their (a) IP address (or Mac Address, as applicable) mainly for
             enhancing the User’s experience; and (b) pages viewed by each individual User and the Submissions the User
             uploaded to the Interactive Areas.
            Users who are interested in opening an Account may be required to provide the following details: full name, e-
             mail address and a password, Zip code, vehicle’s VIN, Address and phone number.
            Alternatively, you can open an Account by integrating your existing third party accounts ("Social Network
             Account") with your Account. This can be done by Google connect, Facebook connect or Twitter Connect. If
             you authorize such integration, then certain information contained in your Social Network Account may be
             transmitted into your Account. The information currently available to us via Social Network Accounts is the
             User name and email.
                                                                 1

   provided for purchase or financing purposes) are non-confidential, may become publicly available and may be collected,
   used or redistributed by others through the internet and other media channels.
5.       What are the Purposes of the Collection of Information?

    you products or services which may interest you, or send to you other marketing materials. You may withdraw your
    consent by sending us a notice to the following email: service@vroom.com or alternatively following the opt-out

    you may be transferred to a website of an advertiser or receive any other messages, information or offers from the

    tracking technologies to collect data regarding advertisement performance, your interaction with such ads and your
    interests (which may include, Non-personal and/or Personal Information about you) in order to serve you advertisements
    and for the legitimate business interests of such third parties' ad networks. We recommend that you review the terms of
    use and privacy policy of any advertiser with which you are interacting, since their privacy policy, not ours, will apply
    to any of those interactions.
11.      Third Party Service Providers
    We may be using third party software or service in order to collect, host, store and/or process information. We use
    commercially reasonable efforts to engage with third parties that post a privacy policy governing their collection,
    processing and use of Non-personal and Personal Information. Such third party service providers include, without
    limitation: Microsoft Azure, whose privacy policy can be found at http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/trust-
                                                                  4

    and at http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html; and RouteOne, whose privacy policy can be
    found at https://www.routeone.com/terms-conditions. We do not control third party service providers. Please read their
    terms of use and privacy policies to better understand their privacy practices.
12.       Links to Third Party Websites or Services
    One or all of the VROOM Services may contain links to non-VROOM websites or services for your convenience only;
    they are not under our control and we do not endorse or assume any responsibility for their content, information or
    functionality. Your access or use of any non-VROOM websites or services or reliance upon their content is at your own
    risk. Most of the linked sites or services provide legal documents, including terms of use and privacy policy, governing
    their use. The information they collect about you should be specified in such documents.
13.       Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies
    When you access or use our Services, we or our third party service providers (including without limitation, Google
    Analytics) may use industry-wide technologies such as "cookies", local storage capabilities, or other similar technologies,
    which store certain local information on your computer and/or track User usage patterns ("Tracking Technologies").
    These Tracking Technologies allow the collection of Non-personal Information and Personal Information (e.g. pages
    viewed by a User within a certain Service, the duration of the browsing, etc.). The Tracking Technologies enable, inter
    alia, automatic activation of certain features and make the User’s experience and usage simpler, more relevant,
    convenient and effortless.
    We and our third party service providers may use both session cookies (which expire once the User closes the browser)
    and persistent cookies (which stay on the User's browser and may be used by the browser on subsequent visits to the
    Service(s), unless deleted by the User).
    Most browsers will allow you to erase cookies from your computer's hard drive or from your device, block acceptance
    of cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. In order to erase or disable the Tracking Technologies you
    may use the settings of your browser or mobile device. However, if you block or erase Tracking Technologies then our
    Services (and your User experience) may be limited.
14.       Changes to the Privacy Policy
    VROOM reserves the right to make changes to its Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason, so please re-visit this
    page frequently. If VROOM makes material changes to the Privacy Policy, then VROOM will either notify you by email
    or by posting a notice on the Services. These changes will come into effect seven (7) days after such notice was provided
    on the Services or sent to you by e-mail, whichever is earlier. Otherwise, all changes are effective as of the date indicated
    at the top of this page ("Last Updated") and your continued use of the Service(s) after the indicated date will constitute
    acceptance to be bound by those changes. If the Privacy Policy must be amended in order to comply with any legal
    requirements, the amendments may take effect immediately or as required by law and without any prior notice.
    VROOM reserves the right to stop, temporarily or permanently, the operation of any and all Services without notice, at
    any time. All information (ours or yours) made available on the applicable Service may be removed or deleted and you
    are required to make your own copy of any information you submit to VROOM. VROOM will not be liable to you or to
    any third party for any changes, suspension, or discontinuance of the Service(s) or any malfunctions that may occur in
    connection thereto.
