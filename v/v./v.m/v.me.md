## V.me Privacy Policy — Core Services

Welcome to V.me from Visa Inc. ("Visa", "we" or "us"). Please read below to learn how we collect, protect and use your data.

This privacy policy applies to the core V.me services, so start here. If you sign up for additional V.me services or for services that your issuer or another third party operates that may be accessible through V.me, there may be additional or different privacy policies (such as your card issuer’s privacy policy) which describe any additional or different data practices that apply to those services. Also, other Visa products and websites have their own separate privacy policies. The Visa.com privacy policy does not apply to V.me.

This privacy policy was last updated May 07, 2013.

## How we protect your Personal Information

Visa uses firewalls and Secure Socket Layers to help protect the Personal Information we collect from you when it is being communicated to us.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may change this privacy policy at any time by posting an updated privacy policy to the site. Changes will be effective when you accept the updated privacy policy or 30 days after the "Last Updated" date in the updated privacy policy, whichever comes first. If you don't affirmatively accept the updated privacy policy, your use of V.me after the 30 day posting period means you are subject to the updated privacy policy.
