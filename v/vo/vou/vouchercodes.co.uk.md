The following Privacy Statement relates to:

DiscountCodes has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our online information gathering and dissemination practices.

Our overall policy is extremely simple: If we collect information from you, we use it only for the purposes for which it was collected, and the other limited purposes outlined below.

Here are the details of our privacy policies. This statement may change over time and therefore it is recommended that you review it periodically.

 ** _3\. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED; USES OF INFORMATION_**  
We collect some non-personally identifiable information automatically and some in our registration forms and online surveys.

Our site's registration form and online surveys may request or require users to provide personally identifiable information (like their name, gender, age and e-mail address). We may use the information from our registration forms and surveys to contact the user, but users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). We will not sell or disclose your personally identifiable data to any third party unless:

(iv) we are required by law to disclose it.
