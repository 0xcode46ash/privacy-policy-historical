Voucherify makes use of cookies to provide its Users with a customised product/service through identifying unique visitors and their respective usage patterns. Cookies are identifiers placed on a User’s hard drive by the server and allow Voucherify to streamline its products to better suit Users’ needs.

Demographic and traffic data may be collected by third parties on our website. Third parties may also use cookies, for which we have neither access nor control.

The combination of this data could inadvertently lead to the identification of individual Users. User data may from time to time be collected and analysed for statistical purposes, though in this case no individual’s data will be identified. If the User has agreed to provide their information to third parties with the ultimate goal of receiving personalised products and services, then Voucherify may provide said third parties with the relevant data. In this case, we rely on technical and organisational means to assure that applicable data security regulations are followed.

All information, whether on data processors on Voucherify’s premises or on servers acting on Voucherify’ behalf, remains in complete control of Voucherify at all times. Servers may be located in jurisdictions where data protection laws differ from those in the User’s jurisdiction.

## 6. Re-targeting
