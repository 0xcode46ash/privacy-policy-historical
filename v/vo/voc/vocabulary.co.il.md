# Privacy Policy | Legal

Privacy Policy Updated: August 2009

At Vocabulary.co.il, we consider children’s safety–which is related to privacy–to be all-important.

Our site complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act “COPPA”, which you may read about [here](http://www.coppa.org/comply.htm).

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully because it describes our privacy practices and helps distinguish our service from others which have different policies. If you have questions or comments on our policy, we would very much like to hear from you using the contact us function on the website.

### Identity of Registrants

Vocabulary.co.il provides spelling practice on a website where teachers and parents can post word lists. To maximize privacy and security, we require teachers and parents to set up accounts if they wish to post word lists or comments. In addition, we verify each user with a verification email that assures that the email that they registered under is actually available to them. This does not verify identity beyond the confirmation of the email.

You should be aware that if you register for an account as a parent or educator, your name and user name become viewable by the public. Vocabulary.co.il has no method for verifying whether someone who registers as a teacher at a particular school is truly that teacher or works at that school.

Therefore it is possible for a person to register and post while posing as a teacher or parent when they are not actually a teacher or parent. It is actually common on the internet for people to register using false information about themselves. On at least one occassion, someone (a student or someone else) has posed as a particular teacher to post a “spoof” list and/or comments.

All Vocabulary.co.il users should be aware of this possibility and take appropriate precautions. When made aware of a fradulent account, Vocabulary.co.il will take measures to ban that user. However, these measures are limited to closing the particular account and banning future registrations using the particular email.

### Appropriateness

Vocabulary.co.il has taken a number of measures to prevent the posting of profanity or other objectionable language on our website. For instance, we automatically drop known profane terms from all lists. Also, we do not include body parts on the list of words in our library. However, no protective measures can be fool-proof.

### Supervision

Children on the internet should be closely supervised and instructed about security, and this is the parent’s responsibility. We recommend that parents provide the following information to all children: [Kids’ Rules for Online Safety](http://www.safekids.com/kids-rules-for-online-safety/).

### Display of Registrant Identify

Vocabulary.co.il is a web 2.0 social media-type website which includes user-generated content in terms of posted spelling lists and discussions on the forum. While the forum is moderated, the problems of misinformation, false identities and other risks typical of the internet in its current state also exist on Vocabulary.co.il. You are advised that when you register with Vocabulary.co.il, your name and username will be displayed on the Vocabulary.co.il website associated with your selected school and will be viewable by people and by automated systems, such as the automated indexing software utilized by Google, Yahoo, and Bing.

**Vocabulary.co.il does not disclose user personal information to outside parties (except as described above). Vocabulary.co.il will not sell or share email addresses with any outside group**. Vocabulary.co.il has appropriate security measures in place to safeguard against unauthorized access to the personal information collected at our Web site, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as electronic security systems and password protections.

### What about the collection of information by third parties?

Our web site contains links to web sites not maintained by Vocabulary.co.il. The privacy and data collection practices on any linked web sites are entirely separate from those of Vocabulary.co.il and are not covered by this Privacy Policy. We cannot guarantee that student users will not go to another site where personal information from them is solicited. Vocabulary.co.il does have limited advertising on the site and takes measures to maintain the appropriateness of the advertising material to the educational mission of Vocabulary.co.il. Google’s Adsense service is our primary supplier of advertising; Google’s activities includes placing “cookies” on user computers in order to track user movement through various websites on the internet.

### What security measures do we take?

All personal information provided by customers is kept in our secure database and is protected by our security measures, which are periodically reviewed.
