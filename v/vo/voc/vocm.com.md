**Personal Information**

“Personal Information” in this policy is defined as information that could reasonably personally identify you as an individual. Examples would include your name, mailing and e-mail addresses, age, birthday, telephone number, picture and voice recording. This policy describes the types of Personal Information that we collect, how we collect it, why we collect it and what we use it for. 

“Non-identifiable Personal Information” is information that cannot be associated with, or traced back to, a specific person. Anonymous aggregated information, information about your visits to our websites which is not linked to you, information about your computer’s operating system and web browser software would be considered as Non-identifiable Personal Information. Your computer and its operating systems, browsers, and memory contain vast quantities of transaction data and records of your use of it. This Personal Information could be gleaned from these systems by outsiders if you do not take steps to protect your system. It is our policy not to associate this information with customers, even though we verify some kinds of technical information to ensure that our websites are optimized to serve our customers.

If you register, and in the process provide us with Personal Information, rest assured that any such information you provide will not be shared with any third-party organization except with your express consent. 

Particular care is employed when we collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13. Personal Information from children is not required to obtain access to, surf or view the content of our websites. However, for a child to participate in our contests or promotions, certain Personal Information may be required. Under this scenario, we may collect the first and last name (or user name) of the child, the child’s e-mail address, home address, birth date and gender, as well as the name, home address, e-mail address and telephone number of the child’s parent or guardian. 

Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 is only collected when it is necessary for the purposes of verifying the child’s age, administering the child’s participation in the contest or promotion and, if the child wins a prize, contacting the child’s parent or guardian. We will not use, maintain or disclose this Personal Information for any other purpose. 

The parent or guardian of any child can contact us at any time to get more information about our Personal Information practices or to remove the child’s Personal Information from our records. 

We also provide visitors to our websites the opportunity to opt-in to receive communications from us. In this case, we may ask the visitor for his or her email address, first name and last name, or username, address, city, province, phone number, postal code and birth date.

You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications by emailing us at [webmaster@newcap.ca ](mailto:webmaster@newcap.ca), by replying to any email we send you and entering the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line, or by visiting one of our websites and logging into your account and choosing unsubscribe.
