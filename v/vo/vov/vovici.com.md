# Privacy Policy - Vovici

Last revised: May 2012

Verint Systems Inc. and its [ subsidiaries](http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1166388/000110465912023217/a12-2869_1ex21d1.htm) (collectively, “Verint”) are concerned about privacy issues and wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect through the website owned and controlled by us from which you are accessing this Privacy Policy (the "Site") as well as certain information we collect from offline sources, as explained in more detail below. By providing Personal Information (defined below) to us, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

If you apply for a job through the Site, our use of the Personal Information you provide through our Career Center is governed by a separate privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. Please click <http://verint.com/corporate/careers_list.cfm> to review our privacy policy for job seekers who apply for jobs through the Site.

Verint complies with the U.S. - E.U. and US- Swiss Safe Harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union and Switzerland. Information regarding the E.U. and Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks can be found at: <http://export.gov/safeharbor>. A copy of Verint's Safe Harbor policy can be found at: <http://www.vovici.com/safeharbor.aspx>.

**Personal Information We Collect**  
"Personal Information" is information that identifies you as an individual, such as:

  * Name
  * Postal address (including billing and shipping addresses)
  * Telephone number
  * Email address
  * Organization and job title or function
  * Login ID, PIN or other Password for access to certain content on the Site



We may merge Personal Information collected through the Site with Personal Information that we collect about you offline, such as business contact information that we receive in connection with sales presentations, your e-mails to us or your purchases from us, information gathered when you attend a trade show, seminar or other business event, or information provided by your employer if your company enrolls you in a training event. All such merged Personal Information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

We use third-party payment services ("Payment Service") to collect payments for purchases made through the Site. If you wish to make a payment through the Site, you will be directed to a webpage that is hosted by the Payment Service (or the Payment Service's service providers) and not by Verint. Any Personal Information that you provide through the Payment Service's webpage will be collected by Payment Service and not by us, and will be subject to Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION BY SUCH PAYMENT SERVICES.

**How We Use Personal Information**  
We may use Personal Information:

  * To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you e-mail alerts, white papers or information about our company, products and services.

  * Demographic information and other information provided by you
  * Aggregated information



**How We Collect Other Information**  
We and our third party service providers may collect Other Information in a variety of ways, including:

  * **Through your browser:** Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version and Internet browser type and version. We use this information to ensure that our Site functions properly.
  * **Using cookies:** Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Site, pages visited, language preferences and Verint services visitors choose to use. We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, display information more effectively, and to personalize your experience while visiting the Site, as well as for online tracking purposes. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Site. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Site in order to continually improve the design and functionality, understand how customers use the Site and to assist us with resolving questions regarding the Site.

You can refuse to accept these cookies by configuring your web browser settings to automatically reject cookies or to prompt you to accept cookies; for more information about how to do this, please refer to your browser's Help documentation. However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Site.

  * **Using pixel tags and other similar technologies:** Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to, among other things, track the actions of Site users and email recipients, measure the success of our marketing campaigns and compile statistics about Site usage and response rates.
  * **IP Address:** Your "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited. Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites. We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering the Site.
  * **From you:** Information such as your location, as well as other information, such as your preferred means of communication or areas of interest, is collected when you voluntarily provide this information. Unless combined with Personal Information, this information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site.
  * **By aggregating information:** Aggregated Personal Information does not personally identify you or any other user of the Site, (for example, we may aggregated Personal Information to calculate the percentage of our users who have a particular telephone area code).



**How We Use and Disclose Other Information**  
Please note that we may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law. If we are required to treat Other Information as Personal Information under applicable law, then, in addition to the uses listed in the "How We Collect Other Information" section above, we may use and disclose Other Information for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information.

In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information as long as it is combined.

**Third Party Sites**  
This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site to which this Site contains a link. The inclusion of a link on the Site does not imply endorsement of the linked site by us or by our affiliates.

**Security**  
We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect Personal Information under our control. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
