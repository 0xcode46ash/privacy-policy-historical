This privacy policy was last updated: December 14, 2001.

The Independent Print Media Group is committed to providing its customers and clients with the highest possible standards of product and service. As part of that commitment we have produced the following privacy policy statement to help you better understand the privacy issues that arise as a result of the use of our website products and services.

This policy statement will address the following:

  * The types of information we collect 
  * How we use or disclose the information we collect 
  * The quality and security of the information we hold 
  * Your access to the information we hold 
  * Transborder (interstate and international) data movement 
  * Your participation on our websites 
  * Links to other websites 
  * Our policy on children's privacy protection 
  * How to contact us for more information 

**The types of information we collect**   
In general, when you visit our websites you do not have to tell us who you are, or reveal any personally identifiable information to us. Unless you specifically agree to tell us, we will never know who you are, and you are able to interact with our websites in a completely anonymous way. 

Personally identifiable information is defined as any specific data that could disclose you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, billing and shipping information, credit card information or e-mail address.

When you visit our websites our servers automatically record basic information about your usage, such as the type of internet browser and operating system you are using, the date, time and duration of your visit and the pages you viewed. This information is anonymous and does not identify you as an individual, nor will we combine it with information that does identify you as an individual. This information is collected and analysed to provide us with a greater understanding of how you use our websites. 

Where necessary we collect personally identifiable information on certain areas of our websites, for example, if you register on a forum, enter a competition or subscribe to an e-mail newsletter. The personally identifiable information collected may consist of a username or unique user ID and contact information, such as your name, email address, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers. You may have the opportunity to make purchases on our websites, in which case we would need to collect your order information, credit card details and delivery instructions in order to facilitate payment and shipment.

From time to time a pop-up window may invite you to answer survey questions and provide certain demographic information, such as your age, sex, income bracket, country of access, and location of connection, (e.g. home or work).
