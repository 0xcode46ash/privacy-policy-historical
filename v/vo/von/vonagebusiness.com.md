Unless you consent, Vonage will never share the personal information you provide to us except as described below. Vonage may disclose your personal information to third- parties under any of the following circumstances:

• In the context of a business transaction, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or divestiture, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.  
• We may share aggregate and de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes. For example, we may provide aggregated information about users to describe our services to current and prospective partners and other third parties.

## Your Choices About Receiving E-Mail

Vonage may send you e-mail about your account, about the services you have purchased, to remind you about services that are available, or in response to your questions. Vonage may also send you e-mail with information and/or special offers about products and services that may be of interest. In addition, with your assent, we may share your email address with our business partners who may also send you promotional emails.

Vonage gives you the ability to opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us at any time, by following the opt-out or unsubscribe instructions contained in each promotional e-mail sent by Vonage or by contacting Vonage as provided below and requesting that you be unsubscribed:

**• Email:** [billing@vonagebusiness.com](mailto:billing@vonagebusiness.com)  
**• Telephone:** 1-866-901-0242

If you opt-out of receiving promotional emails from us, we may still send you e-mails about your account or any products or services you have requested or received from us. In addition, you must opt out separately from receiving promotional emails from our partners by following the opt-out instructions contained in such emails from those business partners; your unsubscribe request to Vonage does not opt you out of future emails from business partners with whom we have already shared your email address. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us and our business partners to process your opt-out requests.

## Cookies and Other Browser Information

We and our service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track information about your use of our websites and services.  We may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.

_Cookies.   _Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your web browser for record-keeping purposes. We may use cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our websites and services, to customize the content and services we make available to you, to enable a faster log-in process, or to track your activities at our websites.

All sections of Vonage’s websites where you are prompted to log in or that are customizable require your browser to accept cookies. If you do not want your information to be stored by cookies, you can configure your browser so that it always rejects these cookies or asks you each time if you accept them or not. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, you will not be able to use certain services or features of our websites if you disable cookies.

_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies_.  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We, or our service providers, may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our websites to, among other things, track the activities of website visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about website usage.  We, and our service providers, also use clear GIFs in HTML e-mails to our customers, to help us track e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and track whether our e-mails are forwarded.

_Third Parties_.  We use automated devices and applications, such as Google Analytics, to evaluate usage of our websites and, to the extent permitted, our services and proprietary applications.  We also may use other analytic means to evaluate our services.  We use these tools to help us improve our services, performance and user experiences.   We may also engage third parties to track and analyze website data.  We use the data collected by such third parties to help us administer and improve the quality of our website and to analyze website usage.  Such third parties may combine the information that we provide about you with other information that they have collected.  This Privacy Policy does not cover such third parties’ use of the data.

## About Links to Other Sites

Our websites may contain links to other sites operated by third parties. Vonage does not control the information collection of these third party sites; this Privacy Policy does not apply to such third-party sites. If you have questions about the data collection procedures of linked sites, please contact those companies directly.

## How to Contact Us

Vonage gives you the ability to access, modify or update your information at any time. Also, if you have any questions about any of these practices or Vonage’s use of your personal information, please feel free to contact us via email at [billing@vonagebusiness.com](mailto:billing@vonagebusiness.com) or calling Vonage at 1-866-901-0242. Vonage will work with you to resolve any concerns you may have about this Policy.

## Changes to this Privacy Statement

Vonage reserves the right to change this policy from time to time. If we do make changes, the revised Privacy Policy will be posted on this site. A notice will be posted on our homepage whenever this Privacy Policy is changed in a material way.
