# Vodafone - Privacy Policy

Vodafone Limited (hereinafter referred to as "Vodafone" "us" "we" or "our") is committed to respecting your privacy and to complying with applicable data protection and privacy laws. You can visit our web and WAP sites without disclosing any personally identifiable information about yourself (although please note that we may use cookies and collect other non-personally identifiable information about your browsing activity - see below for more information). If you do submit personal information by ordering products, or services, for example, you can be assured that we will use your personal information only to support your continuing relationship with Vodafone.

We have provided this Privacy Policy Statement to help you understand how we collect, use and protect your information when you visit our web and WAP sites and when you generally use our products and services. We wish to help you make informed decisions, so please take a few moments to read the sections below and learn how we may use your personal information.

You should read this notice in conjunction with the terms & conditions of use for Vodafone Web and WAP sites and any separate terms & conditions issued with your airtime or other product/service contract.  
  
We endeavor to collect and use your personal information only with your knowledge and consent and typically when you order and subsequently use products and services, make customer enquiries, register for information or other services, request product information, submit a job application or when you respond to communications from us (such as questionnaires or surveys).

The type of personal information we may collect could include, for example, your name and postal address, date of birth, gender, telephone and fax numbers, email address, and credit/debit card information; lifestyle and other information collected on registration or through surveys. If you choose to provide us with personal information it will be used in support of the intended purposes stated at the time at which it was collected, and subject to any preferences indicated by you.   
  
We may also collect non-personally identifying information about your visit to our web, WAP and other similar sites based on your browsing (click-stream) activities. This information may include the pages you browse and products and services viewed or ordered for example. This helps us to better manage and develop our sites, to provide you with a more enjoyable, customised service and experience in the future, and to help us develop and deliver better products and services tailored to your individual interests and needs.   
  
We may use your information for a number of purposes which includes: processing your orders and managing and administering your account; delivering any services, products or information requested by you; responding to complaints or account enquiries; administering debt recoveries; verifying your identity when required (you may lose your password or security information for example, and we may then need to ask you for other 'identifiable' information to protect your data from unauthorised access).

We may also undertake market and product analysis based on your use of our services and products and contact you with information about new developments, products, services and special offers by post, telephone and automated means such as mobile text message (SMS), Email, Fax, Pager, WAP and the world wide web (subject to any preferences expressed by you).

We may also tell you about the products and services of carefully selected third parties and allow you to receive advertising and marketing information from those selected third parties without passing control of your personal information to the third party. For example we may send you information with your bill, or you may simply receive an advertisement on your personal web and WAP page according to any preferences indicated by you and/or according to your interests. This helps us to make you aware of products and services that we may have specially negotiated for our own customers and which may be of individual interest to you.   
  
We may disclose information about you, your account and your mobile phone to (i) companies within the Vodafone Group for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement; and (ii) in the event that we undergo re-organisation or are sold to a third party, in which case you agree that any personal information we hold about you may be transferred to that re-organised entity or third party for the purposes and subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy Statement. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy Statement, "Vodafone Group" means Vodafone Group Plc and any company or other entity in which Vodafone Group Plc owns (directly or indirectly) more than 15% of the issued share capital. Companies in the Vodafone Group shall include, without limitation, Vodafone Corporate Limited, Vodafone Multimedia Limited, Vodafone Retail Limited, Vodafone UK Limited, Vizzavi Limited and Vizzavi UK Limited. 

Please note that Vodafone does not sell or pass your personal information to third parties (other than as set out in the paragraph above) unless you have given us permission or unless it is necessary to deliver the products and services ordered or used by you. For example, we may disclose your data to a credit card company to validate your credit card details and obtain payment when you buy a phone or other product or service. It may also be necessary to pass your data to the organisation from whom you have ordered any products or services, such as a location-based service like for example 'Tell me where my nearest music shop is'.

Vodafone may also be obliged to disclose your personal information to meet any legal or regulatory requirements or obligations in accordance with applicable law.   
  
We may use cookies to record details such as a user identity and general registration details on your PC. This helps us recognise you on subsequent visits so that you don't have to re-enter your registration details each time you visit us and allows us to carry out those activities mentioned in the above section "non-personally identifying information".
