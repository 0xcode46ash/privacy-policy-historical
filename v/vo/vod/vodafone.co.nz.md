We collect information relating to you that you have provided to us (for example, on an application or registration form or through the way you use our products and services) or that we may have obtained from another source (such as our suppliers or from marketing organisations and credit agencies).

This information may include, your name, address, telephone numbers, information on how you use our products and services (such as the type, date, time, location and duration of calls or messages, the numbers you call and how much you spend, and information on your browsing activity when visiting one of our group companies' websites), the location of your mobile phone from time to time, lifestyle information and any other information collected in relation to your use of our products and services.

Where such contact is via electronic means, our terms and conditions record our agreement with you that the electronic marketing messages we and our selected third parties send don't need to include an unsubscribe facility;

2.13 for general administrative and business purposes. 

### 3\. Sharing your information

There may be times when we need to disclose your personal information to third parties. If we do this, we will only disclose your information to:

3.1 our group companies (some of which are based outside of New Zealand) who may use and disclose your information for the same purposes as us; 

3.2 those who provide to us or our group companies products or services that support the services that we provide, such as our dealers and suppliers;

3.3 credit reference agencies (unless we have agreed otherwise), who may share your information with other organisations and who may keep a record of the searches we make against your name; 

3.4 if someone else pays your bill, such as your employer, that person; 

3.5 those providing telephone and similar directories or directory enquiry services;

3.6 anyone we transfer our business to in respect of which you are a customer or a potential customer;

3.7 anyone who assists us in protecting the operation of the Vodafone networks and systems, including the use of monitoring and detection in order to identify potential threats, such as hacking and virus dissemination and other security vulnerabilities;

3.8 anyone who hosts or maintains data centres, service platforms and other infrastructure and systems on behalf of us and our group companies, where your information is processed;

3.9 persons to whom we may be required to pass your information by reason of legal, governmental or regulatory authority including law enforcement agencies and emergency services;

3.10 any person or organisation as authorised by the Privacy Act 1993 and/or the Telecommunications Information Privacy Code 2003.

If you have not opted out of receiving marketing material from us, we may also provide your personal information to carefully selected third parties who we reasonably believe provide products or services that may be of interest to you and who have contracted with Vodafone to keep the information confidential, or who are subject to obligations to protect your personal information.

If you would like to opt-out of receiving Vodafone marketing materials, please contact 777 from your Vodafone mobile or go to [My Vodafone](http://www.vodafone.co.nz/myvodafone/ "My Account") at www.vodafone.co.nz. Even if you opt out, Vodafone will still need to send you essential information about your account or changes to your service.

### 4\. Sharing your information outside New Zealand

If you wish to use our products or services abroad, your information may be transferred outside New Zealand to that country. Our websites and systems and those of our group companies may also be based on servers located outside of New Zealand. Please note that the data protection and other laws of countries outside New Zealand may not be as comprehensive as the laws of this country.

### 5\. Protecting your personal information

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete, up-to-date and stored in a secure environment protected from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

### 6\. Accessing your personal information

You have the right to access your personal information, if we hold that personal information in a way that it can be readily retrieved. You may request access to the personal information we hold about you by sending an email to [customerprivacy@vodafone.co.nz](mailto:customerprivacy@vodafone.co.nz "Mail to customerprivacy@vodafone.co.nz").

Please quote your name and address. We would be grateful if you could also provide brief details of what information you want a copy (this helps us to more readily locate your data).

In some cases, there may be a charge associated with providing copies of your personal information to you. If so, we will advise you of this prior to sending your information to you.

### 7\. Internet use

We make every effort to maintain the security of our internet connections; however for reasons outside of our control, security risks may still arise. Any personal information transmitted to us or from our online products or services will therefore be at your own risk, however we will use our best efforts to ensure that any such information remains secure. We cannot protect any information that you make available to the general public – for example, on message boards or in chat rooms.

Please note that when you are accessing a non-Vodafone website, you should always read their privacy policy or website terms and conditions – especially if you are considering providing them with your personal information. You are also responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information.

We may use cookies and other interactive techniques such as web beacons to collect non-personal information about how you interact with our website, and web-related products and services, to:

7.1 understand what you like and use about our website;  
7.2 understand what you do not like and do not use on our website;   
7.3 provide a more enjoyable, customised service and experience, and   
7.4 help us develop and deliver better products and services tailored to our customers' interests and needs.

We may use a persistent cookie to record details such as a unique user identity and general registration details on your PC. This helps us recognise you on subsequent visits to this website so that you don't have to re-enter your registration details each time you visit us and allows us to carry out the activities mentioned above.

Most browser technology (such as Internet Explorer, Netscape etc) allows you to choose whether to accept cookies or not – you can either refuse all cookies or you can set your browser to alert you each time that a website tries to set a cookie. 

### 8\. Changes to our Privacy Policy 

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time.
