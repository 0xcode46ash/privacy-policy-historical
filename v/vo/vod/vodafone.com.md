# Privacy policy - Vodafone

Vodafone Group provides this information to help you understand how we collect, use and share your information when you visit vodafone.com.

**What we collect and how we use it**  
Some parts of vodafone.com allow you to give us personal information. When you visit the site or communicate with us, we’ll use the information you provide in the ways you’d reasonably expect us to – for example, service delivery or improvement or customer support. Where you have choices about how we use the information you provide, we’ll tell you so at the point of collection.

Because of the way this website operates, we may also use information from your browser or browsing activities to personalize the site or route you to relevant information. For example, we may use web-log information, cookies or web beacons in ways that help us maintain some of your site preferences, send you to the right country-specific information or understand how our visitors navigate the site so we can make it better. You can choose whether or not to allow cookies or web beacons using your browser preferences. [Click here](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/faqs#14) for more information about cookies and your choices.

**Sharing information within the Vodafone corporate family**  
Some of the services or information you can request on this site may come from other members of our corporate family. Therefore, we may share your information with other companies within [Vodafone Group](https://web.archive.org/content/index/about/about_us/where.html) (for example, your local carrier). The laws of the countries where these companies are based may not be the same as those in the EU, but your information will be treated with the same high standard of care wherever it’s processed within the corporate family.

**Changes to this policy**  
From time to time, we may need to update this statement because of a change in the website’s functionality or in applicable laws. When we do so, we’ll note on the website that the policy has been changed. Changes will go into effect 30 days after we post the new policy.
