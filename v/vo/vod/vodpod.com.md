# Vodpod: privacy

Principles of the VodPod Privacy Policy  


  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.   

  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, to provide a service you have requested, or to protect our rights.
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.   




**_What This Privacy Policy Covers_**

  * This privacy policy governs the use of the VodPod web site at http://www.vodpod.com/ 
  * It covers how VodPod treats personal information -- that is, personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number. 
  * Children under 13 are not permitted to use the VodPod service, and so this privacy policy makes no provision for children's use of the site. 



**General Information**

  * VodPod collects personal information when you register with VodPod to use VodPod services or to post content on VodPod. 
  * When you register, we ask for your email address. 
  * If you upgrade to buy more VodTone, we will ask for your billing information such as your address and credit card information. Currently, we use PayPal to process payments, and your payment information resides with PayPal, on their servers, subject to their [privacy policies](http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/ua/policy_privacy-outside "PayPal Privacy Policy"). VodPod currently does not store any billing information you provide.  

  * If you are a member who has uploaded premium content, or created a Pod with premium content, we will ask for certain information in order to make payment to you, such as your e-mail address, phone number, and name and address to which payment should be sent.  

  * VodPod receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, cookie, and the page you request in order to operate the VodPod service.
  * VodPod uses Google Analytics to view aggregate statistics about the usage of the VodPod service.  




**IP Addresses**

IP Addresses are automatically reported by your browser each time you view a web page.   


IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including: 

  * To diagnose or service technology problems reported by our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP. 
  * To tailor advertising based on geographic area or other information derived from your IP address. Aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers. 
  * To estimate the total number of users visiting VodPod from specific geographical regions. 
  * To make sure that people are not voting for themselves or friends during contests or promotions.
