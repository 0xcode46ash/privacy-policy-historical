Whenever you enter our website, our web server automatically collects and aggregates information in respect of your visit. This information includes URLs or domains of referring websites, browser type, operating system, the pages that you access and the date and time of your visit. 

**Voki Usage**  
In order to make the services that we offer more relevent and useful, we may collect aggregate data on asset utilization and consumer preferences by user demographic. For example, if most female users prefer a certain set of characters, we may use that data to start sorting our character selection lists based on the demographic profile of a user when they are logged in to improve our service. This type of data usage will generally be aggregated, non personally identifiable, and used directly in conjunction with a service offering intended to improve user experience.
