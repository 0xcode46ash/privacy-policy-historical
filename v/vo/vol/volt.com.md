Safe Harbor
With respect to Personal Information associated with individuals located in European Economic Area
(EEA) countries (“EEA Data Subjects”), the Company abides by a self-regulatory program in compliance
with the requirements of the Safe Harbor Program (www.export.gov/safeharbor). With respect to EEA
Data Subjects – in the event that the Company seeks or intends to (a) disclose Personal Information to
a third party or (b) use Personal Information for reasons incompatible with the purpose for which it was
originally collected, such individuals are provided with an opportunity to opt out of said disclosure and/or
use; disclosure of Personal Information to a third party relating to EEA Data Subjects, if any, is limited
to those subscribing to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles or comparable methods of protection; express
consent of EEA Data Subjects is required in the event that the Company wishes to disclose or use
Personal Information of a sensitive nature (i.e. medical condition, racial or ethnic origin, political
                                                        1


opinions or affiliations, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or information relating
to sexual identify or practices). Questions or concerns by EEA Data Subject(s) relative to handling of
Personal Information should be directed to dataprotection@volt.eu.com.
** Volt is aware of the Court of Justice of the European Union’s decision in the case of Schrems v Data
Protection Commissioner and in keeping with its long standing certification under the Safe Harbor
program, we remain committed to compliance with data protection legislation, in all the countries in
which we do business. At this time we are awaiting updated guidance from the Information
Commissioners Office in London and once that guidance is released, we will update our practises in
compliance with its terms.
Solicitations and/or Marketing Contacts
The Company does not sell, convey and/or communicate customer/client, business associate, supplier,
vendor, employee and/or candidate Personal Information to third parties for purposes of direct mail,
telemarketing, and/or related promotions, solicitations or marketing contacts.
Management of Personal Information
The Company uses a combination of reasonable security technologies, policies and procedures, and
non-disclosure, confidentiality and/or other forms of agreement(s) to help protect your Personal
Information from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure. In the event
that local law in the country of disclosure or use of Personal Data is more stringent than the
requirements set out in this policy, local law will prevail over this policy to the extent necessary to
meet the requirements of that legislation.
