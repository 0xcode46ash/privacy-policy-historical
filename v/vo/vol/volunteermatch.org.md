This notice of our privacy policy is intended to help you understand our online information security practices.

**How We Use Information**

We use the information we collect about you to facilitate the volunteering process and to provide information to you about VolunteerMatch and related industry topics. Please be aware that, to the extent required to provide our services, we share your information with volunteers or nonprofit organization partners, as applicable. If you indicate on our site that you are interested in a particular volunteer opportunity and provide us with your contact information, we will forward your contact information to the organization that is hosting that opportunity so that the organization can contact you regarding your potential involvement. 

Nonprofits who receive email addresses from potential volunteer signups are strongly encouraged to adopt privacy standards similar to those of VolunteerMatch. Each such organization has its own policies regarding collection and use of personal information and we are not responsible for their use of your personal information. Inappropriate use of personal information received from VolunteerMatch may jeopardize nonprofit membership with VolunteerMatch. VolunteerMatch reserves the right to determine, in its discretion, what constitutes inappropriate use of this information. For more about a nonprofit organization's policy, please contact them directly using the contact information posted for that organization on our site. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. We may use our e-mail lists for sending out our newsletter and other VolunteerMatch outbound communications. We do not, however, sell, rent or trade our volunteer, administrator, nonprofit, or general newsletter e-mail addresses to outside parties. 

Cookies are tiny data files that websites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them so that they can remember you when you visit. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously. Our site uses cookies to maintain a user's identity between sessions so that the site can be personalized based on user preferences or a user's history. 

We share aggregate information about our users with certain third parties. This information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and cannot be used to individually identify you. We use aggregated information we collect about users to continue to improve our service for you. 

This site contains links to other sites. VolunteerMatch is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. 

VolunteerMatch may provide volunteering services in partnership with third parties in order to provide benefits for our members, subscribers, and visitors. In connection with such services, to the extent that you have provided any personal information to us using these jointly developed services, VolunteerMatch may share e-mail addresses or other information with the applicable partner. Each of our partners has its own policies regarding the collection and use of personal information and VolunteerMatch is not responsible for their use of your information. 

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

If you are a nonprofit member, you may access all your personally identifiable information that we collect and maintain online by simply inputting your username and password in the "Post" area at http://www.volunteermatch.org. You may make any changes or correct factual errors in your administrator, organization and opportunity information 24 hours a day. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. You do not need to contact us to access your record or to make any changes. If you have problems changing your organization's information, please contact Client Relations at respond@impactonline.org. 

If you are a volunteer and would like to have your contact information deleted from the site, you may do so by contacting Client Relations at respond@impactonline.org. 

**Opting-out of communications**

Individuals who serve as administrators for their organization by registering and maintaining their organizations' information and membership, are the only group required to receive VolunteerMatch communications. All other communications are optional and allow the nonprofit organization, volunteer, subscriber or other user to unsubscribe from the newsletter. In every email we send, we provide instructions regarding how to opt-out of receiving future mailings. Users may remove their information from our database so as not to receive our service or future communications by sending an email to Client Relations at respond@impactonline.org. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
