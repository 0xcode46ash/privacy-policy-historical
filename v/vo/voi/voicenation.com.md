# VoiceNation | Privacy Policy

Protecting privacy is not a new endeavor for our company. We have a long-standing tradition of recognizing and protecting the privacy of customers who use our telecommunications networks. We maintain strict customer information privacy policies and use state of the art technologies to safeguard customer information and communications from unauthorized intrusions. 

We recognize that the growth of online services, including Internet services, has created additional privacy concerns, particularly for consumers. 

Online privacy concerns focus primarily on the protection of "customer identifiable" information which an individual or other customer reasonably expects to be kept private. As the term suggests, "customer identifiable" information is information that, when associated with an individual identifies that individual, for example, a customer's name, address, telephone number, and e-mail address. 

Some Internet users may also wish to know who can learn about what they do on the Internet, even when that online behavior is not directly linked to any information that identifies an individual. For example, advertisers may observe whether visitors to a Web site see or respond to online advertising without knowing who those visitors are. 

It is common practice and often a necessity for companies, governments, or other organizations to collect customer identifiable information in order to conduct business and offer services. For example, a telecommunications provider may collect customer identifiable information, such as name, address, telephone number, and a variety of other information in the course of billing and providing telephone service to a customer. 

Some activities on the Internet follow very familiar patterns. Consumers signing up for an Internet access service, for example, are usually asked to provide name, address, telephone number and credit card and other information that is typical when the consumer orders a product or service. Similarly, business Web sites may ask visitors to supply information about themselves, particularly when information, services or merchandise are requested, but often simply to be able to better target the company's services to the customer's interests and requirements.

### Our Online Privacy Policy: Informed Choice

We have put in place the following Online Privacy Policy. This policy covers our company and its subsidiaries. We will continue to protect customer information derived from its local, and long distance, and toll free services consistent with federal laws and with federal regulations issued by the Federal Communications Commission.

### How We Protect Your Privacy Online

Collection and Use: We will collect and use customer identifiable information for billing purposes, to provide and change service, to anticipate and resolve problems with your service, or to create and inform you of products and services that better meet your needs. This means that we may use your customer identifiable information, in conjunction with information available from other sources, to market new services to you that we think will be of interest to you, but we will not disclose your customer identifiable information to third parties who want to market products to you. 

When you access the Internet, the computers that host Web sites you visit (Web servers) automatically receive some anonymous information. This "usage data" may include a record of which pages a Web browser has visited. Our servers receive usage data when customers visit our Web sites. We may use usage data to provide advertising about goods and services that may be of interest to our customers, or to provide customized features and services. We will not use information about your activities on the Internet together with any information that identifies you without your consent. 

Our company and our advertisers may use various kinds of software devices to collect information about Internet use. Small files called "cookies" may be attached to your Web browser. These files identify your browser and save information such as passwords so that Web sites can recognize you. You can set your browser to disable cookies, but some of our Web sites (and other Web sites) may not work properly if you do this. 

Our company uses advertising companies to deliver ads on some of our Web sites. The advertising companies may also receive some anonymous information about ad viewing by Internet users on our Web sites and other Internet sites. This information may be associated with a customer's Web browser, but cannot be associated with a name or e-mail address without the customer's permission. (This means that advertising companies may know where your computer goes on the Internet, but they don't know who you are unless you tell them.) We do not supply customer identifiable information to advertising companies or to individual advertisers or other third parties. If you go to another Web site, including an advertiser's Web site (for example by clicking on an ad), and request information or enter a contest, be aware that you may be authorizing another company, including an advertising company, to use information you supply. Find out more about the advertising companies that deliver ads on our Web sites, read their privacy policies, and choose whether to let them collect information about what you do on the Internet. 

**Disclosure:  **We will not sell, trade, or disclose to third parties any customer identifiable information derived from the registration for or use of a VoiceNationSM service -- including customer names and addresses -- without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, or other legal process or in the case of imminent physical harm to the customer or others). When our company uses other agents, contractors or companies to perform services on its behalf, we will ensure that the company protects your customer identifiable information consistent with this Policy. If we include your name and any other customer identifiable information in a directory that we create from information we receive as an online service provider, the company will give you the opportunity to have your information excluded from that directory. Business directories that we create may, however, contain information obtained from other sources. 

**Customer Choice:**  A customer may choose not to receive direct marketing communications from our company in connection with our online services. Upon such choice, we (a) will not contact that customer directly with marketing messages about our online services, and (b) will not use customer identifiable information obtained from that customer's registration for or use of an online service to contact that customer with marketing messages about any VoiceNationSM products or services. A customer may choose not to receive such messages by e-mail, by mail, or by telephone. 

Customer-identifiable information which a visitor volunteers at one of the VoiceNationSM Web Sites to order VoiceNationSM) services other than online services will be protected just as if the information had been provided under more traditional ways of ordering that service. 

**Security:  **We have implemented technology and security features and strict policy guidelines to safeguard the privacy of your customer identifiable information from unauthorized access or improper use, and we will continue to enhance our security procedures as new technology becomes available. 

**E-mail Contents:**  The company will not read or disclose to third parties private e-mail communications that are transmitted using VoiceNationSM services except as required to operate the service or as otherwise authorized by law. 

**Improper Conduct:**  We may also use customer identifiable information to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the customer agreement for that service. 

**Account Information:**  Our company honors requests from customers to review all customer identifiable information maintained in reasonably retrievable form, which currently consists of your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number and/or billing information, and will correct any such information which may be inaccurate. Customers may verify that appropriate corrections have been made. 

**Customer Concerns:  **If you are a consumer with concerns about our online privacy policy or its implementation you may contact us at 1-866-766-5050. 

**Changes in Practices:**  We will keep this Policy current. The company will inform you of any changes that we make.
