Voip.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the site www.voip.com. Because this Web site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact our Privacy Team at privacy@voip.com. If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php).

Voip.com will not trade, sell, disclose, or otherwise provide to any third party any form of customer identifiable information without the consent of the customer (except as required by subpoena, search warrant, legal process, or when compelled by a lawful body). This includes information obtained from order forms, customer subscription, and from the utilization of the voip.com service. 

## Collection / Use of Information

Voip.com collects and uses customer identifiable information for billing, provisioning of service, troubleshoot service errors, and to inform customers of changes to the voip.com service. Voip.com uses third parties, such as VISA, MasterCard, and American Express, to process payment information (if necessary). We will only disclose information necessary to complete a transaction. Voip.com prohibits any third party from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, or deactivate it by making the change on our member information page.
