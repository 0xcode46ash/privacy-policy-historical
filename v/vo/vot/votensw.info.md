**Clickstream data and cookies**

When visiting this website the site server makes a record of the visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes:

  * The user’s server address – this allows us to consider the visitors who use the site most, and tailor the site to their interests and needs;

  * The user’s operating system (for example Windows, Mac etc.) – this allows us to tailor browser or platform specific parts of the site to each operating system because browsers act differently on each platform;

  * The user’s top level domain name (for example, .com, .gov, .au etc.) – this can allow us to tailor information relevant to different domains;

  * The date and time of the visit to the site – this is important for identifying the website’s busy times and ensuring maintenance on the site is conducted outside these periods;

  * Pages accessed and documents downloaded – this indicates to us which pages or documents are most important to our users and also helps identify important information that may be difficult to find;

  * Duration of the visit – this indicates to us how interesting and informative our site is to our users;

  * Geographic location – this shows us how well marketed our site is internationally;

  * The site visited before our website – this helps us determine the interests of our users and which sites are providing links to ours as well as sites where we may be able to seek links;

  * The type of browser used – this is important for browser specific coding e.g. Javascript.  





No attempt will be made to identify users or their browsing activities unless legally compelled to do so, such as in the event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect the Internet Service Provider’s log files.

This site contains links to other sites. This Office is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. This Office has no knowledge if cookies or other tracking devices are used on linked websites.
