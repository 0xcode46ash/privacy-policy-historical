# Lastest from VoxOx

TelCentris, Inc. is committed to building a trusted relationship with our users. 

This privacy policy (this “Policy”) covers how we treat the personal information that we collect and receive when you register for and use “VoxOx” software and services (“VoxOx”). This Policy explains the practices that apply to the collection and use of your personal information.

  
Collection of Your Personal Information 

Registration data 

In order to provide VoxOx, we must collect your personal phone number so that we can identify you when you interact with our system, and to route communications from other users to your phone. We collect your phone number from you: 

• When you enter your phone number in the VoxOx browser for registration or the VoxOx Web Portal  
• When you make a call using your phone number thru the TelCentris, Inc. network 

When you call a phone number, we collect your personal phone number using caller ID to identify you. If you are a registered user, the phone number at which you receive calls is verified with the phone number you entered during registration to ensure that the person providing the phone number is in possession of said phone. Verification of your phone enables other people to call you. 

We may also collect your e-mail address in order to provide certain services to you. 

We collect your e-mail address from you: 

• When you enter your e-mail in the VoxOx browser for registration or the VoxOx Web Portal  
• When another user enters your email into our website 

Verification of your email also allows you to receive voicemail messages and faxes from other users attempting to contact you. 

As part of the registration process, you may be asked to create a username and password to be associated with your persona for security. We may also collect your name, country, or time zone to enhance security/facilitate Services. 

Automatic Tracking 

By using our website, we are able to and may track certain non-personally-identifiable information about you and your correspondence with any TelCentris, Inc. site including but not limited to VoxOx in order to perform internal research on our users’ demographics, interests and behavior, as well as to monitor and enforce the terms of the Terms of Service Agreement. This information may include the URL from which you arrived, your click path within the specific TelCentris, Inc. site, the next URL you may visit, what browser you are using and your IP address. 

We may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to enhance and personalize your experience with VoxOx. This includes helping authenticate your identity when you log in to VoxOx; remembering your preferences and registration information; and measuring and researching the effectiveness of any VoxOx services and promotions. 

Invitations and Other Communications to Non-members 

VoxOx subscribers can invite other people to join the service by sending invitation emails and instant messages via our automated invitation system. TelCentris, Inc. does not sell these email addresses or use them to send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Recipients of invitations from VoxOx subscribers may contact TelCentris, Inc. (see below for contact details) to request the removal of their information from our database. 

How Your Personal Information Is Used

our Personal Information is used to operate the service features and offerings, to personalize the services provided to you, and to communicate with you and respond to your inquiries. 

Personal information submitted by users of VoxOx will be displayed to their VoxOx contacts, as well as other contacts who belong to the networks with which you allow access of your personal information. 

Your Personal Information will not be shared with any commercially-interested third parties except to provide the services you've requested. In order to provide the services you’ve requested, we've carefully choose partners to work with. These partners are technology providers of telecom services, which are an ingredient in TelCentris, Inc. services. These partners are required to protect your information in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy and do not have any independent right to share your VoxOx Information. We may use non-identifying information to better design our services. TelCentris, Inc. works with third party advertiser/cookies that may use information about your visit to the VoxOx browser and web portal to provide them with ads. 

We have a good faith belief that TelCentris, Inc. is not being used for illegal activity. In the event legal authorities deem it necessary to investigate a TelCentris, Inc. user’s activity, by way of legal processes (court order, search warrant or subpoena), we will oblige as required by law. 

Disclosure of Personal Information in the Event of a Merger or Sale of TelCentris, Inc. 

TelCentris, Inc. may merge or be acquired by another business entity or may sell all or substantially all of its assets to an acquirer. In the event of such merger, acquisition or sale, TelCentris, Inc. may share some or all of your personally identifiable information with the acquiring company in order to continue serving you and others and continuing to offer you the Services. 

Co-branded and Other Affiliated Sites 

Certain information or services offered or provided through VoxOx, from time to time, may be provided on or through other websites operated by or in conjunction with third party providers ("Partners"). Although TelCentris, Inc. will continue to control any personally identifiable information collected about you from one of these sites, such information may be shared by TelCentris, Inc. with that Partner in order to further facilitate the Services to which you register. However, a Partner will not rent, sell, or disclose any of your personally identifiable information to third parties unless you consent to such disclosures and use in advance (for example, you may be asked to opt-in on a particular co-branded site in order to receive information or offers from a Partner, its affiliates or agents).
