Last Updated: July 11, 2011

Voxy, (“Voxy” or “we” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We created this Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy as you visit the [www.voxy.com](http://www.voxy.com/) website (the “Site”) and use the services available on, through or in connection with the Site, including via mobile application (the “Services”). Your use of the Site and the Services is governed by this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Use](http://voxy.com/terms/en/), which are expressly incorporated herein.

## 1\. The Privacy Policy, Site & Services

This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Site and the Services and not to any other websites or services that you may be able to access from the Site or through the Services, including but not limited to via an advertisement or content link, each of which may have data collection, storage and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy. Some of the Services are accessible without registering with us, but to actively engage with the Voxy, you must register as a member.  If you use our Site or Services without registering, the only information we collect will be non-personal information through the use of “cookies” or “web beacons” (please see Section 2).  If you choose to register with us, we require you to submit certain information personally identifying you, which may include your first and last name, e-mail address, mobile telephone number, and/or billing information, as applicable (collectively, “Personal Information”).  You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Information you submit to Voxy. Inaccurate information will affect your use of the Site and Services and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy.

Even if you do not register with Voxy, we collect information other than Personal Information (“Non-Personal Information”) about your use of our Site and Services.

**A. Cookies**

We use “cookies” to customize your experience with the Site and Services and to store your Credentials so you do not have to re-enter them each time you visit the Site or access the Services.  Cookies are small computer files that are transferred to your hard drive and contain information such as your username, user preferences, the web pages you’ve visited and the activities you’ve performed while using the Site and Services. We do not link the information stored in cookies to any of your Personal Information.  You may block or delete cookies from your hard drive; however, by disabling cookies, you may not have access to all of the Services.  Some of our business partners also use cookies to provide us with anonymous, aggregate data and information regarding our users. We do not have access or control over these cookies, and our Privacy Policy does not cover the use of third party cookies.

**B. Web Beacons**

We or our third party tracking utility company also use “web beacons” to collect anonymous information about your use of our Site, the websites of selected sponsors and advertisers, and our Services. Web beacons are tiny graphic image files embedded in a web page or email that provide a presence on the web page or email and send back to its home server information from the user’s browser. The information collected by web beacons allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Site and Services, selected sponsors' and advertisers' websites and using our Services and for what purposes. We do not link Non-Personal Information from web beacons to Personal Information.

We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Site or use our Services: (1) Internet Protocol (“IP”) addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers and/or mobile devices accessing the Site or Services; (4) types of web or mobile browsers used to access the Site or Services; (5) referring source which may have sent you to the Site or Service; and (6) other information associated with the interaction of your browser and the Site or Services (collectively “Traffic Data”). We do not link Non-Personal Information from Traffic Data to Personal Information.

We may use your Traffic Data to customize and tailor your experience with the Site and Services, in communications, to display content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences.

We may share your Personal Information and Traffic Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services related to our operation of the Site and Services and/or by making certain Services available to our users (such as website and mobile platform hosting, data storage, payment processing and security).

## 5\. Information Collected By Third Parties

Certain Site content and Services may be served on websites or mobile platforms hosted and operated by a company other than Voxy (“Third Party Contractors”). Voxy does not disclose your Personal Information to these Third Party Contractors without your consent, but you should be aware that any information you independently disclose to a Third Party Contractor is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Voxy does not endorse and is not responsible for the privacy practices of these Third Party Contractors and you should review the privacy policy of any Third Party Contractor to which you volunteer information to understand how that Third Party Contractor collects and uses your personally identifiable information.
