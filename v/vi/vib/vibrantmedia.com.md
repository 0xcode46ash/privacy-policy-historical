**Collection and use of information on the Website**

_Personally Identifiable Information_

This Website is directed to our Clients and prospective Clients, who are businesses. The Website is not directed to consumers. We collect Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) via this Website. PII is information that may be used to identify a particular person or entity, and includes, by way of example, name, postal address, email address and telephone number. Generally speaking, we only collect PII on the Website when you choose to provide it to us and use that information for the purposes that you’ve provided it. The following are some specific use cases: 

  * _Vibrant Media’s Inquiry Form_ \- The Vibrant Media Website contains an “inquiry form” for Clients and prospective Clients to request additional information about Vibrant Media’s products and services. The inquiry form requires web publishers to give contact information (such as name and email address.) Vibrant Media uses this information to contact such Clients and prospective Clients about the services on the Website in which they have expressed interest, and to help us provide excellent customer service to our Clients. 
  * _Client Contracts_ – We generally require both our advertising and web publisher Clients to provide PII as part of their Client registration process. We generally use this information to contact the Client if there’s billing or order processing issue, and to help us process invoices. 
  * _Testimonials_ \- Some of our Clients agree to allow us to use their name and comments on the Website as part of testimonials. If you’ve agreed to have your name appear in a testimonial on this Website, you should be aware that any PII displayed there can be read, collected, or used by other users of this Website.

**Collection and use of Information via our Technology**

_Overview of the Technology_

Our Technology is primarily designed to facilitate the delivery of online advertisements. The Technology highlights certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites. And when a user scrolls over those words or phrases, our Technology displays ads. For a complete description of how our Technology works, please [click here](http://www.vibrantmedia.com/about/index.asp). 

Vibrant aims to deliver advertisements that align with your current interests called "Interest Matching". Our Technology identifies your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online, along with the advertisements that you have viewed and clicked on. There is no PII transmitted or used whatsoever. The goal is simply to deliver advertisements that are more relevant, interesting and useful for you. You may encounter our Technology: when our text based advertising solution is enabled on the website of one of our Clients; when Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients purchases online advertisements on a website that you visit; and/or when one of our Clients places one of our web beacons on its website, which you visit. 

We use the information collected by our Technology in order to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, and for ad delivery and reporting purposes.

**Types of information we collect via our Technology**

**Information Security**

The security of your information is important to us, including but not limited to the PII collected via the Website. We have implemented reasonable security measures to protect the information in our care, both during transmission and once we receive it. This includes, but is not limited to the use of firewalls and encryption. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

We generally do not rent or share information collected via the Website or Technology with non-affiliated third parties without your consent. We may, however, share such information with trusted third party contractors who provide services for us. These third party contractors are prohibited from using the information we provide for purposes other than performing services for us. 

We may share Non-PII collected on the Website or via our Technology with unaffiliated third parties. For example, we may disclose that ‘blue banner ads’ receive more clicks than ‘orange banner ads.’ This information cannot be used to contact or identify any person individually. 

We may disclose your information to third parties when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Vibrant Media may also disclose user information when necessary to comply with a court order, legal process or other legal proceeding.

Finally, we may transfer information, including any PII, to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
