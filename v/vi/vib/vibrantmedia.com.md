### 2\. Collection and Use of Information through Our Technology

_Overview of the Technology._ Our Clients may use our Technology to deliver advertisements that are intended to align with your current interests. This form of advertising, called "Interest Matching", delivers advertisements that are more relevant, interesting, and useful for you. Our Clients may also use our Technology for other purposes including to help measure the effectiveness of a campaign or to optimize other campaigns. 

Our Technology is designed to facilitate the delivery of contextual advertisements by highlighting certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites. It works like this: when a user scrolls over those words or phrases, our Technology then displays ads that are relevant to the highlighted text. We may use our Technology to identify your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online, along with the advertisements that you have viewed and clicked on. We may use this information collected by our Technology to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, for ad delivery and reporting, and other purposes. There is no PII transmitted or used in this process. For a detailed description of how our Technology targets contextual advertisements relevant to you, [please click here](https://web.archive.org/advertisers/index.asp "Vibrant Contextual Platform"). 

You may encounter our Technology when you visit a web site: (1) where one of our Clients has enabled our text-based advertising solution; (2) where Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients, purchases online advertisements; and/or (3) where one of our Clients places a web beacon.

_Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ We may collect Non-PII via our Technology using cookies for many purposes including to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, measure the effectiveness of a campaign, optimize a campaign, or for operational purposes.

We may also collect and maintain via cookies other Non-PII to create a data set of keyword interactions, also to assist us in showing you more relevant advertisements and help manage our advertising campaigns. This data set may include a list of search terms that you use to arrive on our Client’s website, keywords recently viewed by you, the time and date you clicked on or viewed one of our Client’s advertisements, and the web pages you viewed after you clicked on or viewed one of our Client’s advertisements. You may “opt out” of certain practices as explained below.

_Storage of Non-Personally Identifiable Information._ We retain the Non-PII collected via our Technology for up to 13 months.

Finally, we may transfer Information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or other corporate change.
