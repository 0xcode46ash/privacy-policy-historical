### 2\. Collection and Use of Information through Our Technology

_Overview of the Technology._ Our Clients may use our Technology to deliver advertisements that are intended to align with your current interests. This form of advertising, called "Interest Matching", delivers advertisements that are more relevant, interesting, and useful for you. Our Clients may also use our Technology for other purposes including to help measure the effectiveness of a campaign or to optimize other campaigns. 

Our Technology is designed to facilitate the delivery of contextual advertisements by highlighting certain words or phrases on our Client’s websites. It works like this: when a user scrolls over those words or phrases, our Technology then displays ads that are relevant to the highlighted text. We may use our Technology to identify your interests by the words that you have recently seen and read while online and by the websites visited, along with the advertisements that you have viewed and clicked on. We may use this information collected by our Technology to help make the online advertisements you see more relevant to you, for ad delivery and reporting, and other purposes. There is no PII transmitted or used in this process. You may encounter our Technology when you visit a web site: (1) where one of our Clients has enabled our text-based advertising solution; (2) where Vibrant Media, or one of our Clients, purchases online advertisements; and/or (3) where one of our Clients places a web beacon.

We may use non-PII and information provided by other entities to help make our client's advertising more relevant. Some of these entities participate in self-regulatory programs including the Digital Advertising Alliance's ("DAA") program. To learn about the DAA program as well as exercise choice with respect to those entities participating in the DAA program, [click here](http://www.aboutads.info/ "About Ads").
