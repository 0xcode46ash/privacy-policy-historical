# Privacy Policy

Villanova University is concerned about your privacy. The following privacy policy explains the information we collect when you visit this site and how we use this information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully so you understand our privacy practices.

#### Information Villanova Collects

Villanova collects two kinds of information on this site: information that is voluntarily supplied by visiting the site and enrolling in programs and information that is automatically collected as you navigate this site.

This site automatically records certain non-personal information, including the name of the domain and host from which you access the Web. For example, aol.com or villanova.edu; the Internet Protocol (IP) address of the computer you are using; the browser used and the operating system; the date and time you access this site; and the Internet address of the web site linked directly to this site. We may also collect tracking information through the use of cookies, which place certain information on your computer to facilitate your future access.

This site also includes links to other websites hosted by third parties. When you access any such website from this site, any information you provide will be governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting.

#### How Villanova Uses This Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may provide aggregated statistical data to reputable third-party vendors, but this data will include no personally identifying information. We may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonable necessary to (i) enforce law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Villanova University, our users, or others.

#### Sharing of Information

Villanova University does, upon explicit request of users, share information with other parties and gather information from other private data providers. For example, the University receives test scores from testing agencies and will send transcripts to other schools. This is done only at the request of users (persons to whom the information applies). It is against University policy to release confidential information gathered through the Web.

#### How Villanova Protects Your Information

When you access your personal information, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. As effective as encryption technology is, however, no security system is completely impenetrable, so we cannot guarantee absolute security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won’t be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

#### E-Commerce

Several sites within Villanova University enable you to pay for products or services online with a credit card. Unless otherwise noted these transactions are encrypted. It is University policy that confidential information you enter in the transaction is used only for the purposes described in that transaction, unless an additional use is specifically stated on that site.

#### Public Forums

Villanova University makes forums, message boards, and news groups available to its users. The University does not ordinarily log public chat sessions, however, any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should therefore exercise caution when deciding to disclose your confidential information in such places.

#### Online Surveys

At any time there are online surveys being conducted on the University’s web site. It is University policy that confidential information gathered in these online surveys is used only for the research purposes indicated in the survey. Unless otherwise noted on the specified survey, your answers are confidential and individual responses will not be shared with other parties. Aggregate data from surveys may be shared with external third parties.
