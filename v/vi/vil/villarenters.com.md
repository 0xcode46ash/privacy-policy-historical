# Privacy statement

In order to process your booking we need to collect certain personal details from you. These details will include, where applicable, the names of party members, at least the party leader’s contact details (including email address), at least the party leader’s credit/debit card details, etc which we do not store. If we need further details we will ask you for these. We will use the contact details you have given us to correspond with you in relation to your booking or enquiry. We will also need to pass your details to the third parties who need to know them so that your chosen accommodation can be provided or your enquiry can be dealt with. The owner of the accommodation you have booked or enquired about may contact you direct using the details you have given us. Your details may be passed to third parties in countries outside of the European Economic Area if necessary in order to arrange for your booking to be provided or enquiry answered. These countries may not provide the same level of protection for your personal data as the UK. By submitting your booking or your enquiry to us, you agree to your personal details being processed in this way.

If you have subscribed to our e-mail service or have made a booking for, or an enquiry about, the services we offer, we may send you very occasional and targeted promotional e-mails about the services and special deals we offer unless you have opted out of receiving these.

We may need to disclose our customer database, including any personal data relating to you contained therein, to a third party who acquires or attempts to acquire all or substantially all of the assets or stocks in our company or our website whether by merger, acquisition, reorganisation or otherwise.

Except where expressly permitted by the Data Protection Act, we will only deal with the personal details you give us as set out above unless you agree or tell us otherwise. We have appropriate security measures in place to protect this information.

You are generally entitled to ask us (by letter or e-mail) what details of yours are being held or processed, for what purpose and to whom they may be or have been disclosed. We will charge a fee to respond to such a request. We promise to respond to your request within 40 days of receiving your written request and fee. In certain limited circumstances we are entitled to refuse your request.

If you believe that any of your personal details which we are processing are inaccurate or incorrect please contact us immediately.

This privacy statement covers websites owned and controlled by us only. Links to other websites and any information collected by these sites are not covered by this privacy statement. As our privacy statement may change due to developments in the law, we would encourage you to reread our privacy statement from time to time so that you are aware of any changes in how we gather and use personal information.

Our website uses cookies. A ‘cookie’ is information that a website stores on your computer so that it can remember something about you at a later time. The purpose of cookie is to identify users and to personalise their visit by customising a web page for their use.
