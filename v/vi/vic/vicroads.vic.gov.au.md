  * **Click stream data**

When you visit our on-line services, VicRoads makes a record of your visit. The following information, referred to as 'click stream data' in computer language, is logged by our server:   


  * your server address;   

  * your top level domain name (for example, .com, .gov, .au, .uk, etc);   

  * the date and time you visited our website or completed the on-line transaction;   

  * the pages you accessed and documents you downloaded;   

  * the type of browser you are using; and   

  * the address of the referring site (that is, the previous site you visited).  


All of this information is collected for statistical purposes to enable us to assess the number of visitors to the different sections of our site, determine what information is most and least used and help us make our site more useful to visitors. We do not actively seek to identify you. However, in the unlikely event of an investigation, a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect our server's logs.  


  * **Use of Cookies**

When you visit our site, our server may generate a cookie. A cookie is a small piece of information (a text file) that a web server can place temporarily on your hard drive or web browser. It is used by your browser to identify the pages that you have visited on our site.   
A cookie is uniquely yours and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.   


  * **Why are Cookies used?**

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and usability of our sites. We do not use cookies to collect personal information. Cookies, alone, do not reveal your e-mail address or other personal information. You choose to provide this information by, for example, registering at our site.

The type of information collected might include the Internet Protocol address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the web beacon was viewed and for how long, the type of browser that retrieved the image and previously set cookie values.

_Web beacons are also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs._
