# Victorian State Government Privacy

The State Government and its service providers value the privacy of every individual’s personal information and health information. 

The State Government is committed to protecting the information it collects and uses by compliance with its obligations under the Information Privacy Act 2000 and the Health Records Act 2001.

Protecting your privacy and your personal and health information is an important aspect of the way we create, organise and implement our activities on-line and off-line.

You can access our website home page and browse our site without disclosing personal information. The State Government will only record an individual's E-mail address and/or contact details if they send our site a message. The information an individual provides is collected for the purposes of responding to the matters raised in an individual’s electronic correspondence.

We will only collect personal and health information that is necessary to perform these functions. We will only use personal and health information provided for the purposes for which it was collected.

We will ensure that your personal and health information will not be disclosed to other State institutions and authorities except if required by law or other regulation.

When you provide the State Government with personal and health information about other individuals, the State Government relies on you to make them aware that such information will or may be provided to the State Government, the types of third parties the State Government may provide it to, the relevant purposes that the State Government and such third parties will use it for, and how they can access it. 

We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal and health information that we have under our control from unauthorised access, improper use, alteration, unlawful or accidental destruction and accidental loss.

We will remove personal and health information where it is no longer required (except where archiving is required and in compliance with the Public Records Act 1973). We will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal and health information is accurate, complete and up to date whenever the State Government collects, discloses or uses it.

Please note:  
This privacy statement does not extend beyond this website. When linking to other sites from this website, we recommend that you read the privacy statement of that site to familiarise yourself with its privacy principles.
