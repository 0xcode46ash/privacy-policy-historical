# Privacy Policy

## Management of users' personal information

When registering a personal profile on the Victoria Milan® website you are asked to provide certain information like a screen name (username) of your own choosing, an email address, date of birth etc. We encourage all persons who sign up to choose a screen name that can never be traced to their real identity as well as an anonymous email account that is created for Victoria Milan® solely to ensure your full confidentiality. It is also very important to choose a password that you have never used before and we encourage you to frequently change it to maintain the confidentiality of the information you provide.

The email address you provide during account registration at Victoria Milan® will never be visible or otherwise available to other users. We still encourage all our members and users to create an anonymous separate email account at an email provider like Hotmail, Yahoo, AOL or similar. This will also secure your emails from being read by other members of family or friends by accident. The only exception is if we are imposed by a local court, or other legal authority. Safety is also ensured having chosen one of Europe's most serious and most secure suppliers of server services to host our websites.

If you choose to upload an image to your profile there is a risk of being recognized and linked to your real identity. We therefore advise you to use photos that do not show your face fully or use our unique AnonymousBlur™ feature to make your face unrecognizable on the photos you choose to upload. This will ensure your anonymous identity while at the same time allowing other users to get a certain impression of your appearance.

Please note that we do not accept any liability or responsibility for any damage or loss you may suffer as a result of not following the guidelines provided in this Privacy Policy or our terms of agreement.

Victoria Milan® is in no way involved in activities that involve the sale, redistribution or other unauthorized use of your personal information.

All processing of personal information will follow the provisions of applicable data protection legislation and regulation. You have the right to information about the information we store about you and request that faulty information is corrected. Contact us if you have any questions or concerns about your personal information.

In spite of the fact that we try to comply with the highest standards regarding the protection of any (personal and/ or private) information and abuse by others according to the applicable legislation we decline every responsibility and/or liability in the event of unauthorized use and/or loss of information.
