# Viator | Tours, Tickets & Things to do from Tour Operators Worldwide by Viator

## The Viator Privacy Policy

At Viator, we recognize that earning and retaining your trust is one of the most important things we do as a business. Protecting your privacy is a responsibility we take very seriously.

We have prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand how Viator collects, uses and safeguards the personal information you provide to us on our websites, via email, and through our service providers and distribution partners.

Rest assured that, unless you explicitly give us consent to do otherwise, Viator will only collect and use your personal information as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

### Who We Are

Viator operates through different websites around the world, which are all part of the Viator family.

  * **Viator.com** is our flagship website, where we offer our complete range of products and services directly to consumers.
  * At Viator we also work with hundreds of **affiliate partners** ([click here](http://www.viator.com/partnership#distribution) to view a partial list of Viator affiliates) who distribute our products and services to consumers through their individual websites. We typically host our affiliates’ product-information and booking pages, and manage payment and credit card information.
  * We also work with **distributors** (as discussed below) who manage the hosting, purchase and payment for our products and services.



### What Information Do We Collect?

When you visit Viator.com or any of our affiliates’ web pages that are hosted by us, our web server automatically recognizes and collects your IP address.

In order to purchase our products or services, it is necessary for you to disclose personal information, including your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card details and other identifying information in order to process orders and provide customer service. If you do not provide personal information when purchasing one of our products or services, we cannot confirm your purchase or fulfill your booking.

If you subscribe to any of our newsletters, it is necessary to disclose your name and email address.

In some instances we may also ask for personal demographic data such as your country of residence, gender, age, travel habits, etc.

We also use cookies (as discussed below) to collect information about the performance and usability of our websites.

### Cookies, and How We Use Them

"Cookies" are pieces of information that are stored by your web browser on your computer's hard disk, for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves only identify your computer; they do not personally identify you.

At Viator we make limited use of cookies to store your preferences, record session information, collect information on how you visit and access our websites, and to tailor our web pages to your needs.

We do **not** use cookies to identify specific users for marketing purposes. We do not match cookies to your purchase information. And we do not use cookies to track your movements after leaving our websites. Most web browsers allow you to turn off cookies; however, turning off cookies will limit your use of our websites.

### How We Use Your Personal Information

We use your personal information in the following ways:

  * To provide you with the information you request about our products
  * To send you email updates, newsletters and information for which you have specifically subscribed
  * To fulfill your bookings
  * To confirm your purchases
  * To ensure you are correctly billed
  * To measure and track demographic details about our customers



If you make a purchase at one of our websites, we may also send you information about new products, or ask your opinion about our websites, etc., so that we may improve our service to you and other consumers. If you do not want Viator to contact you in the future, please let us know by sending an email to our Privacy Officer at [privacy@viator.com](mailto:privacy@viator.com).

If you subscribe to any of our newsletters, we will use your personal information to send you the information you requested. You will always have the option to unsubscribe.

Some of the personal information we collect is shared with our service partners (e.g. tour operators) who are directly involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us.

We only provide our service providers with your name and your local contact details, if you provide them (e.g. your hotel name for pick-ups and drop-offs, your local phone number, etc.) We do not provide our service providers with any other personal information. If you decide to provide any personal information directly to a service provider, we recommend that you review the service provider’s privacy policy.

We also share your personal information with third parties contracted to provide us with marketing and data reporting services who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.

We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this website. The information we collect helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our website on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can “opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by [clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/privacy/product#optout).

Finally, rest assured that we do not share your personal information with third-party organizations who are not involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us or who are not contracted by us. We also do not partner with or have relationships with any businesses which serve ads on websites and collect information about your use of web sites.

### Our Distribution Partners

Our products are made available through our distribution partners. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with the privacy policies of our distribution partners, which may differ from Viator's Privacy Policy.

### Our Security and Storage Measures

At Viator we are committed to maintaining the integrity and security of your personal information.

We use industry-standard encryption protocols when receiving and transferring your personal information. In fact, when you send personal information to us over the Internet, we first require that a "secure session" be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

Your personal information is stored in secure operating environments that are not accessible to the general public. We have security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information by our employees or third parties.

However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times. Viator will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorized access to your personal information.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We know that our business will continue to evolve as we introduce new products and as such from time to time our Privacy Policy may be reviewed and revised.

Viator reserves the right to change its Privacy Policy and post the changes on its website. We will only use your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Policy in effect at the time we collected your personal information.

### Contacting Us

For some Viator services you can access and update your registration and personal information online.

To correct or update any other personal information, or if you have questions about Viator’s Privacy Policy, please email our Privacy Officer at [privacy@viator.com](mailto:privacy@viator.com).

### Further Information About Privacy Laws

There is no single global entity that regulates personal information online. Instead, Viator has made a conscious choice to follow the privacy guidelines as defined in the major markers where we operate. In Australia that means being guided by the [Australian National Privacy Principles](http://www.privacy.gov.au/publications/nppgl_01.html). In the United States that means adhering to the [Federal Trade Commission’s](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/) privacy guidelines. In Europe the regulations are based on [EC Directive 95/46/EC](http://www.cdt.org/privacy/eudirective/EU_Directive_.html).
