## The Viator Privacy Policy

At Viator, we recognize that earning and retaining your trust is one of the most important things we do as a business. Protecting your privacy is a responsibility we take very seriously.

We have prepared this Privacy Policy to help you understand how Viator collects, uses and seeks to safeguard the Personal Information (as defined below) you provide to us on our websites, via email, and through our service providers and distribution partners. This Privacy Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information or other practices of any third party, including any third-party distribution partners, suppliers and tour operators, and any third party operating any site to which our websites contain a link. By downloading, accessing or using our websites, or providing information to us in connection with our websites, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy.

### Who We Are

Viator operates through different websites around the world, which are all part of the Viator family.

  * **Viator.com** is our flagship website, where we offer our complete range of products and services directly to consumers.
  * At Viator we also work with hundreds of **affiliate partners** ([click here](http://www.viator.com/partnership#distribution) to view a partial list of Viator affiliates) who distribute our products and services to consumers through their individual websites. We typically host our affiliates' product-information and booking pages, and manage payment and credit card information.
  * We also work with **distributors** (as discussed below) who manage the hosting, purchase and payment for our products and services.



### What Information Do We Collect?

We collect two types of information from you on our websites, via email, and through our service providers and distribution partners. Personal Information is information that identifies you personally, such as your name and email address. We also collect Other Information that does not identify you personally, such as gender, country of residence and other demographic information.

In order to purchase our products or services, it is necessary for you to disclose Personal Information, including your name, address, email address, phone number, credit card details and other personally identifying information. If you do not provide Personal Information when purchasing one of our products or services, we cannot confirm your purchase or fulfill your booking.

When you register with Viator, we ask for basic information including your name and email address, and Other Information such as your signup location. If you connect to Viator using Facebook, we may also collect information that you have chosen to make available in your Facebook privacy settings, including Personal Information such as your Facebook email address and Facebook username, Other Information such as your profile picture and friend lists, and any other Personal or Other Information you have chosen to make available.

When you visit Viator.com or any of our affiliates' web pages that are hosted by us, our web server automatically recognizes and collects your IP address, which is assigned by your Internet Service Provider and does not identify you personally. To help us analyze the usage of our websites and related services, and to send more relevant communications to you, we also collect and keep track of Other Information such as your website searches and bookings. For example, if you frequently visit Paris and London, we may send you special notices listing deals and popular products for those destinations. If you are subscribed to any of our email marketing communications - including newsletters and destination alerts, it is necessary for you to disclose Personal Information such as your name and email address and Other Information such as your home country.

In some instances we may also ask for Other Information such as demographic data, including your country of residence, gender, age, travel habits, etc. We also use cookies (as discussed below) to collect information about the performance and usability of our websites.

You can contribute to the site in a number of different ways, including writing reviews, uploading photos, filling out your public profile, and rating other users' contributions. We may store these contributions (your "Content"), display them to other users, and use them for promotional purposes. Note that if you include Personal Information in your Content, it can be used and viewed by others. We are not responsible for the information you choose to include in your Content.

We will provide you with choices regarding the use and disclosure of your Personal Information for marketing purposes.

If you connect to Viator using Facebook, we may show you reviews, photos and tours that your Facebook friends have posted, shared, saved or purchased on Viator. Note that, if you have Facebook friends who are using Viator, they may also share information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, please review your Facebook privacy settings.

You can also choose to access third-party social media websites and services through Viator (such as Facebook and Twitter). When you do so, you are sharing information with those sites, and the information you share is governed by their privacy policies.

Some of the Personal Information we collect is shared with our service partners (e.g. tour operators) who are directly involved in fulfilling the purchases you have made from us. We only provide our service providers with your name and your local contact details, if you provide them (e.g., your hotel name for pick-ups and drop-offs, your local phone number, your mobile phone number, your email address, etc.) We do not provide our service providers with any other Personal Information. If you decide to provide any Personal Information directly to a service provider, we recommend that you review the service provider's privacy policy to determine how such service provider may use or disclose your Personal Information.

We also share your Personal Information with third parties contracted to provide us with marketing and data reporting services who are bound by an obligation of confidentiality and with other third-party marketing partners.

We currently contract with several third-party online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of third-party marketing companies to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our website. To do this, we use web beacons and cookies provided by such marketing companies in connection with our websites. The information we collect helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. If you do not want to help us learn how to improve our site, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyze such data by [clicking here](http://www.omniture.com/en/privacy/product#optout "clicking here").

We may also use or disclose Personal Information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public or government authorities, including public or government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our terms and conditions; (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, or that of our affiliates, you or others; or (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain.

We may use and disclose Other Information for any purpose. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information (such as combining your name with your geographical location). If we combine any Other Information with Personal Information, the combined information will be treated by us as Personal Information, as long as it is so combined.

### Email Communications You Can Expect to Receive from Viator

We may send to you marketing emails with information about Viator deals, destination and product news, sweepstakes, programs, etc., and other special promotions that we believe that you will find valuable, interesting or informative. We will provide you with choices regarding our use of your Personal Information for marketing purposes. If you are no longer interested in receiving future email marketing communications from Viator, you have several choices for opting out of future mailings:

  * You may unsubscribe at any time by following the directions and link included in each email marketing message we send.
  * When you register as a Viator.com member, you may click on "My Account" at the top of any page of our website and update your "Account Settings"
  * You may email [privacy@viator.com](mailto:privacy@viator.com) and request to be unsubscribed by including your name, email address, and the words "unsubscribe" in the subject or message body.



Please note that, even if you opt-out of receiving future marketing communications from Viator, we will continue to send to you emails regarding your purchases and bookings, and regarding administrative information such as changes to our terms, conditions and policies. If you make a booking or purchase at one of our websites, we may also send you information about new products, or ask your opinion about our websites, etc., so that we may improve our service to you and other consumers.

### Our Distribution Partners and Suppliers

Our products are made available through our third-party distribution partners and suppliers. Our distribution partners and suppliers may have privacy policies that differ from Viator's Privacy Policy.

You should also be aware that some product or tour suppliers and some of our distribution partners may need additional Personal or Other Information (such as health or physical fitness information) to determine whether you can participate in an activity. You should read and rely upon the relevant supplier's or partner's Privacy Policy only (and not Viator's Privacy Policy), if Viator does not collect this information from you directly.

Some suppliers or distribution partners may operate in countries or states that do not have laws or regulations for the protection and safeguarding of Personal Information. Viator seeks to take reasonable steps to persuade all its suppliers and distribution partners to adopt and adhere to privacy policies that are substantially similar to this one. However, please be aware that Viator is not in a position to force adherence, so we will rely on you and our other Customers to inform us if your privacy is not being adequately protected by our suppliers or distribution partners. Viator may then seek to take steps (including severing its relationship with offending suppliers or distribution partners) to help prevent other occurrences.

### Our Security and Storage Measures

At Viator we seek to maintain the integrity and security of your Personal Information.

We use industry-standard encryption protocols when receiving and transferring your Personal Information. In fact, when you send Personal Information to us over the Internet, we first require that a "secure session" be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).

We seek to store your Personal Information in secure operating environments that are not accessible to the general public, and to have security measures in place at our physical facilities to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of your Personal Information by our employees or third parties.

However, no data transmission over the Internet or data storage environment can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times. Viator will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorized access to your Personal Information. Viator will rely on you telling us if you experience any unusual events that may indicate a breach in your information security. We will then seek to investigate whether the security breach was related to the data transmissions from or to Viator and let you know what steps can be taken and have been taken to help rectify the problem. Further action, such as reporting incidents to the police or other proper authorities, may also be required.

### Changes to Our Privacy Policy

We know that our business will continue to evolve as we introduce new products, and, as such, from time to time this Privacy Policy may be reviewed and revised.

Viator reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy by posting the changes on its website. You can determine when this Privacy Policy was last updated by reviewing the " _LAST UPDATED_ " legend below.

### Contacting Us

For some Viator services you can access and update your registration and Personal Information online.

To correct or update any other Personal Information, or if you have questions about Viator's Privacy Policy, please email our Privacy Officer at [privacy@viator.com](mailto:privacy@viator.com).
