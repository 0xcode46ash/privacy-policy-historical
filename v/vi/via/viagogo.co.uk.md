## Automatic Logging of Session Data

Generic information about your computer's connection to the Internet, called "session data", will automatically be logged. This information is anonymous and can not be used to track your personal information. Session data consists of things such as IP address, operating system and type of browser software being used and the activities conducted by the user while on our site. An IP address is a number that enables computers attached to the Internet, such as our web servers, to know where to send data back to the user, such as the pages of the site the user wishes to view. We collect session data because it helps us administer our web site, track correlative information and to collate statistics in relation to visitor traffic. We may use your IP address to help us diagnose problems with our server. Rest assured that this information can not be linked to you personally.  


## Cookies

A cookie is a small file of information that is automatically stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive when you enter our web site. Cookies can only identify your computer and not the individual user, by storing some basic information which will enable us to identify if you have previously visited our web site. Cookies are only read by the server that placed them, and are unable to do such things as run programs on your computer, plant viruses, or harvest your personal information. The use of cookies is very common and viagogo's use of cookies is similar to that of other reputable online companies. 

Any personal information that you provide us with such as your name and address etc. is neither gathered nor stored in the cookies placed by the viagogo web site and, as a result, your information will not be passed on to any third parties.
