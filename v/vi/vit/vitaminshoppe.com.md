### II. Personal Information; Changes to Personal Information

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, first and last name, home or other physical address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information.

In general, you can visit the Site without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself. However, in order to make a purchase on the Site, we require you to register for an account and provide Personal Information. Moreover, other features or services may require you to provide Personal Information. For example, we may collect certain Personal Information if you choose to subscribe to a mailing list, participate in special offers, sweepstakes or other promotions, participate in our loyalty program or send questions or comments to us via e-mail. Of course, should you purchase any products on the Site, we will collect Personal Information from you, which we will use to fulfill your order and for other purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. Depending on how you use the Site, we may also collect Personal Information if you include Personal Information in any content you upload to the Site, e.g. as part of a product review, by posting to our Facebook page or other social media site, or as part of a post in a chat room. We will also collect Personal Information from you where you voluntarily provide it to us, including where you submit a question to our customer service personnel or where you submit a job application through our Site.

We may also collect certain demographic information (such as gender or age) and information about your interests and preferences ("Preferences Information"). In many cases, your providing such demographic and Preferences Information together with your Personal Information is optional. In other cases, such as online surveys, we collect this information on an anonymous basis. However, if we link any demographic or preferences information to any Personal Information, then such demographic and preferences information will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

For some features of the Site, you may be able to submit information about other people. For example, if you wish to e-mail an article from the Site or send information about an interesting product to a friend, you will submit your friend's e-mail address, or if you make a purchase for another person on the Site and want it shipped directly to that person, you may submit the recipient's name, address and certain other contact information. The Vitamin Shoppe will use and store any such information that we collect from you about another person to carry out your request and for our own internal marketing purposes.

### III. Aggregate Information

From time to time, The Vitamin Shoppe may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they "click" on. We collect this information through the use of "cookies" and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers or other third parties, or in response to a government request. The Vitamin Shoppe may also group demographic and preferences information and responses to surveys that we collect from visitors into aggregate data for the same purposes. However, please be assured that this aggregate data will not be disclosed together with your Personal Information under these circumstances.

### IV. Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies 

Some of our web pages utilize "cookies" and other tracking technologies. A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual's hard drive. For example, we may use cookies to collect information about website activity, to maintain your shopping experience in our online store, and to make product recommendations to you. We do not save credit card information in cookies. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser. However, please be aware that some features of the Site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. Moreover, your ability to complete a purchase may be compromised without enabling cookies in your Internet browser.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers or other third parties with links on the Site (as in Section XII). We do not control these cookies. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and times that our Site is accessed, and purchases. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the web. Web servers, the computers that "serve up" webpages, automatically identify your computer by its IP address. We may link the information we record using tracking technologies to Personal Information we collect at the Site for our own internal marketing and advertising efforts. However, we do not share this Personal Information with third parties. In addition, we may use IP addresses and other tracking technologies to identify a visitor when we feel it is necessary to enforce the Site's policies, to protect the Site, our customers or others, or when we believe in good faith that the law or judicial requires it.

The Site may also use a technology called "tracer tags". These may also be referred to as "Clear GIFs" or "Web Beacons". This technology is an invisible graphic on a web page that is programmed to collect non-personally identifiable information and allows us to understand which pages you visit on the Site. These tracer tags are used to help us optimize and tailor the Site for you and other Site visitors and allow us to provide personalized services and advertising content. 

We may also work with third party advertising companies who may use cookies or web beacons to better provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

### V. How We Use and Share Personal Information

**How We May Use Your Information**

With respect to the Personal Information we collect, we may retain and use that information for several purposes. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to process and fulfill any purchases you make on the Site (including any customary follow-up or confirmation communications regarding such purchases), process your catalog requests, enter you into sweepstakes you request, establish an account for you, update your loyalty account, respond to your questions, send e-mails to our mailing list subscribers, or, if you include Personal Information in any content uploaded to our Site, e.g. as part of a product review or a post in a chat room, as part of displaying or distributing such uploaded content or as part of our marketing and promotional activities. We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law. We may use your Personal Information in combination with any other information (whether personally identifiable or not) that we have collected from you in our stores or that we have otherwise acquired. We may also use the information that you provide as part of an application for employment as part of the application process, but we will not use such information for any other purpose. We use your e-mail address as a customer identifier on the Site. In addition, we may send you periodic communications by e-mail or regular mail, such as news updates, special promotional offers or information on our products or services which may be of interest to you. If you later wish to opt-out of receiving such promotional communications from us at any time, simply follow the instructions in Section VI.

**With Whom We May Share Your Information**

The Vitamin Shoppe has not and will not sell or rent your Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Except as disclosed below, You should never receive solicitations (i.e. “junk mail”) from unaffiliated third parties as a result of shopping or visiting The Vitamin Shoppe. However, we may disclose your Personal Information to third parties for other purposes, as set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and our mailing lists, processing orders and delivering products, sending postal mail and providing marketing assistance and data analysis. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties.

As The Vitamin Shoppe develops, we may buy other businesses or their assets or sell our business assets. Customer information is generally one of the business assets involved in such transactions. Thus, in the event that The Vitamin Shoppe or all of its assets are acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.

We may also share your personally identifiable and/or your non-personally identifiable information we collect, including your name, address, email address, and any transactions you conduct on our Site or offline with us with a third-party advertising partner and its service providers in order to deliver you advertising tailored to your interests when you visit certain other websites. Our advertising partner will anonymize the data we provide it so no one else will receive your personally identifiable information. You may opt-out of the tailoring of advertising based on information we collect. To learn more about the use of this information or to choose not to have this information used by our third-party advertising partner by opting out please visit the Network Advertising Initiative by clicking http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp

The Vitamin Shoppe fully cooperates with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities, and may in its sole discretion disclose Personal Information or other information to satisfy any law, regulation, subpoena, or government request, or in connection with litigation. The Vitamin Shoppe reserves the right to release Personal Information or other information about users who we believe are engaged in illegal activities or are otherwise in violation of our [Terms of Use Agreement](https://web.archive.org/content/en/support/help/legal_info.jsp), even without a subpoena, warrant or court order, if we believe in our sole discretion that such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to operate the Site, or to protect the rights or property of The Vitamin Shoppe, its affiliates, or any of their officers, directors, or employees, agents, third party content providers, suppliers, sponsors, or licensors. The Vitamin Shoppe also reserves the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities we reasonably believe in our sole discretion to be unlawful.

### VII. Security 

The Vitamin Shoppe intends to take reasonable steps to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access or disclosure. When you transmit Personal Information to our servers, your information is protected by both a "firewall" (a combination of computer hardware and software that helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within our computer network) and industry standard SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information and privacy, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you disclose or transmit to us online and cannot be responsible for the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of your Personal Information.
