# Privacy

Vitality Medical recognizes and respects the importance our customers place on privacy and security. To assure our customers a safe and confidential shopping experience, Vitality Medical uses Verisigns Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. The SSL technology is active on the credit card and personal information pages within our website. Verisign encrypts and keeps your credit card info safe by processing your card and only routing payment to Vitality Medical. Your credit card information is never stored or visible to Vitality Medical when you purchase online.

To check or verify the security of your connection, click on the Verisign logo found on the center of our home page. When navigating through our website you will also notice a closed lock or unbroken key at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the customer credit card entry pages. If you see a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending on your browser), then SSL is active and the server is secure. You can also double-check by looking at the URL address line of your browser. When accessing the credit card entry page or customer data form you will notice the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". The https change in the IP address denotes a secure IP address.

Some browsers and firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. If you access Vitality Medical through an insecure connection you will not be able to place an order online. If you cannot access our shopping cart, please print out our order form and place your order by phone at 1-800-397-5899.

## About Credit Card Transactions

**_Can I safely transmit information such as credit card numbers?_**

You can enter your credit card number on a secure (https) form and transmit the form over the Internet to a secure server without risk of an intermediary obtaining your credit card information. The security features offered by your web browser technology protects commercial transactions, as well as all other communications, from misappropriation and fraud that could otherwise occur as information passes through Internet computers.

With SSL implemented on both the client and server, your Internet communications are transmitted in encrypted form. Information you send can be trusted to arrive privately and unaltered to the server you specify (and no other).

SSL uses authentication and encryption technology. For example, your browsers export implementation of SSL (U.S. government approved) uses a High-grade, 128-bit key size. The encryption established between you and a server remains valid over multiple connections, yet the effort expended to defeat the encryption of one message cannot be leveraged to defeat the next message.

Your browser and secure servers deliver server authentication using signed digital certificates issued by trusted third parties known as certificate authorities ie. Verisign. A digital certificate verifies the connection between a server's public key and the server's identification (just as a driver's license verifies the connection between your photograph and your personal identification. Cryptographic checks, using digital signatures, ensure that information within a certificate can be trusted.

You can tell when you have a secure connection by looking at the location (URL) field. If the URL begins with https:// (instead of http://), the document comes from a secure server. To connect to an HTTP server that provides security using the SSL protocol, insert the letter "s" so that the URL begins with https://. You need to use https:// for HTTP URLs with SSL and http:// for HTTP URLs without SSL..

You can also verify the security of a document by examining the security icon in the bottom-left corner of the browser window.

Only your computer and the server can encrypt and decrypt your information. In transit, the information is an unreadable jumble. An intermediary can continue to route the data, and even make copies of it, but the information cannot be decrypted and remains private and safely communicated.

If you have any questions concerning our privacy and security policy, we can be reached by email at [question@vitalitymedical.com](mailto:question@vitalitymedical.com) or by telephone at: 1-800-397-5899 (outside USA 801-733-4449 or 801-733-5758).
