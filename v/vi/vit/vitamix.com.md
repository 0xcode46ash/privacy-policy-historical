If you do not agree to these terms, please do not use this Site. We reserve the right to change this Policy at any time. Such changes, modifications, additions or deletions shall be effective immediately upon notice thereof, which may be given by means including, but not limited to, issuing an email to the email address listed by registered users and posting the revised Policy on this page. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to maintain a valid email address as a registered user, review this Site and this Policy periodically and to be aware of any modifications.

**Privacy Policy**

  1. **Types of Information Collected.** The type of information we collect depends on how you use this Site. We collect two types of information about our users: Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us voluntarily and Non-Personally Identifiable Information. 
    1. **Personally Identifiable Information:**  refers to information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. You may voluntarily provide certain Personally Identifiable Information to us when you (a) register with us for an ecommerce store account or register your email address with us; (b) enter sweepstakes or contests sponsored by us; (c) sign up for special offers from select third parties; (d) send email messages or feedback, submit forms or transmit other information by email; (e) submit your credit card or other payment information when ordering and purchasing products and services on our Site; (f) submit or post content in discussion forums or other public areas of our Site; or (g) complete a survey. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone and facsimile numbers, credit card number, and other personal identifying information. Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
  

    2. **Non-Personally Identifiable Information:**  refers to information that does not by itself identify you as a specific individual. We gather certain non-personally identifiable information about you based upon how you search and shop through our site, including which pages you view and products you order while visiting our Site. For system administration and statistical analysis purposes, this information is compiled and analyzed on both a personal and an aggregated basis. This information may include the Web Site's Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") that you just came from, which URL you next go to, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address, which tells us the country and state you are searching our Site from. A URL is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web.
  

  2. **Collection Methods and Use of Information.** We do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information about you unless you voluntarily provide it to us when asked on our Site. You will have the chance to review the information you submit before completing any order, entry form or registration form. We use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide our services to you as required by our agreements with you, to resolve disputes and to enforce our agreements with you, including our Site Terms of Use and this Policy. We will also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you with a more efficient and customized educational and shopping experience, process your orders, improve our marketing and promotional efforts, statistically analyze Site use, improve our product and service offerings, and enhance our Site's content, layout, and services. We may contact you regarding administrative notices and/or send you occasional emails or regular mail regarding our products, services, special offers and upcoming events that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive this information, please click on the "Unsubscribe" link shown on all our emails and electronic newsletters to you or contact us at the address or telephone number listed below and we will remove your name from our mailing lists. We also collect, or enlist a third party service provider to collect, store, process and manage certain Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We use your Non-Personally Identifiable Information to diagnose problems with our servers and software, administer our Site, connect you to the correct ecommerce store for your country and gather and analyze demographic and other statistical information. Our third party service providers may also provide us with summary, but not individual, reports that will tell us how our Site is being used. We may also share such aggregate statistical and demographic information with select third parties, such as our advertisers, however, these reports do not contain any Personally Identifiable Information.
  

  3. **Release of Information.** We do occasionally sell your name and mailing address (but not your email address) to select companies whose products or services you may find of interest to you, however, we do not sell any other Personally Identifiable Information about you to other third parties. We also provide some of our services through contractual arrangements with affiliates, services providers and other third parties that require us to share your Personal Identifiable Information to them in order to deliver those services. For example, we must release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment for products and services purchased on this Site; release your address information to the delivery service to deliver products that you ordered; and provide order information to third parties that help us provide customer service. We encourage our service providers to adopt and post privacy policies. However, the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by our service providers is governed by their privacy policies and is not subject to our control. Occasionally we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.
  

  4. **Updating and Correcting Information.** You may change any of the personal information you have provided to us on this Site by clicking on "My Account", or you may change preferences by clicking on the "Update Profile" link attached to our emails and electronic newsletters, or by writing us at: Vita-Mix Corporation, 8615 Usher Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44138, Attn: Order Entry or by calling us directly at 1-800-848-2649. Please include your name, address, and/or email address when you contact us.  We will only keep your Personally Identifiable Information as long as we need it for the reasons it was originally collected from you. When we no longer need your Personally Identifiable Information for our purposes, we will destroy, delete or erase that information or convert it into an anonymous form in accordance with our standard data retention and destruction policies. You may ask to have the information on your account deleted or removed; however, because we keep track of past transactions, you cannot delete information associated with past transactions on this Site. In addition, it may be impossible to completely delete your information without some residual information because of backups.
  

  5. **Security of Information.** At our Site you can be assured that your Personally Identifiable Information is secure, consistent with current industry standards. The importance of security for all Personally Identifiable Information associated with our customers is of utmost concern to us. Your Personally Identifiable Information is protected in several ways. We encrypt your Personally Identifiable Information and thereby prevent unauthorized parties from viewing such information when it is transmitted to us. In addition, your Personally Identifiable Information resides on servers located in a controlled, secured environment that only authorized personnel have access to. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personally Identifiable Information, you acknowledge that: (a) there are security and privacy limitations of the Internet which are beyond our control; (b) the security, integrity and privacy of any and all information and data exchanged between you and us through this Site cannot be guaranteed; and (c) any such information and data may be viewed or tampered with in transit by a third party.
  

  6. **Cookies.** When you use our Site we will store cookies on your computer in order to facilitate and customize your use of our Site. A cookie is a small data text file, which a Web Site stores on your computer's hard drive (if your Web browser permits) for record keeping purposes. Our cookies store your ecommerce store user account information, the country where you are located, and your ecommerce store shopping cart selections so you do not have to select items more than once. The cookies make your use of the Site easier, make the Site run more smoothly and help us maintain a secure Site. You are always free to decline our cookies if your Web browser permits, but some parts of our Site may not work properly if you disable our cookies. We allow third party advertisers to display banner advertisements on our Site. These third party advertisers will place a separate cookie on your computer when you click on their banner. Vita-Mix does not provide our advertisers with any of your Personally Identifiable Information, however, Vita-Mix has no access or control over cookies used by such advertisers.

We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every website or Linked Site that collects personally identifiable information. You should contact advertisers, other websites or Linked Sites directly if you have any questions about their privacy policies or their use of the information they collect.
