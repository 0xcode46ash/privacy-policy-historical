**At vitacost.com we protect your privacy as if it were our own. We use the information you provide to us for four purposes only: to process your order(s), to reply to your questions, provide our newsletter via email and to incorporate your feedback into improvements to our Web site. We will not give, sell, or rent your personal information or specific account activity to anyone for any reason except as required by law.**

**Our Secure Ordering  
**At vitacost.com we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the information you send us when you place your order. The information is encrypted on your computer, sent through the Internet as jumbled code, and decoded on vitacost.com's secure server. It cannot be read in transit.

**Credit Card Fraud Protection  
**All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. Vitacost.com will protect you for this $50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving our company.

**Optional Phone Ordering  
**If you are still skeptical about placing your order online, you may place your order over the phone at (800) 793-2601 or via fax at 561-752-8900 during customer service hours: Monday through Thursday from 9am-9pm EST; Friday from 9am-6pm EST and Saturday from 10am-3pm EST. 

**Information We Collect  
**In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.

**When you visit our website, we collect non-personal information about your visit.** We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us permission to send to you). We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. 

**Our site uses cookies to store information between visits to our site.** Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor from one page to another. Web browsers store cookies so that the browser itself can remember some information and then, on request, pass all that information up to the server at one time. We use cookies to remember your name and the contents of your shopping cart. This allows you to leave our site, come back later, and still have the contents of your shopping cart intact. It also lets us personalize your experience at Vitacost.com, Inc., tailoring the content to your interests. Our website requires the use of cookies. Turning off cookies or rejecting the Vitacost.com cookie will prevent you from accessing the website. 

**When you subscribe to our newsletters or submit a question to "Ask the Doctor", Vitacost.com, Inc., asks you for contact information** (your name and email address). When you sign up for our newsletter we use your name and email address to send you our health newsletter and to inform you of sales and special offers. When you submit a question to "Ask the Doctor" your question and answer will be posted on the website for the public to view. Your first name, city, and state will be displayed. However, no information that would allow others to contact you will be disclosed by Vitacost.com. We will use your email address to send you the answer to your question and for no other purpose unless you opt in for our newsletter when you asked the question.

**Recommend product to a friend.** The information collected is used to send a one time only email to the friend letting them know about the product that the user recommends.

**If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and financial information** (such as your credit card numbers for purchases). Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, you can opt not to get email from us, as described in the opt-out section below. The credit card information we collect is used ONLY to bill you for products you purchase. For your convenience, your information including credit card and order history is stored on a secure server that allows you to reorder by entering your email address and password. You may also place a autoship order that will allow you to receive products on a regular basis without the need to reenter that order every time. You may cancel this order at anytime by sending an email to [cs1@vitacost.com](https://web.archive.org/help/contactusform.cfm) or calling **1-800-793-2601**. You will automatically be registered to receive our weekly newsletter unless you opt-out at the time of purchase. You may opt-out at any later time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the newsletter or sending an email to [newsletter@vitacost.com](mailto:newsletter@vitacost.com) with the word UNSUBSCRIBE followed by your email address in the subject of the email (example: UNSUBSCRIBE youremail@emailaddress.com).

**We have several types of third-party relationships.**

  1. We have an affiliate program that allows other websites to earn money by directing people (through links) to our website. If you sign up as an affiliate, your contact information (website address and related information, email address, mailing and payment addresses, and contact information) is sent to a third party who activates your affiliate status and pays you based on the sales you generate for Vitacost.com, Inc. The third-party affiliate manager (LinkShare) has its own privacy policy. http://www.linkshare.com/privacy.html
  2. We use third-party intermediaries. When you purchase from us, we send your credit card information, name, and billing address to credit card companies for verification and to authorize your purchase. 



**Our affiliates may have access to transaction-level data.** Our third-party affiliate program offers a feature that may allow a small number of selected affiliates to gain access to individual user transaction information that originates from links on their websites. These affiliates generally include, but are not limited to, rebate sites, member sites, charity fund-raising sites, school fund-raising sites, and association sites. To properly track and credit the customer's transaction, these sites may give each of their members a unique code, which will uniquely identify the member or the member's organization. This code is activated only when the customer links directly from the affiliate site to Vitacost.com, Inc. Any transactions made at Vitacost.com, Inc. while the code is active will be reported back to the affiliate. Vitacost.com, Inc. never passes on personal data as part of this feature. We will provide only the date of the transaction, the amount of the transaction, and the product purchased. To further protect the privacy of our customers, we require all affiliates requesting this feature to sign a statement promising to inform users beforehand of any such data collection, and to guarantee that any data collected will be used solely to reward users (or their selected charities) for their purchases. If you are concerned about having your purchase tracked in this manner, you may avoid it by visiting Vitacost.com, Inc. directly (without linking from an affiliate site). If the affiliate site has not made its tracking procedures clear to you, please notify us by e-mail at [cs1@vitacost.com](https://web.archive.org/help/contactusform.cfm). 

**We occasionally run our own online surveys** and we ask visitors for contact information (such as email address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age, or income level). We use contact data from our surveys to send users information about our company. You may opt-out of the survey and also opt-out of any future mailings at the time of the survey. The demographic information is used to learn more about the types of people who visit our site. This information is not shared with any other parties currently. We reserve the right to share this information with other parties in the future in an aggregated format that would not disclose any personally identifiable information. 

**Opt-Out**  
If you decide to opt out of our newsletter, our emails provide you the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us. You can also opt-out by sending an email to [cs1@vitacost.com](https://web.archive.org/help/contactusform.cfm) with the word unsubscribe followed by your email address in the subject line of the email.
