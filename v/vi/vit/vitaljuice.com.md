# Vital Juice Daily » Privacy Policy

We’re over committed … to protecting your privacy, that is.

We know it’s important to keep your personal information secure, so any details you (voluntarily! knowingly!) give us we use only to improve the quality of the juice we’re sending you every day. Other information we get–like which pages you visit or features you click–gets reviewed by the Juice Girls only (a.ka. juice improvement obsessives!). On occasion, we may provide our advertisers with aggregated, totally 100% anonymous information to help give them a taste of a Vital Juice Daily reader (come on, it helps us deliver free juice!). Oh, and there are these things called “cookies” (cookies? juice? Sounds like snack time!), which don’t contain any personally identifying information, but tell us (again, anonymously) when you’re on our site (or your computer is) so that we can be sure to serve up fresh juice and fresh ads (we wouldn’t want to bore you with the same old, same old you had yesterday!)

Last, but not least, take comfort in knowing that we will never sell your personal information to a third party!

So, don’t worry, be healthy!
