Please take a moment to review the terms of our Privacy Policy. Unless we indicate otherwise, this Privacy Policy applies only to information that we collect through the Services. By visiting our website or using the Services, you accept the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

**_Personal Information We Collect From You Directly_**

We may collect personal information about you in several ways, including when you provide it to us voluntarily. For example, we may collect personal information when you create an account or purchase online, contact us with questions, provide feedback regarding our products, or answer questions about your product interests. You do not have to provide your personal information to us, but if you decide not to do so, you may limit the features that you are able to access through the Services. 

The personal information we may collect includes:

We also may collect personal information about you from other sources, including from social media providers and commercially available sources, such as data aggregators and public databases. Please note that we may combine the various types of personal information we collect about you and use it as described in this Privacy Policy.

**__Log Files__**

We also may collect certain personal information by automated means when you visit our website or use the Services, including your internet protocol ("IP") address, information about your web browser software and version, if you arrived at our website through a link from a third-party website, the uniform resource locater ("URL") of the linking page, your mobile device identifier and other information about devices you use to access our website or the Services, and information about your activity while visiting our website or using the Services, such as which pages you choose to view, queries you make using our "search" function, and other information about your account usage.

We do not link this automatically collected data to other personal information that we collect about you.

**__Tracking Technologies__**

Like many companies, we and our third party partners, such as advertising partners, marketing partners, and service providers, use certain technologies, such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering our website, tracking users’ movements around our website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual, as well as aggregated basis.

You may be able to disable cookies by changing a setting in your web browser. Please note, however, that without cookies you may not be able to take full advantage of all the Services' features.

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs), such as HTML5 to store content information and preferences. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs.

**_Advertising_**

California law requires that we disclose whether or not we recognize and honor user browsers signals to not be tracked. If you wish not to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Customers from the European Union may alter their advertising preferences [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.com/uk/your-ad-choices).
