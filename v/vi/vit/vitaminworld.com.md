How We Protect Personal Information   
We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical and physical safeguards to protect against loss, misuse or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction of the information you provide on our Site.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or stored on a server can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

If you prefer not to transmit your credit card number over the internet, you can contact us using the toll-free number listed on the Site.
