# Privacy Policy - VitaRank

**Privacy Policy**

This policy covers how we use your personal information. We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information.

Any personal information received will only be used to fill your order. We will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone.

By default when you order we will use your E-mail to let you know about different promotions and discounts we are offering.

Each of our e-mails has an un-subscribe button so if you do not want to be e-mailed again just click it and you will never hear from us again.

We also ask that you please make sure that the links listed on your site take you to the appropriate location. When clicking on the options under, “Sitemap,” I was directed to the top of the page instead of the desired location.
