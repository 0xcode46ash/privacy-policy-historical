# Privacy Policy - Virtual Internet

This privacy applies to all companies in the Virtual Internet (UK) Ltd ("VI") group of companies. VI's policies and procedures for handling customer information are subject to change in accordance with the requirements of third parties such as domain name registration organisations and technological changes.

In the course of serving its customers, VI acquires stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private or sensitive. Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to VI by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by VI in the normal course of providing service.

We, and our agents, sub-contractors and other group companies, use contact information, supplied by customers, to occasionally send them newsletters, and other information about our company, its products and services and those of third parties which we believe will be of interest to you. VI may also use customer information to provide its customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.

Customers may opt out of receiving notices of new or upgraded products from VI and VI partners by sending a request to mailto:remove1@vi.net. In this request customers must identify: service purchased from VI, domain name (if applicable), contact information, and the date the service was purchased. However, customers may not opt out of receiving information from VI which is essential for maintaining or updating customers' accounts or system information.
