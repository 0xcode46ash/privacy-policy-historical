Virtual Internet (UK) Ltd Privacy Policy

This privacy applies to all companies in the Virtual Internet (UK) Ltd (“VI”) group of companies. VI’s policies and procedures for handling customer information are subject to change in accordance with the requirements of third parties such as domain name registration organisations and technological changes.

In the course of serving its customers, VI acquires, stores and transmits customer communications and information that customers may regard as private or sensitive. Some of this information - such as the customer's name, address, telephone number, and credit card data - is provided to VI by its customers in order to establish service. Other information - such as the customer's account status, choice of services, and customer logs - is created and maintained by VI in the normal course of providing service.

We, and our agents, sub-contractors and other group companies, use contact information, supplied by customers, to occasionally send them newsletters, and other information about our company, its products and services and those of third parties which we believe will be of interest to you. VI may also use customer information to provide its customers with system information or information about new or upgraded products.

Customers may opt out of receiving notices of new or upgraded products from VI and VI partners by sending a request to mailto:remove1@vi.net. In this request customers must identify: service purchased from VI, domain name (if applicable), contact information, and the date the service was purchased. However, customers may not opt out of receiving information from VI which is essential for maintaining or updating customers' accounts or system information.

Data Security

VI will protect the confidentiality of its customers' information, account information and personal communications as far as is reasonable and consistent with the law and the legitimate interests of VI, its partners, its employees and other customers of VI's services. To protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of information that is collected from customers, VI has physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place.

All other customers may access and modify their personal information by contacting the appropriate VI organisation.

Disclosure of customer information and communications

VI will not otherwise disclose its customers' personal and account information unless VI has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, make contact with, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing harm or interfering with the rights or property of VI, VI's customers, or others, or where VI has a good faith belief that the law requires such disclosure. 

VI also will not, except for reasons stated below, disclose to third parties the contents of any electronic mail or other electronic communications that VI stores or transmits for its customers. The circumstances under which VI will disclose such electronic customer communications are when: 

  * 1\. it is necessary in order to provide service to the customer; 
  * 2\. it is necessary to protect the legitimate interests of VI and its customers; 
  * 3\. it is required to cooperate with dispute policies, court orders, warrants, or other legal processes that VI determines in its sole discretion to be valid and enforceable 
  * 4\. it is necessary to provide to a law enforcement agency when the contents are inadvertently obtained by VI and appear to pertain to the commission of a crime.



VI disclaims any intention to censor, edit or engage in ongoing review or surveillance of communications stored on or transmitted through its facilities by customers or others. VI will, however, review, delete or block access to communications or take down websites or their content that may harm VI, its customers or third parties or otherwise infringe the rights of third parties. The grounds on which VI may take such action include, but are not limited to, actual or potential violations of VI's Acceptable Use Policy.
