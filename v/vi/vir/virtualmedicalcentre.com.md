Neither the general public nor other registered members can access your Personal Journal. However if you would like to share any experiences or entries with other registered members you can do so by asking (via the website) for that particular entry to be posted to the Patient Gallery. Only other registered members can access the Patient Gallery. All postings to the Patient Gallery are first checked and reviewed by virtualmedicalcentre.com for their content and appropriateness. virtualmedicalcentre.com reserves the right to veto any posting if it deems it inappropriate.

  * To let us know who you are; 
  * To help us identify special offers, events or other matters that might interest you, and inform you about them (if you have indicated to us via the website that you wish to be informed); 
  * To aggregate anonymous statistical information to be used to ensure that the type, quality and amount of information on the website reflects the needs of the members. 



#### Third Parties and Your Personal Information 

Virtualmedicalcentre.com will not disclose to any unrelated third party any of your personal information except as provided for below:

  * Where virtualmedicalcentre.com believes in good faith that you have consented;

#### On-line Security

Virtualmedicalcentre.com takes the issue of your on-line security seriously. 

On-line access to your information is protected by your virtualmedicalcentre.com user name and password which must be provided before you can gain access to your information. As a registered member there is an option for virtualmedicalcentre.com to remember "user name and password" so that you do not have to log in every time you use the site. Obviously if you are using a public computer this would enable any member of the public to visit the site and view your personal information. This would therefore not be an option you would choose. If, however, you are the only user of the computer it may be something you may wish to use for convenience. Virtualmedicalcentre.com cannot take any responsibility for any unauthorized access in these circumstances.

#### Anonymity

You may browser the VirtualMedicalCentre.com websites freely, without having to provide any personal identifying information. Although membership is necessary to access certain areas, the personal information required is kept to a minimum.
