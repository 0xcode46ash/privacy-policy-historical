# Virus Bulletin : Privacy statement

Your privacy is important to us. This notice explains our online information practices and gives information on the way your information is collected and used. The notice is available on every appropriate page of the site. 

The information we collect We use non-identifying and aggregate information in order to improve the design and functionality of our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. From each user visiting our site we collect the time of visit, the pages visited, the referring site (where appropriate), the hostname of the user, the browser used, and in some cases, a user's mouse-trail on the front page. 

Again, it's important to stress that this information is collected and processed in aggregate, and no attempt is made to link this information back to the user, or to identify them from the information provided. 

Further information Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/) directly.
