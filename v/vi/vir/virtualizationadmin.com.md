# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

We are committed to fair information practices and we respect the privacy and security of our users. Our goal is to provide you with a personalized Internet experience that delivers the information, resources, and services that are most relevant and helpful to you. In order to achieve this goal, we sometimes collect information during your visits to understand what differentiates you from each of our millions of other users, and we may also ask you for personal information that enables us to give you access to some parts of our web site. We will not disclose your information to any person outside our organisation except as described in this Privacy Policy.

To demonstrate our commitment to your privacy, we have prepared this statement disclosing our privacy practices. This statement describes what personal identifying information is collected, how and when we might use your information, how we protect your information, who has access to your information, and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

## Information Collected By Us

We collect certain information from and about our visitors in three ways: from our web server logs, by means of cookies, and directly from you.

_Web server logs_. When you visit our Web sites, we may track information to administer the site and analyze its usage. Examples of information we may track include your internet protocol address, what kind of browser or computer you use, the number of links you click within the site, the state or country from which you accessed the site, the date and time of your visit, the name of your internet services provider, the last page you viewed before visiting our site, and the pages you viewed on the site.

_Cookies & beacons_. If your browser allows it, our web sites use cookies, which are small text files which you computer creates or modifies on instruction of the page opened in your browser. These are used to save your preferences and login information. You can reject cookies by changing your browser settings.

Furthermore, if your browser allows it, third party cookies may be used for adverts placed in the pages of our website. The third-party advertising companies which serve ads when you visit our website may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. This information is neither controlled nor used by us and subject to the privacy policies of the third parties concerned, but to the best of our knowledge this information does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number.

Specifically, if your browser allows it, where Google adverts placed in the pages of our website, Google will attempt to use one or more cookies called 'DoubleClick DART cookie' to serve ads based on your visit to our sites and to other sites on the Internet. You can find more information, and opt out of Google advertising cookies, at <http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html>. 

Furthermore, where third party ads, and specifically Google adverts are placed in the pages of our website, a web beacon may be included. A web beacon is a small and unnoticable image served by the third party advertiser in order to collect information from your browser. To the best of our knowledge this information consists of the routine information usually provided by your browser when requesting a page or other internet resource, and does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number.

If javascript is not enabled in your browser, or if you use certain ad-blockers, you may not see adverts and therefore you may not be aware that ads are being served.

_Information from you_. Visitors can register to obtain access to some parts of our web site. When you register, we will ask you for some personal information. Some of the information requested will be required for registration, and some may be optional. Also, we may ask you to disclose personal information to enable us to provide assistance and information to you.

We do not disclose any information about any subscriber's usage of our web site except in specific cases, and we do not share information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes unless you expressly give us permission to do so.

_Identifiable information_. We will share your personal data as required by law or by the order of any competent court or (semi-)governmental authority or in matters of public safety or policy.
