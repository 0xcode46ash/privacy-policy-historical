#### INFORMATION COLLECTION AND USE BY Virb

Virb collects User submitted personal information such as name and email address to send notifications to those Users relating to, without limitation, the Virb service, special events, contests and special offers.

As is standard practice on many corporate websites, Virb also logs non-personally-identifiable information including IP address, profile information, aggregate user data, and browser type, from Users and other visitors to the site. This data is used to improve the website services, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Virb will not use the information collected to market directly to that person. This non-personally-identifiable information may be shared with third-parties to provide more relevant services and advertisements to Users. User IP addresses are recorded for security and monitoring purposes.

In addition Virb uses pixel tags - tiny graphic images - to tell us what parts of our website have been visited or to measure the effectiveness of searches customers perform on our site. Pixel tags also enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read. And they tell us whether emails have been opened to assure that we're only sending messages that are of interest to our customers. Virb stores all of this information in a secure database.

Virb may also use a User's email address to send updates, a newsletter or news regarding the service. Virb may send email messages which use a "click-through URL" linked to content on the Virb website. When a customer clicks one of these URLs, they pass through our web server before arriving at the destination web page. Virb tracks this click-through data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications. If you prefer not to be tracked simply avoid clicking text or graphic links in the email.

From time to time, Virb or a partner may sponsor a promotion, sweepstake or contest on Virb. Users may be asked to provide personal information including name, email address or home address or to answer questions in order to participate. Virb may transfer personal information to certain ad partners that you have explicitly requested to receive information from. It will be clear at the point of collection who is collecting the personal information and whose privacy statement will apply.

Virb may also collect information for market research purposes to gain a better understanding of our customers and thus provide more valuable service.
