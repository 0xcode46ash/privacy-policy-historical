|  Security & Privacy Info

VirtualAvenue values your privacy and we make every effort to ensure the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We will not disclose your personally identifiable information unless you give us permission or unless required by law. VirtualAvenue is part of the InfoSpace Network. Please review the information below for further details about our privacy and security policies. 

 Security Information 

Security is a top priority for VirtualAvenue. We protect our merchants' credit card information in a number of ways. Most importantly, all requests and responses for credit card data are encrypted using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology during transmission over the Internet. 

In addition, merchants have the option of utilizing InfoSpace's [Authorize.Net](http://www.authorize.net/), the Internet's leading payment gateway, providing secure online transaction processing. Any credit card information hosted by Authorize.Net is stored on a secure server outside of the Internet environment. While InfoSpace and Authorize.Net make every effort to provide a secure environment, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

All VirtualAvenue accounts are password-protected, so only you and those you designate can access the account and view the member information relevant to the account. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. 

 Site Usage Information

InfoSpace gathers "site usage" information from all visitors to the InfoSpace Web sites. Such data is used in the aggregate, to help determine general usage patterns and fine tune layout in order to ensure that our sites are as useful and enjoyable as possible. This "site usage" and statistical information may be made public information at InfoSpace's discretion. 

Please note that InfoSpace does not control all HTML served in conjunction with its sites. InfoSpace sites may include content from other parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein. In particular, some of our partners may use "cookies" in ways that we do not. 

 Individual User Information

Individually identifiable information will not be released without that individual's prior consent. Visitors are specifically asked for individually identifiable information when signing up to use certain InfoSpace services, such as the Silicon Investor message boards, or the PlaySite membership option. In some instances, users may be asked for personal interest and demographic information in order to create a more customized user experience; however these fields will generally be optional. 

From time to time, InfoSpace and/or its partners may wish to contact individual users regarding community news or to make promotional offers. However, such communications will only be delivered to users who have previously approved them. 

 Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under age of 13)

In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with InfoSpace policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

  1. Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; 
  2. Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; 
  3. Give children the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information; 
  4. Entice children with the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity. 



Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to: 

 Disclosure

InfoSpace reserves the right to access and disclose individually identifiable information to comply with applicable laws and lawful government requests, to operate its systems properly or to protect itself or its users. Where practical, InfoSpace will attempt to obtain the prior consent of the individual prior to disclosing individually identifiable information. As mentioned above, we reserve the right to share aggregated "site usage" information with third parties.
