# Virtualmin - Privacy Policy

Virtualmin, Inc. is firmly committed to insuring your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. We may use client IP addresses to diagnose problems with our web-site. Client access information is stored for the purposes of monitoring site usage and performance. IP information is not made available to third parties, and is not used for the purpose of marketing our products or third party products. Purchased software requires a license key, and an active software updates subscription on our updates server, in order to function fully. License keys and subscription IDs are used only for the purpose of verifying license compliance, and notifying customers of upcoming license renewals. This data will not be sold or disclosed to third parties. Any personal and financial information gathered for the purposes of commerce will be transmitted via a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) connection with 128-bit encryption, using a certificate provided by Starfield Technologies. This information will be kept confidential. Your email address will be used to email copies of your order information including order number and details. We do not give away or sell your email address to other companies. We only use this information to contact you regarding your order and to provide better customer support. In the Virtualmin.com community there are many opportunities to subscribe to email notifications and mailing lists, but you will not be subscribed automatically to any email notifications or mailing lists. You may unsubscribe from our website notifications or mailing lists at any time. Your name, address, and phone number may be stored in our system so that we can better serve you, when you return to our site or file a support issue. Only Virtualmin, Inc. staff members will have access to details beyond your community username (and any information you choose to disclose in the Virtualmin community forums). Credit card purchases are processed in realtime, and your credit card details are not retained in system storage after the order has been processed.
