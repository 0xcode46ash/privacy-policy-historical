**1) Your Information**

We, WagerWorks UK Limited and WagerWorks (Alderney) 5 Limited (collectively referred to as "WagerWorks" "We", "Us", "Our") take care to protect the privacy of Our players. This policy explains how We process information about website visitors and those registered with Virgin Games. There are several security features on Our site. Your personal details are protected by firewalls, encryption, and other security measures. Our employees do not have access to your full debit/credit card details. We are committed to the security of your personal details. 

Personal information is collated and stored primarily during the registration process, but is also monitored when there is activity on your account and when you use the website. Personal details submitted to Us by you will be used for the following purposes only. We will only collect and retain personal details to the extent that it is strictly necessary for one of the following purposes: assisting Us in setting up and managing your account; building an accurate customer profile; making information from WagerWare licensees and Virgin Games' marketing partners available: and publishing on the website and in other promotional materials, for the purpose of promoting the site, information relating to wins of Â£10 or more comprising the amount of the win and the abbreviated name, home town, state or province and country of the winner.

By using this Web Site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by WagerWorks Alderney 5 Limited, WagerWorks UK Limited, WagerWorks Inc., and Virgin.com Limited (trading as Virgin Games). Virgin.com Limited will own your personal details. Please note that the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) and Gaming Board for Great Britain (GBGB) have access to your account information. However, this information will only be used within the rules and guidelines that govern this site. 

**2) Disclosing Your Information**

We use third parties to validate your registration information. We may from time to time share the information you have given to us to confirm your identity. A third party will check any details we disclose to them against any databases to which they have access and will keep a record of that check. The third party will also retain your personal details and may use them in the future to assist other companies with identity verification. You agree that we may process, use, record, and disclose personal information, which you provide us in connection with your application for membership and that such personal data may be recorded by Us or the third party. Where We deem it necessary, you authorise Us to confirm the accuracy of the information you have submitted against government-issued ID.

Where you give Us permission to do so, We may transfer a copy of your personal details to a company in the Virgin Group to allow easy and quick registration with that company. Once you have registered with that company, your personal details will be held according to their privacy policy.

Other than as stated above, personal details collected about you when you visit this site will be disclosed only to the following types of persons or partners: reputable marketing partners selected by Us; any company or other entity to whom Virgin.com Limited may sell all or part of its business; any competent legal, regulatory or law enforcement authority including the AGCC and GBGB. In the latter case, you will not be informed of any disclosure nor of any reasons for such disclosure and you hereby waive any and all rights that you may have, whether at law or otherwise, of any nature and in any jurisdiction, in connection with such disclosure; Our professional advisers or other appropriate third parties, if your use of Our service, Our games or this website is in breach of these terms and conditions; and other users of the site and persons receiving promotional materials, in each case pursuant to the information We provide about winners detailed above. 

Virgin Games is part of the World Wide Web and because of this your personal details may be transferred outside Alderney and the European Economic Area. Whenever such transfers are effected pursuant to arrangements made by Us, We shall enter into agreements requiring the recipients of your personal details to adhere to standards of data protection substantially similar to those prevailing in Alderney and the UK. However, the Internet is made up of a large variety of international connections and if you are visiting this website the various communications may well result in the transfer of information outside the European Economic Area other than pursuant to contractual arrangements made by Us. By visiting the website and communicating electronically with Us you consent to these transfers. All sensitive player details are protected in accordance with the Data Protection Law (Bailiwick of Guernsey) 2001 and the Data Protection Act 1998. In addition, We consult the EU privacy laws and the OECD guidelines regularly to ensure the protection of players' privacy and transborder data flow.

**3) Marketing**

We'll only use your personal details for marketing purposes when you have given Us permission to do so. When you register, We'll clearly state:

"We may from time to time send you information about Virgin Games products and services and those offered by other companies in the Virgin Group; details of special offers or promotions; and any other advertising or marketing materials that We think might interest you. Please indicate if you would like to be contacted by Us in this way by ticking yes or no below." 

If you do not wish to receive this promotional or other information then please check the appropriate box(es) during the registration process. 

**4) Correcting/Accessing Your Information**

To make corrections or to obtain access to the personal details We have about you, you must send Us a written request that should be addressed to the Director of Customer Services for Virgin Games. We will disclose to you your personal details held by Us, We shall correct or delete inaccurate details, and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes.
