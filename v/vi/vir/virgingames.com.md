# Virgin Games - Privacy

Privacy Policy

**To use this site, you need to agree to give us some personal details. Here’s why.**

## 1) Your information

The games on this site come from a company called WagerWorks Alderney 5 Limited, and they’ve taken great care to look after you all. This includes putting in place lots of security measures. So when you give your personal details, they’ll be protected by firewalls, encryption, and more. Employees don’t have access to them. 

Here’s what your personal information is used for: getting your account set up, and looked after; building an accurate customer profile; making information from WagerWare licensees and Virgin Games' marketing partners available for promoting the site, on the internet and other marketing materials. We might also promote wins of £10 or more, but we’ll just mention the amount and the abbreviated name, town, state or province and country of the winner. Your full name won’t be used.

By using this site, you agree to the collection and use of this information by WagerWorks Alderney 5 Limited, WagerWorks UK Limited, WagerWorks Inc., and Virgin.com Limited (trading as Virgin Games).

Virgin.com Limited will own your personal details, but please note that the Alderney Gambling Control Commission (AGCC) and Gaming Board for Great Britain (GBGB) will also have access to your account information. However, this information will only be used within the rules and guidelines that govern this site.

## 2) Sharing your info

We use third parties to validate your registration information, so occasionally we may have to share the info you give us to confirm your identity.

This third party will check your details against their databases, and will keep a record of this. They’ll also keep your personal details, and may use them in the future to assist other companies with identity verification.

You need to agree to all of this, as well as authorising us to confirm the accuracy of your details using government-issued ID. 

We may need to transfer a copy of your personal details to a company in the Virgin Group to allow easy and quick registration with that company. Once you have registered with that company, your personal details will be held according to their privacy policy. But we’ll only do this if you say it’s okay – we’ll always ask first.

As well as what we’ve just mentioned, personal details collected about you when you visit this site may also be shared with the following: reputable marketing partners selected by us; any company that Virgin.com Limited may sell all or part of its business to; any competent legal, regulatory or law enforcement authority including the AGCC and GBGB. In the latter case, you will not be told of this disclosure or the reasons why, and you’ll be waiving any and all rights that you may have in connection with such disclosure.

If you breach these terms and conditions, we’ll give your personal details to our professional advisers or other appropriate third parties. We also give out details about winners, as previously mentioned.

Your personal details may go outside Alderney and the European Economic Area – that’s because Virgin Games is part of the internet. But if we’re making the arrangements, we’ll make sure that whoever gets your details sticks to data protection standards similar to those in Alderney and the UK.

But remember, the internet is large and international, so sometimes details do go outside the European Economic Area. By visiting the website and communicating electronically with us, you consent to these transfers. All sensitive player details are protected in accordance with the Data Protection Law (Bailiwick of Guernsey) 2001 and the Data Protection Act 1998. Plus, we consult the EU privacy laws and the OECD guidelines regularly to ensure the protection of players' privacy and transborder data flow.

## 3) Marketing

We'll only use your personal details for marketing purposes when you say it’s okay to. When you register, we'll clearly state:

"We may from time to time send you information about Virgin Games products and services and those offered by other companies in the Virgin Group; details of special offers or promotions; and any other advertising or marketing materials that we think might interest you. Please indicate if you would like to be contacted by us in this way by ticking yes or no below." 

If you don’t want promotional or other information, make sure you tick the right box!

## 4) Updating your details

Think something’s wrong? Need to make a change? No problem. Just write to us.

Send a letter to the Director of Customer Services for Virgin Games. We’ll then show you the info we have, and you can let us know what needs to change. We’ll let any third parties know of the changes, too.

But before you write, remember there are some changes you can make yourself. Just log in, then visit 'My Account'. You can update some information right there.

## 5) Cookies

Cookies are data files that contain information on things like the pages you've visited, and the date when you last looked at them. So when you register, the cookies are the technology that let us keep track of your personal preferences. These preferences are sorted in a file on your computer's hard disk drive.

For example, a cookie tells us where you live, so we don’t have to keep asking you – that’d get annoying! The cookies are anonymous, though – they can’t reveal your identity, and won’t be used to track which other websites you use.

If one of our advertisers uses cookies, then we’re unable to access or control this.

Some of our web pages may also contain electronic images known as ‘web beacons’ – these let us count how many people have visited us. The information they collect is very limited – just a number, time and date, and details of the page. We may also carry web beacons placed by third party advertisers, but they don’t have any info that could identify you.

For more information about cookies, including how to disable them, visit: [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies).

Please note that without cookies, you might not be able to use all the features on this site.

## 6) General bits

On our website we have links to other websites – that’s to point you in the direction of other information or advice. However, you need to be aware that these sites might have different security or privacy policies to us. Also, we can’t be responsible for any information you give to them.

This privacy policy forms part of our website terms and conditions. It’ll be governed and run in accordance with the laws of England.

We hope that you enjoy using our website – we’ll be looking after you as best we can!
