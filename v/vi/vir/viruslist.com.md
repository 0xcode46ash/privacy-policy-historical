##  2\. USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. 

Traffic.com and its suppliers, business partners, affiliates, agents and other third parties will use Personal Information to provide you with the products and services you requested, to better understand your needs, and to respond to your requests. Unless you request otherwise through our opt-out process, we may also use Personal Information to deliver promotional information about Traffic.com and our product and services. From time to time, we may seek your permission to provide Personal Information (e.g. your email address) to specific business partners for their use in sending you promotional information. We will provide this information to our partners only if you allow it. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that our partners' use of such information is consistent with Traffic.com's Privacy Policy. 

You may choose not to provide us with any Personal Information. In such an event, you can still access and use many portions of the Website; however, you will not be able to access and use those portions of the Website or the services available on or through the Website that require your Personal Information. 

##  3\. DISCLOSURE AND SHARING OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. 

Traffic.com will not distribute, sell, rent or otherwise disclose your personal identifiable information to any third party except as follows: (i) to business partners, suppliers, affiliates, agents, and other third parties that help us provide certain services and products to you and to process payments (if applicable); (ii) in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Traffic.com's rights or property, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities; (iii) in special circumstances, such as the sale or potential sale of Traffic.com or the bankruptcy of Traffic.com; (iv) when we believe in good faith that it is required by law, or to comply with a court order or other legal process; (v) to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; and (vi) when you have consented to such disclosure.

When you signed up for service, you had the option of unchecking the selection box and choosing to continue to get our traffic services, but not receive newsletters or marketing material from Traffic.com. If you wish to modify your selection, please click the [contact information](http://secure.traffic.com/servlet/Controller?appname=userregistration&workflowname=accountMangMod&PARTNER=DEFAULT&metroid=0&numAction=2&service_choice=MY_TRAFFIC_FREE) link under 'my account'.

We may retain in our files information you have requested to remove in some limited circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our Terms of Use Agreement. Further, such prior information is never completely removed from our databases due to technical constraints and the fact that we back up our systems.
