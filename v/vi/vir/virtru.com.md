### Virtru values your privacy and security

  


##### This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information that we collect from you when you use Virtru.

### Our Principles

Transparency. We only use and share information about our users as spelled out in our Privacy Policy or other notices or in the agreements under which we provide the Services. We want you to know how we use your information, and to avoid any surprises.

Choice. We let our users know when and how we collect information and we are designing our Services to offer our customers choices about how their information is used.

Sensible Defaults. Our defaults try to balance user experience and privacy in as sensible a fashion as we can.

Limited Collection of Data. We seek to collect and retain the least amount of user data necessary for the functioning, security, and effective operation of our business.

Data Security. Security is our business.We use reasonable organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect personal information under our control.

Working with Partners. We make privacy a key factor in selecting service providers who have access to user information.

  


##### For us, "Personal Information" means:

  * Information which identifies you, like your name or email address; or
  * A combination of several pieces of information which couldn't identify you on their own, but which we believe would be sufficient to identify you when combined.



Any information that falls outside of this is "Other Information." If we combine your Personal Information with Other Information, we will consider the combination as Personal Information.

##### For users of our free and paid services, we may collect your email address, your IP address, and Virtru Application Data. Virtru Application Data consists of

  * Key Access Policies for each message or files you secure, as well as all updates to those Policies, such as revocation and adding or removing authorized users. Key Access Policies include the minimal metadata required to enforce the policy, such as authorized user email addresses, encryption keys and expiration date/time as well as a “Display Name” per policy for use in the online dashboard which may be a file name or email subject line.
  * Application Activations – We store a list of which applications have been activated for use by each user as well as when those activactions expire.



For users of our paid services only, we may collect full name and billing address. We use third party payment services to minimize billing data stored at Virtru. As a result, we do not need to store your credit card or other payment information.

##### We may use Personal Information:

  * To provide the Services.
  * To respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you e-mail updates you have requested or information regarding the Services, changes to our terms, policies or other administrative announcements.
  * To process your payments, provide you with the products or services you have purchased, communicate with you regarding your purchase and provide you with related customer service.
  * To send you communications regarding additional services that may be of interest to you. If you no longer wish to receive newsletters or other marketing-related email communications from Virtru, you can opt out from receiving them by following the “unsubscribe” instructions in the next such email you receive from us. Note that you may not opt-out of receiving some administrative announcements (such as changes to our policies).
  * To perform security analyses to verify that the Services are working properly and have not been compromised;
  * For our internal business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products, enhancing our website, improving our services, identifying usage trends and determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns.



##### We may disclose Personal Information in the following situations:

  * To our service providers to enable them to provide services on our behalf
  * We may use and disclose Personal Information as required to comply with applicable law. We will handle any government requests for encryption keys in accordance with our Frequently Asked Questions on Government Surveillance.
  * We may use or disclose Personal Information when we have a good-faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of you, our other users, Virtru or the public.
  * If our organizational structure or status changes (if we undergo a restructuring, are acquired, or go bankrupt,) we may pass your information to an acquirer, successor or affiliate.
  * We may disclose your Personal Information in other circumstances when we tell you and you consent to the sharing.

  * Through your browser: Certain information is collected by most browsers and sent to web servers so that sites can behave reliably, such as browser version, resolution and operating system.
  * Through server log files: An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider (ISP), and is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits the Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.
