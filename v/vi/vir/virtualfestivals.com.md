Privacy Policy

We regard your privacy as being of the greatest importance. 

Our registration process collects only information that we regard as being essential to the success of our business. 

We, or our contractors, use that information to register you in the Virtual Festivals service and to let you have the material you've asked for as part of that service. 

For certain other specialist services we provide, or entry into some competitions, we may require further details about you-such as personal interests. 

In addition we, or our contractors, make use of your information to send material to you about Virtual Festivals or other companies' products, which we think might interest you. 

We also use some of this information to build user profiles that allow us to target advertising more effectively. 

This makes us more attractive to advertisers and thereby helps to ensure the site's economic viability. 

Your personal details will not be divulged to any third party outside Virtual Festivals unless you have specifically agreed to this during the registration process.

Cookies also enable us to gain information about the use of our services and to enhance our site according to the preferences of our users. Of course, you can change your browser settings and use it without cookies.
