**Security  **

Virgin Pulse follows reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures designed to safeguard and secure your Personal Information.

Please be advised that you are responsible for keeping your password and username confidential and secure from unauthorized persons, and that you are responsible for any and all activities that occur under your member account.
