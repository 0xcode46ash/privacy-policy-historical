# Virgin Net - Terms & conditions

|  |   
---  
**Privacy policy for ISP**  
This is the Privacy Policy that you agreed to during ISP registration. If you have not registered for the ISP, please read the policy as it details the approach Virgin Net takes to the use of personal information from our ISP customers.  
At Virgin Net we use information collected online to develop and enhance the services we offer to you and to help us build our business. We take privacy issues seriously and are open about the way data is collected and used. This policy outlines the principles we follow.   
What data is collected and how is it used?   
  
  * When you visit Virgin Net we issue a "cookie" or unique code that allows us to identify your computer. The cookie is used to note the different Virgin Net services recently accessed through your computer - this can only be done for Virgin Net and not on any other sites you might visit. Information collected this way is used to develop and manage our online services. 
  * The "cookie" contains no personally identifying information. However, when you register with the Virgin Net web site or subscribe to the ISP the "cookie" will be combined with the personal information that you have given as part of the registration. 
  * When you register for Virgin Net, you need to choose a user name and password for authentication purposes. We also require an e-mail address. This may be used to send you information about your account and Virgin Net promotions. You may elect not to receive such promotions. 
  * We may occasionally ask our market research partners to contact you by telephone as part of a survey of our services. You will able to choose at the time whether or not you want to take part in that survey. 
  * Should you choose our ISP service, we require your name, address, and telephone number for authentication purposes and to help prevent network abuse. The software disk supplied when you subscribe contains a unique code that helps us track which marketing campaigns work best. 
  * Advertisers and advertising agencies that serve adverts onto Virgin Net may also attach their own cookies to your computer. If you want to find out about how these companies use these cookies, please refer to their own privacy policies found on their web sites. 

  
Does Virgin Net disclose information it collects to Third Parties?  
Only in very limited circumstances. Virgin Net does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Virgin Net provides aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic and related information to third-parties but these statistics include no personally identifying information. If you shop through one of the Virgin Net shopping services or the auction service, we collect personal information including payment details and pass them on to the relevant retail partner. If you chose our ISP payment and other personal information will necessarily be shared with our service providers.   
How does Virgin Net protect personal privacy?  
Virgin Net uses up to date industry procedures to keep personal data as safe and secure as possible and protect against loss, unauthorised disclosure or access. Please remember that you are responsible for protecting your password/user name and must not share it or allow its disclosure it to anyone.
