# Copyright and Privacy Policy at UVA

Copyright 2001 by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia  


**Official U.Va. Web Sites  
**Except as noted, the information below applies to official University of Virginia web sites, which are defined as the official web pages of University schools, departments, divisions and other units. You may also find within the University of Virginia domain -- signified by the address "virginia.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University of Virginia -- web sites over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control. Such sites include but are not limited to the web pages of individual faculty members or students and the web pages of student organizations and other organizations not formally a part of the University. Although the University encourages compliance with all University policies and practices at such web sites, the University serves only as a neutral provider of Internet-related services to them. The University recommends that you seek information from the persons responsible for those sites directly to ensure that you know under what policies and practices they operate.

**U.Va. Copyright/Disclaimer Statement**  
All text, images, logos and information contained on official University of Virginia web sites are the intellectual property of U.Va. unless otherwise registered and are protected under the U.S. Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. 101-810. Copyright gives the owner exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, or license a given work. Whether or not a web site includes a statement about copyright, the US copyright act provides protection for such works, and they may not be used or reproduced without permission. 

It is the responsibility of all parties storing materials on web sites with University of Virginia domain addresses to ensure that such material does not violate other parties' proprietary rights and does not otherwise violate law or applicable University policy. U.Va. reserves the right to delete or make inaccessible files that contain material that is in violation of law or of applicable U.Va. policy. U.Va. is not responsible for any errors in the material provided on the web and shall not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of any material found on official U.Va. web sites or on any other sites with University of Virginia domain addresses.

**** The design, pictures, and logos used on web sites directly managed by the University webmaster may not be copied and used or posted by any other person or entity, including other units/offices at the University of Virginia. This includes but is not limited to the University's Home Page, all Secondary Web Pages (blue button pages), news pages, and maps. Links may be directed to these pages, but images, logos, maps, may not be copied and/or posted for any reason.

The photographic banner at the top of the University's Home Page is the property of a freelance photographer and rights for use on the University's Home page do not transfer to any other University page.

The top red navigation bar may be copied by University offices, but only if links point to the same links as depicted on the Home Page.

Questions may be directed to the [University's Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@virginia.edu). More information on [copyright](http://www.lib.virginia.edu/copyright/index.html) issues at the University of Virginia is available.

**Links to Other Sites**  
Provision of links from official University of Virginia web sites to sites located outside of the University of Virginia domain does not imply endorsement or credibility of the service, information, or product offered through the linked sites.

**Privacy Notice **

**Commitment To Privacy.** Individuals' privacy is important to the University of Virginia. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information policy and practices. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available through a link on our homepage.

Our privacy and public records obligations are governed solely by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976, the Virginia Freedom Of Information Act, and by any applicable U.S. federal laws.

**Notice About The Information We Collect.** This notice applies to all information collected by or submitted to official University of Virginia web sites (see the definition above). The following information explains the Internet privacy policy and practices that the University has adopted for its official web sites In legal terms, it shall not be construed as a contractual promise, and the University reserves the right to amend it at any time without notice. 

In addition to this explanation of policy and practice, the University encourages its schools, departments, divisions and other units contributing to its official web pages to provide specific notices about the collection and use of any personal information associated with those pages. The following information is therefore general, and we encourage you to read page-specific notices to ensure that you understand precisely the applicable privacy policies and practices.

When you access our web pages, the client information and the essential and nonessential technical information listed below is automatically collected -- we refer to those categories collectively as "access" information. No other information is collected through our official web sites except when you deliberately decide to send it to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an e-mail). The information you might choose to send us is listed below as "optional information." 

  * **Automatically Collected Access Information**
    * **Client information** : the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using. 
    * **Essential technical information** : identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access. 
    * **Nonessential technical information** : the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our web site, and the "cookie information" described below. 
  * **Optional information** :   
-> _when you send us an e-mail_ :  
• your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail.

->

_when you complete online forms_ :  
• all the data you choose to fill in or confirm, including credit or debit card information if you are ordering a product or making a payment, as well as information about other people if you are ordering a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient's address. 



**The Way We Use Information.** Client information is used to route the requested web page to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan web site improvements. Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and also allows us to plan web site improvements.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our web site For example, we may report that _X_ number of individuals visited a certain area on our web site, or that _Y_ number of men and _Z_ number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

We may keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the web page is transmitted, but we do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our web site However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of access information are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. 

Under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, any records in our possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Request might be subject to being inspected by or disclosed to members of the public for any purpose they may desire. As indicated above, client information may be retained after transmission of the requested web page and might be available for inspection. 

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request.  Similarly,  we use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. Again, we do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request. 

We generally use return e-mail addresses only to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are generally not used for any other purpose and by University and state policy are not shared with outside parties. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without a clear notice on the particular site and without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Use of Cookies** Some official University of Virginia web sites use "cookies." Often a cookie enables the University web site to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the site (i.e., if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself as a student, your subsequent views of information might be tailored for student audiences). For this kind of cookie, the information stored in that cookie might include the following (formatted for legibility):

**Providing Information is Your Choice**. There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our web site However, our web site will not work without routing information and the essential technical information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our web site but may prevent certain features from working. For any optional information that is requested at the web site, failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the web page may not be available to you.   


**Our Commitment To Data Security** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, consistent with the policies of the University and with the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Virginia. 

**How To Contact Us** Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies and practices, please call us at (804) 924-4524 or send us an e-mail at webmaster@virginia.edu. If you wish to review or change information gathered about you via an official University of Virginia web site but you do not know how, the University webmaster will assist in locating the persons responsible for that site so that you may make your request for that review or change directly to them.
