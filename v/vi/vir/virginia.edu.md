# Copyright, Privacy, and Web Policies at U.Va.

_Except as noted, the information below applies to official University of Virginia Web sites, which are defined as the official Web pages of University schools, departments, divisions and other units. You may also find within the University of Virginia domain -- signified by the address "virginia.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University of Virginia -- Web sites over which the University has no editorial responsibility or control. Such sites include but are not limited to the Web pages of individual faculty members or students and the Web pages of student organizations and other organizations not formally a part of the University. Although the University encourages compliance with all University policies and practices at such Web sites, the University serves only as a neutral provider of Internet-related services to them. The University recommends that you seek information from the persons responsible for those sites directly to ensure that you know under what policies and practices they operate._

  
All text, images, logos and information contained on official University of Virginia Web sites are the intellectual property of U.Va. unless otherwise registered and are protected under the U.S. Copyright Act 17 U.S.C. 101-810. Copyright gives the owner exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, perform, display, or license a given work. Whether or not a Web site includes a statement about copyright, the US copyright act provides protection for such works, and they may not be used or reproduced without permission.

It is the responsibility of all parties storing materials on Web sites with University of Virginia domain addresses to ensure that such material does not violate other parties' proprietary rights and does not otherwise violate law or applicable University policy. U.Va. reserves the right to delete or make inaccessible files that contain material that is in violation of law or of applicable U.Va. policy. U.Va. is not responsible for any errors in the material provided on the Web and shall not be liable for any damages of any kind arising from the use of any material found on official U.Va. Web sites or on any other sites with University of Virginia domain addresses.

The design, pictures, and logos used on Web sites directly managed by the University Webmaster may not be copied and used or posted by any other person or entity, including other units/offices at the University of Virginia. This includes but is not limited to the University's Home Page, all Secondary Web Pages (blue button pages), news pages, and maps. Links may be directed to these pages, but images, logos, maps, may not be copied and/or posted for any reason.

The photographic banner at the top of the University's Home Page is the property of a freelance photographer and rights for use on the University's Home page do not transfer to any other University page.

The top red navigation bar may be copied by University offices, but only if links point to the same links as depicted on the Home Page.

Questions may be directed to the [University's Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@virginia.edu). Go here for additional information on [copyright](http://www.lib.virginia.edu/copyright/index.html).

**Links to Other Sites**  
Provision of links from official University of Virginia Web sites to sites located outside of the University of Virginia domain does not imply endorsement or credibility of the service, information, or product offered through the linked sites.

**Respect for Copyrights of Digital Materials and Software**  
_July 2001 (Revision of the previous Software Copyright Policy approved October 1995)  
Effective on interim basis pending review by the Office of the General Counsel_

It is the policy of the University to respect the copyright protections given by federal law to owners of digital materials and software. It is against University policy for faculty, staff, or students to use University equipment or services to access, use, copy or otherwise reproduce, or make available to others any copyright-protected digital materials or software except as permitted under copyright law (especially with respect to "fair use") or specific license.

The software provided through the University for use by faculty, staff, and students may be used only on computing equipment as specified in the various software licenses. 

The University regards violation of this policy as a serious matter, and any such violation is without its consent and is subject to disciplinary action. Repeated violations will result in loss of computing privileges, among other sanctions. 

Pursuant to 37 CFR 201.38, the University has designated the following person to receive notification from copyright owners of claimed infringement of copyright: 

R. F. German Jr.

**Commitment to Privacy.** Individuals' privacy is important to the University of Virginia. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information policy and practices. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available through a link on our homepage.

Our privacy and public records obligations are governed solely by applicable Virginia statutes, including, but not limited to, the Virginia Privacy Protection Act of 1976, the Virginia Freedom Of Information Act, and by any applicable U.S. federal laws.

**Notice About the Information We Collect.** This notice applies to all information collected by or submitted to official University of Virginia Web sites (see the definition above). The following information explains the Internet privacy policy and practices that the University has adopted for its official Web sites In legal terms, it shall not be construed as a contractual promise, and the University reserves the right to amend it at any time without notice.

In addition to this explanation of policy and practice, the University encourages its schools, departments, divisions and other units contributing to its official Web pages to provide specific notices about the collection and use of any personal information associated with those pages. The following information is therefore general, and we encourage you to read page-specific notices to ensure that you understand precisely the applicable privacy policies and practices.

When you access our Web pages, the client information and the essential and nonessential technical information listed below is automatically collected -- we refer to those categories collectively as "access" information. No other information is collected through our official Web sites except when you deliberately decide to send it to us (for example, by clicking on a link to send us an e-mail). The information you might choose to send us is listed below as "optional information."

  * **Automatically Collected Access Information**
    * **Client information** : the Internet domain and Internet address of the computer you are using. 
    * **Essential technical information** : identification of the page or service you are requesting, type of browser and operating system you are using; and the date and time of access. 
    * **Nonessential technical information** : the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Web site, and the "cookie information" described below. 
  * **Optional information** :   
-> _when you send us an e-mail_ :  
• your name, e-mail address, and the content of your e-mail.

->

_when you complete online forms_ :  
• all the data you choose to fill in or confirm, including credit or debit card information if you are ordering a product or making a payment, as well as information about other people if you are ordering a gift and want it sent directly to the recipient's address.



The University of Virginia uses Web Trends Live to analyze traffic to much of the virginia.edu Web site. Web Trends Live does not create individual profiles for visitors. Unlike some tracking services Web Trends Live does not have a database of individual profiles for each visitor. Web Trends Live only collects aggregate data. [More information](http://www.webtrendslive.com/privacy_policy.htm).

**The Way We Use Information.** Client information is used to route the requested Web page to your computer for viewing. In theory, the requested Web page and the routing information could be discerned by other entities involved in transmitting the requested page to you. We do not control the privacy practices of those entities. Essential and nonessential technical information helps us respond to your request in an appropriate format [or in a personalized manner] and helps us plan Web site improvements. Optional information enables us to provide services or information tailored more specifically to your needs or to forward your message or inquiry to another entity that is better able to do so, and also allows us to plan Web site improvements.

We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Web site For example, we may report that _X_ number of individuals visited a certain area on our Web site, or that _Y_ number of men and _Z_ number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

We may keep client information from our systems indefinitely after the Web page is transmitted, but we do not try to obtain any information to link it to the individuals who browse our Web site However, on rare occasions when a "hacker" attempts to breach computer security, logs of access information are retained to permit a security investigation and in such cases may be forwarded together with any other relevant information in our possession to law enforcement agencies. 

Under the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, any records in our possession at the time of a Freedom of Information Request might be subject to being inspected by or disclosed to members of the public for any purpose they may desire. As indicated above, client information may be retained after transmission of the requested Web page and might be available for inspection. 

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request. Similarly, we use the information you provide about someone else when placing an order or request only to complete that order or request. Again, we do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order or request. 

We generally use return e-mail addresses only to answer the e-mail we receive. Such addresses are generally not used for any other purpose and by University and state policy are not shared with outside parties. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without a clear notice on the particular site and without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Use of Cookies** Some official University of Virginia Web sites use "cookies." Often a cookie enables the University Web site to tailor what you see according to the way you entered the site (i.e., if you entered by pushing a button identifying yourself as a student, your subsequent views of information might be tailored for student audiences). For this kind of cookie, the information stored in that cookie might include the following (formatted for legibility):

**Providing Information is Your Choice**. There is no legal requirement for you to provide any information at our Web site However, our Web site will not work without routing information and the essential technical information. Failure of your browser to provide nonessential technical information will not prevent your use of our Web site but may prevent certain features from working. For any optional information that is requested at the Web site, failure to provide the requested information will mean that the particular feature or service associated with that part of the Web page may not be available to you.   


**Our Commitment To Data Security** To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online, consistent with the policies of the University and with the laws and regulations of the Commonwealth of Virginia.

**How To Contact Us** Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies and practices, please call us at (804) 924-4524 or send us an e-mail at Webmaster@virginia.edu. If you wish to review or change information gathered about you via an official University of Virginia Web site but you do not know how, the University Webmaster will assist in locating the persons responsible for that site so that you may make your request for that review or change directly to them.

  
Consistent with University and state policy on the appropriate use of equipment, the University’s Web site (signified by the address "virginia.edu" or within the range of Internet protocol addresses assigned to the University of Virginia) cannot be used for commercial, non-mission-related purposes.

In practice, this means that advertising space cannot be sold at any level of the Web site. Only under one of the limited circumstances below may a commercial logo, link or other material appear, if judged by the University’s Webmaster or, upon request, by the N-BIS editorial board, to be consistent with the University’s mission and with established graphic and placement standards for the page. (See [Guidelines for Web design](http://www.virginia.edu/universityrelations/webguide/index.html).) For example, commercial logos or display material may not be placed in the “banner” area, roughly the top quarter of a page.

  * The logo or graphic represents licensed software on which a core function of the page is based, e.g., Netscape, Adobe Acrobat Reader, RealAudio, Thunderstone, VeriSign.
  * The link is to a vendor or other entity with a separately contracted relationship to provide services to the University, e.g., ARAmark, Fidelity Insurance, Reebok.
  * On a fourth-level page or below (with the University’s Home Page as the top level) – except under special circumstances considered on a case-by-case basis – the logo or link is displayed to acknowledge external support of mission-related activities.
  * Such logos or links are deemed to be recognition of corporate or other external sponsorship. Examples of pages that might include such acknowledgments include University Career Services, the athletics department, and those of sponsored academic activities, such as the Center for Governmental Studies.
  * The text link provides information for educational or other mission-related purposes and the University has received no consideration for incorporating that link.

**Definition  
**The University of Virginia Home Page (http://www.virginia.edu/) is the official Internet site for the University of Virginia. The "official" Home Page structure includes the Home Page, the blue button secondary pages, the four special interest pages, and other sites integrated into the Home Page structure (maps, calendars, search, Web site index, addresses). Pages that replace or supplement existing Home Pages through new interactive technologies (such as portals) are considered part of the Home Page structure.

**Purpose**  
The objective of the Home Page is to provide a point of entry for the academic and public community to the University's officially recognized information resources though links and navigational mechanisms and to provide timely content and links to news and events of general interest about the University of Virginia. The following audiences are especially targeted: Students, Faculty and Staff, Prospective Students, Alumni and Friends as well as the community and citizens of the Commonwealth.

**Responsibility**  
The University's Web site is produced by the Office of University Web Communications in University Relations. The Webmaster, reporting through the University's Network-Based Information Systems committee ([N-BIS](http://www.itc.virginia.edu/oit/org/committees/nbis/gen_info.html)), has the responsibility of defining the content, look, feel, interface, links, information architecture and navigation of the University's official Home Pages. 

This is done through a variety of guiding principles and policies approved by N-BIS. N-BIS is appointed by the University-wide Committee on Information Technology (UCIT) to serve as an editorial board overseeing the availability and use of the Grounds-Wide Information System (GWIS), and specifically, the Home Page. In general, N-BIS does not approve individual items in GWIS, but it does: 1. Approve the awarding of a directory to and/or the linking of a Home Page by organizations and individuals eligible to do so. 2. Approve categories of information placed on GWIS. 3. Serve as an appeal board for determining whether material placed on GWIS is or is not appropriate. 4\. Serve as the first step in the appeal process regarding retention of GWIS privileges. Decisions by the N-BIS editorial board to revoke access to GWIS may be appealed to the Vice President and Chief Information Officer. Students and student organizations are, in addition, subject to the Standards of Conduct in their use of GWIS. 

[Nancy A. Tramontin](mailto:nancyt@virginia.edu) is the University Webmaster and has responsibility for management, content, and design of the top-level and second-level pages, and associated functions and technologies of the University of Virginia Web site (www.virginia.edu). She is assisted in Web development and production by [Hilary Swinson](mailto:hswinson@virginia.edu), Web editor; [Tasha Campbell](mailto:tcampbell@virginia.edu), and Web assistant [Anna Rugo](mailto:annar@virginia.edu). 

**Home Page Policies**  
Links: The University of Virginia Home Page provides a framework and mechanism for structured retrieval of officially authorized information resources of the institution through links on each of its blue button navigation, pop-up menu links, and other Home Page navigation. Publications and other information resources created by an official unit or other recognized organization of the University or an individual-created information resource which is sponsored by an official unit or registered organization are eligible for inclusion in the University of Virginia Web site.

Links of appropriate information is accomplished through the Office of the Webmaster, a centrally managed registry of authorized information resources.

[Current Students](http://www.virginia.edu/OfCurr.html)  
[Faculty and Staff](http://www.virginia.edu/OfFac.html)  
[Alumni and Friends](http://www.virginia.edu/OfAlum.html)

Individual personal Home Pages are linked through a separate [directory of personal Home Pages](http://www.virginia.edu/dir.html) of University students, staff, and faculty

Links will not be made to unsponsored personal resources--e.g., a personal or other Home Page for which a unit has not accepted responsibility.

Non-University resources: i.e., information resources which originate from a non-University Internet host will, in most cases, not be linked directly to the University of Virginia site. Exceptions to this can include instances where a non-University host provides information generally-recognized of University interest (athletics, Charlottesville links). 

**Logos, Trademarks, and Licensed Graphics**  
Official University of Virginia logos, seals, and graphics relating to the University may be subject to licensing agreements and any use of these would require approval. If you have questions about legal use of these items, contact [Andrew Rader](mailto:alr3y@virginia.edu), Sports Licensing/Marketing Director at (434) 982-5600. Authorized logos may be found at <http://www.virginia.edu/uvalogo>

**Photographs, Graphics, and Technologies**   
Use of design, images, graphics or technologies associated with the University of Virginia Web site (www.virginia.edu) is prohibited. Images in use on the University Home Page are under limited-use agreements with photographers and some images are the property of the University Relations Office. For inquiries, email: [Webmaster@virginia.edu](mailto:webmaster@virginia.edu). Technologies found on the University of Virginia's main site are not to be edited or copied for private or departmental use. These technologies, including the Interactive Flash Map, are considered intellectual property.

**Viewing Our Site**  
The University of Virginia Web site is designed for best-case viewing on multiple platforms, back to 3.0 Internet Explorer and Netscape.

The look of the University Home Page may vary slightly according to your monitor's setting for color and default font. The U.Va. Home Page and immediate second-level pages use Verdana as the standard font for content viewing. Graphics and images that use additional fonts were created with best-case and worst-case viewing scenarios in mind and all images have been optimized for faster download. 

In support of equal access and widespread use of the University site, we have provided document tags and other supporting data for those using expanded browser and viewing technologies. In addition, a [text-only](http://www.virginia.edu/virginia/text/) version of the Home Page has been maintained since 2001.

**Awards/Recognition**  
• In April 2002, the University was named one of four winners for HomePage design and implementation by the national Association of Educational Publishers.

• In January 2002, the University of Virginia's Home Page won an Award of Excellence in CASE's District III competition for Best Design and Implementation of a Home Page.

• In 2001, it won the Grand Prize in CASE's District III competition for Best Design and Implementation of a Home Page and in 2000, the Home Page had won Special Merit in the same competition.
