We collect your location based information for the purpose of notifying you of athletic or entertainment events that will occur in your area. You may opt-out of location based services at any time by editing the setting at the device level. 

We use mobile analytics software to allow us to better understand the functionality of our Mobile Software on your phone.

### How do you protect my personal and account information?

We use Secure Socket Layers ("SSL") encryption technology where your personal and account information is required (such as a credit card number).

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however.
