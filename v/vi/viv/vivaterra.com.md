What information does VivaTerra collect?

When you visit our web site, our web server automatically recognizes the domain name and e-mail address (where possible). We collect the domain of visitors to our web site, the e-mail address of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate and user-specific information on which pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

Why do we collect this information?

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our web site and to customize the content and/or layout of our pages for each individual consumer.

Will you be contacted by VivaTerra?

If you supply us with your e-mail or postal address online, you may receive periodic e-mails or postal mailings from us with information on new products, services and upcoming events. You may opt out from receiving e-mails or postal communications at any time. If you order from us, we may contact you with questions about your order and/or ordering experience. We use third party companies to help us provide our products and services to you. Some of these companies are given access to some, or all, of the information you provide to us and may use cookies on our behalf. These companies are contractually restricted from using your information in any manner, other than in helping us to provide you with the products and services available on our site. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or postal mail from us, please refer to the information below to contact us.

What does VivaTerra do with information about my gift recipients?

We collect contact information for gift recipients to ensure correct gift delivery. While we do not share any contact information for gift recipients outside of VivaTerra, they may, from time to time, receive offers from us about new features, products or services which we think they will find interesting. Gift recipients are always able to opt out of receiving future mailings.

Does VivaTerra share customer lists?

From time to time, we make our customer postal address lists available to other reputable organizations whose products or services we think you may find interesting. If you do not want us to share your postal address with other companies, please refer to the information below to contact us. We do not share e-mail addresses.

What happens when I create an account with VivaTerra?

You do not have to create an account or register to place an order, request a catalog, or browse the web site. If you want to save address information for the next time you visit or place an order, we need to identify your information through account and/or registration information. If you choose to create an account, you will be requested to select a user name and password. Our web server will recognize registered users when they return to the web site and prompt them to "sign in" (if you are using the same computer that you used to create your account). The information needed to help our server recognize a registered user is stored in a "cookie" on your computer. Cookies do not have the ability to search your computer for other information or transmit information to any other location.

Is my credit card and personal information safe?

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of our customers' personal information, including credit cards and passwords. We guarantee that every online transaction you make will be 100% safe. This means you pay nothing if unauthorized charges are made to your card as a result of shopping at vivaterra.com. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act, your bank cannot hold you liable for more than $50.00 of fraudulent charges. If your bank does hold you liable for any of this $50.00, we will cover the entire liability for you, up to the full $50.00. We will only cover this liability if the unauthorized use of your credit card resulted through no fault of your own from purchases made while using the secure server. In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.

What happens if VivaTerra is sold?

If we are acquired by another company, or a significant portion of our assets is sold to another company, all of the customer information that we have collected may be transferred to the new company. This would include both financial records and consumer information.
