### Pre-Ship Visual Inspection

Your print is visually inspected by our quality control department before it is shipped, to ensure you receive a high-quality print. This is a manual process, not performed by machines. We believe in delivering quality! 

### Special Quality Notice

During the photo upload and configuration process, you may be alerted that your uploaded photo is not big enough to produce a very high quality print in the size you have selected. You will be given an option to select a smaller size, or proceed anyway. If you choose to proceed anyway, accepting that your print may be of reduced quality, VivyxPrinting.com does not guarantee the quality of the resulting print and will not refund or reprint the order! 

### How to Request a Reprint or Refund
