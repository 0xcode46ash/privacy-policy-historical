_**VIVE's Privacy Philosophy**_

VIVE Synergies Inc. is committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.vive.com. 

_****__****_

_**  
Information that VIVE Gathers  
**_

VIVE gathers two types of information about users:

(1) **Personal data** **provided through voluntary registration.** Personal data may be requested when you sign up for VIVE's personalized services or register for contests or other promotional programs offered on our service. We ask for this information in order to enhance your experience on our web site. This information might include member name, password, age, gender, ZIP code and/or country information. Except as described below, this information is not disclosed to parties other than VIVE in any way that personally identifies you without your prior permission.

(2) **Aggregated data which tracks users as a whole.** Aggregated data tracks VIVE user activity in general, and is not used to identify you personally. Aggregated tracking information helps us to determine which areas of our site users like and do not like based on traffic to those areas. VIVE does not track what you read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This data helps us to continue to deliver a better service for you. We may disclose such aggregated information to third parties such as our advertisers and partners.

**  
_How VIVE Uses Information_**

**_  
_** VIVE does not collect personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide such information on a voluntary basis. VIVE uses any personal information that's voluntarily given by you in order to enhance your experience, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users. VIVE also uses information that you voluntarily provide in order to send electronic updates and to let you participate in polls and message boards.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the message boards on the VIVE site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of VIVE.

VIVE will not disclose any information that personally identifies you to parties other than VIVE without your consent. There are exceptions:

  
1) When the purpose and manner of disclosure is clearly defined in advance.  
2) When we believe in good faith that disclosure is legally required or to protect our rights.

**  
_Cookies and Tracking_ _  
_**

You should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of VIVE's Internet servers or through the use of "cookies". A "cookie" is a small text file that a web site can use to recognize repeat users, facilitate you ongoing access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and target advertising. Web sites commonly write a cookie to your hard drive when you visit them. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the user that has no meaning outside the assigning site. Cookies don't identify you personally, but rather identify your computer when you visit our site. A cookie cannot read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

You should be aware that VIVE cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties hosting data for VIVE.

If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the user to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features (e.g., customized account features) available on the VIVE site.

VIVE uses cookies as a way to measure activity on the site in order to continually improve your experience. Generally, we use cookies to:

(1) Remind us of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver to you a better and more personalized service. VIVE also uses cookies to store your zip code for other services.

(2) Estimate the size of VIVE's audience. Each browser accessing VIVE is given a unique cookie which is then used to determine the extent of repeat usage, and to help target advertisements based on user interests and behavior.

(3) Track your progress and number of entries in some of our promotions and contests. When a VIVE-hosted promotion uses cookies, the information written to the cookie indicates the player's progress through the promotion, and may be used to track entries, submissions, and status in contests.

(4) Measure certain traffic patterns, which areas of VIVE's network of web sites you have visited, and your visiting patterns in the aggregate. We use this research to understand how our users' habits are similar or different from one another so that we can enhance your experience on the VIVE web site. We may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you and other users will see on our sites.

Advertising networks that serve ads onto VIVE may also use their own cookies.

VIVE also collects [IP addresses](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html) for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. In addition, VIVE Mail includes IP addresses in outgoing mail message headers.

_VIVE Content Providers, Advertisers and Partners_**

VIVE will not provide your personal information to anyone outside of VIVE except in the limited circumstances mentioned, and only then with your consent. However, VIVE cannot control the practices of third parties, such as other partners and advertisers. VIVE is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. 

It is important to note that VIVE contains many links to sites other than VIVE, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as VIVE. This includes links from advertisers, content providers and partners who may use VIVE's logo and/or style as part of a co-branding agreement. These sites may send their own cookies to you, and as a result, may collect data and ask for personal information that VIVE would not. You should be aware that VIVE cannot control the use of cookies or the resulting information by advertisers or third parties.

**_Kids and Privacy_**

**_  
_** VIVE requests that children under 17 do not submit or post any information to the site without the consent of a parent or guardian. However, we will not request or knowingly collect from a child any information online that can be traced to the child, such as an email address, name, or information about the child's family. Unless a parent or guardian consents to such use in advance, VIVE will not knowingly use information that a child provides to VIVE for any marketing, selling or promotional purposes.
