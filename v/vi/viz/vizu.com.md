USE BY CHILDREN UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE PROHIBITED  
Our Site is intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. All persons under 13 years of age are prohibited from registering on our Site. All persons between the ages of 13 and 18 must have a parent assist in the completion of registration on our Site. 

WHAT INFORMATION DOES VIZU GATHER?  
The choice of how much personally identifiable information you disclose to us is completely at your discretion. Some areas of our Site are accessible without registration of any kind. This is true of many of the basic content areas on our Site. Other areas of our Site require registration in order for you to participate in the services offered. It is not mandatory for you to register and provide information to us, but please realize that in order for us to serve you better, you will need to provide certain information to access some areas of our Site, to obtain or register for the specialized services we provide, or to complete transactions that you initiate on our Site. If you choose not to provide information, we may not be able to permit access to such areas, provide those specialized services, or complete such transactions. A user's email address and other personally identifiable information collected are used only as described in this Privacy Policy and, unless opted-out, for the purposes of offering you goods and services that, in the sole discretion of Vizu and its affiliates, you may find interesting or of use. By providing such information, you consent to Vizu's Privacy Policy, including the collection and uses of the information described in this policy. 

  * Information gathered through registration, login, and participation in Vizu polls or other services:  
Registration is required to enable access to some features, functionality, and information on the Site, to send you specific information related to your service, to allow you to access stored information, and in the event that you do not opt-out, to provide third party access to you. When registering on Vizu you may need to provide your full name and email address, along with other personally identifiable information that may be voluntarily provided. You will also need to select a username and password for your account.  Also, we may collect information that identifies you personally when you send us comments, questions or suggestions. From time-to-time we may post contests or sweepstakes on our Site, which may request demographic information and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to participate and disclose information. 
  * Communication Features:  
Our users also have the option of forwarding some of our content to friends, colleagues or acquaintances (Contacts) through such features as our email and IM capabilities.  If a user elects to use our communication features, we ask them for the required contact information (e.g. email address or IM address).  Vizu stores this information for the sole purpose of sending these messages only; we will not use this information for other purposes unless the Contacts registers on our Site. Contacts may contact Vizu at   to request the removal of this information from our database. 
  * Information gathered through traffic monitoring  
Like many other Web sites, our Site is equipped with a program that monitors traffic by automatically logging information such as visitor's host, domain name, pages visited, length of user sessions, browser type and/or IP address. This program tracks the number of times the Site is hit, how many visitors come to the Site, which parts of the Site they frequent, and the length of time of each visit. Please note that if you have registered with us, this information may contain personally identifiable information, and is used to evaluate areas of interest and to improve the Vizu site and may be provided to third parties by Vizu or its affiliates. In addition to log information, we may use a variety of technologies to create a more personalized experience for our users. A cookie is a small text file placed on a user's computer when a user visits a Web site. The cookie gives the user a unique, random ID, and this ID enables our Site to readily recognize each visitor on a subsequent visit to the Site. For example, a cookie may indicate the preferences selected by a visitor on a prior visit, and facilitate more efficient browsing on subsequent visits by using such preferences to customize the content and/or layout of our Site for the visitor. Vizu may use cookies. Users are free to change their web browsers to prevent the acceptance of cookies. However, subscribers of Vizu must enable cookies to access member areas. Vizu's cookies may contain personally identifiable information collected by Vizu. Pixel tags are tiny graphic files that are included in HTML-encoded e-mail messages. We may use pixel tags to gather information about the e-mails we send to our registered users and to recipients of referral messages. When such a message is opened in an HTML-capable e-mail program, the recipient's computer accesses our server to retrieve the pixel tag file, and allows us to record and store the date and time, the recipient's e-mail address, and other standard logging information. The pixel tag also may read cookies. Our web pages may also contain similar pixel tags that allow us to count users who have visited those pages, to compile aggregated statistics about Site usage, and to deliver co-branded services as they become available. Our pixel tags collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the pixel tag resides. Our web pages may also contain pixel tags placed there by third party ad servers, to monitor the effectiveness of their advertising. [Top](http://www.vizu.com/policy.html#policy_top)

Vizu provides, for the convenience of our users, the opportunity to link to Web sites of organizations not related to Vizu, Inc. If you click on a hypertext link that takes you to a Web site outside of Vizu, we are not responsible for their privacy policies or information collection practices and uses. In addition, when you initiate a transaction with one of our suppliers or selected vendors through Vizu, the information that you and we submit to the supplier or selected vendor for the transaction becomes subject to the supplier or selected vendor's privacy or information use policies.

Our Site may provide links to third party websites, which may, or may not, use cookies, pixel tags and web tags. We also may allow other companies, called third-party ad servers, to display advertisements on our Site. Ad servers may also use these tools to compile information about where users saw particular advertisements, and to determine which ads were clicked on. We are not responsible for, or have any control over, the privacy policies of those third party websites and ad servers, and encourage all users to read the privacy policies of each and every website visited when linking directly from our Site.
