# VIZ, LLC . privacy policy

At **viz.com** , we intend to give you as much control as possible over your personal information, including the Registration Data. We will let each user know how we will use the personal information derived from each user's access to and use of **viz.com** and/or the Services.

**NOTICE**

**viz.com** will track the domains from which people visit **viz.com** and analyze this data for trends and statistics. Subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy, different **viz.com** sites may use accumulated data for different purposes, including but not limited to marketing analysis, service evaluation and planning.

**viz.com** contains links to other websites, whether owned or controlled by **viz.com** affiliates or unrelated third parties. **viz.com** is not responsible for the privacy policies and practices of any linked website.

Currently, **viz.com** uses personal information as a basis for notifications to users, mailing list emails, and in order to implement the terms of the Terms of Service governing the website (the "TOS"). User names and email addresses (as well as any additional information that a user may choose to post) may be publicly available on the **viz.com** site, unless a user elects to "opt-out" of such display of personal information.

Subject to the foregoing, **viz.com** may conduct surveys or other studies of its customer base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, **viz.com** will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where **viz.com** advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, **viz.com** reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is disclosed.

**viz.com** contains content of licensed intellectual properties used in multimedia presentation with use of plug-ins from the user's preferred internet application. Examples of these multimedia presentations are the Dragonball FLASH manga and the VIZ manga reader, which uses the MACROMEDIA FLASH plug in.

**CHOICE**

Cookies: **viz.com** employs "cookies" to provide a user with tailored information. A "cookie" is an element of data which a Service or site, when visited by a user, sends to that user's browser which, in turn, may store that element on the user's hard drive or memory. **viz.com** uses cookies to better serve users who use our Services; any cookies sent by **viz.com** will be marked so that they will only be accessible by websites subject to this Privacy Policy. However, at his or her option and at his or her sole expense and responsibility, any user may block or delete our cookies from his or her hard drive. However, by disabling cookies, certain site features and functionality may no longer work properly, or at all.

"Opt-out" Emails: Users may receive site notifications, newsletters or other information via email. Users may remove themselves from such services at their discretion. Any email sent to an "opt-out" list will include directions for how a user may remove him or herself from the list, or a URL where the user may find such directions.

Other Notification: In order to implement or enforce the Terms of Service of the relevant **viz.com** site, **viz.com** may use personal information to contact users on an individual basis.

Profile Display: In some cases, users' personal information may be publicly available through a user's profile display. In such cases, users have the option to opt out of publicly displaying their real names. In cases where site profiles allow users to display optional information publicly, such entry and display is at the user's discretion and may be changed at any time by the user.

Email Display: In some cases, users may have the opportunity to use an **viz.com** service to send electronic mail to another user or email list. In such cases, a user's valid email address and real name will be included with such messages. In order to prevent abuse, users may not opt-out of such a display, but may choose to refrain from using said Service to transmit an email message.

General: In cases where users voluntarily and publicly disclose personal information which may contain their Registration Data or otherwise post personal information, such personal information necessarily will no longer be considered covered under this Privacy Policy. An example of such a disclosure includes, but is not limited to, a user's disclosure of personal information as part of a message posted to a public message forum.

At no time, unless such disclosure is required by law, will **viz.com** disclose individual user personal information that is not publicly available to unrelated third parties.

Surveys and Resulting Information: Subject to the foregoing, **viz.com** may conduct surveys or other studies of its customer base and usage for marketing and planning purposes. Participation in such surveys is at the user's option; **viz.com** does not conduct mandatory surveys.

With respect to information collected from such surveys or studies, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey and **viz.com** will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific individual. Circumstances under which **viz.com** would publicly disclose such aggregate information include, but are not limited to, sharing survey results with the site population, providing data to **viz.com** advertisers on user preferences and/or demographics, and publicizing overall usage data in press communications.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments, and where **viz.com** advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, **viz.com** reserves the right to disclose text information provided by any user through such a survey, provided that no personal information identifying that user is disclosed.

**SECURITY**

To secure site integrity, **viz.com** employs measures including but not limited to security audits, use of encryption tools and software, and other reasonable security measures and procedures. Internal access to users' private and nonpublic personal information is restricted to site administrators and individuals on a need-to-know basis.

**ENFORCEMENT**

In the event that **viz.com** becomes aware that site security is compromised or user nonpublic information has been disclosed to unrelated third parties as a result of external activity, including but not limited to external security attacks, **viz.com** shall take reasonable measures which it deems appropriate, including but not limited to internal investigation and reporting, and notification to and cooperation with law enforcement authorities.

If **viz.com** becomes aware that a user's personal information provided to **viz.com** has been disclosed in a manner not permitted by this Privacy Policy, **viz.com** shall make reasonable efforts to notify the affected user, as soon as reasonably possible and as permitted by law, of what information has been disclosed, to the extent that **viz.com** knows this information.

Concurrently with any change to the core privacy policy, we will email notice of the change to known users at least 30 days (or such shorter or longer time as mandated by law or any judicial or government body ) in advance.
