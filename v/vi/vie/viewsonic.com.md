**Newly Discontinued "A" Stock and Refurbished Products**

**WHAT IS A NEWLY DISCONTINUED "A" STOCK PRODUCT?**  
Our Newly Discontinued "A" Stock products meet "new product specifications." These products have not been sold prior to your purchase, but are being phased out for new incoming product. 

**WHAT IS A REFURBISHED PRODUCT?**  
Our refurbished products include evaluation units, customer return units, and cosmetically imperfect units. These products are retested and determined to meet ViewSonic's quality standards before they are sold as refurbished units. Performance may be slightly below performance of a new ViewSonic unit.

**Tax Information**

The Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA), signed into law on October 21, 1998, was primarily intended to prevent state and local governments from imposing new or discriminatory taxes on Internet transactions and on Internet access. Despite its name, ITFA does NOT keep state and local governments from imposing existing sales tax collection requirements on companies selling over the Internet.

As a result, companies selling over the Internet are subject to the same sales tax collection requirements as any other retailers, and are generally required to collect taxes when they ship a product to a destination in a state where they have a physical selling presence. In the United States, ViewSonic has a physical sales presence in AZ, CA, FL, GA, IL, IN, MA, MD, MI, MN, NJ, NV, NY, OH, TX, and WA; as required by law, we charge sales taxes on deliveries to these states, as well as a California Recycling Fee for products shipped to California customers. 

Appropriate taxes and duties are applied for all shipments and are automatically calculated for the customer when they place their order. Customer is responsible for all taxes and duties.

It encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name and address so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
