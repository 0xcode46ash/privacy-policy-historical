Communications to Non-members

When members choose to use Vindale Research's Invite-a-Friend service, the member is prompted to input their friend's email address. Vindale Research will automatically send an email to that address with a message inviting the recipient to join the Vindale Research community. Vindale Research stores these email addresses for the purpose of automatically adding the invitee to the member's friend list upon signing up. Vindale Research will not send more than one follow up email to an invitee for any given peer referral. Should the invitee explicitly decline to join Vindale Research and opt out of receiving any future emails, Vindale Research will cease to send the receiver any future emails, even if additional peer referrals are given.
