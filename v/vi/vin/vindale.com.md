Information collected and used by Vindale Research

Vindale Research collects user-submitted information including name, email address, and age to verify new accounts and send notifications regarding Vindale Research's services. Vindale Research collects additional optional data that is included in member profiles. This data includes but is not limited to: occupation, interests, school affiliations, gender, and address. 

We also collect non-personally identifiable information including IP address and browser type to help run the site more efficiently. 

Use of information members submit to Vindale Research

Email addresses are used to send notifications related to the service(s) the user has signed up for, as a confirmation when a Vindale Research member has requested to add another member as a friend, and to invite new friends to join Vindale Research. A user may choose to stop receiving email notifications from Vindale Research at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of the email. When the user sends email or other communication to Vindale Research, Vindale Research may retain those communications in order to process the user's inquiries, respond to the user's requests and improve Vindale Research's services. 

Vindale Research provides members with the opportunity to upload a self-portrait and/or testimonial of our service. We will preserve your privacy, but reserve the right to use your first name, last initial, city and state for our testimonials. We will not release your contact information in these testimonials. If you would like to email us your feedback or testimonial but would like it to remain confidential, please express your intention clearly when you submit your photo and/or testimonial. The specific use of a user's personal information will be defined at the point of collection. Should Vindale Research wish to change anything regarding the use of a user's personal information, a prominent notice will be displayed on the website. 

Use of non-personally identifiable information

Vindale Research uses your IP address and browser type for the general administration of the website. Demographic information you provide such as age, postal code, gender and country of residence may be used to target surveys, advertisements and special offers. In cases where advertisements are being displayed by a third-party, non-personally identifiable information may be passed to the third-party to allow for targeting. 

Sharing of collected information with third parties

Except in cases where members are expressly informed otherwise, Vindale Research does not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of your personal information unless required by law to do so. In certain circumstances, Vindale Research may share profile information and aggregate usage information in a non-personally identifiable fashion to advertisers or other third parties for the purpose of delivering more targeted advertising, products and services to members. In these instances Vindale Research will only disclose information that will be used to personally identify you if you grant permission through an opt-in process. Vindale Research reserves the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to that information as a result of the sale of Vindale Research or substantially all of its assets to that successor in interest. 

Communications to Non-members

When members choose to use Vindale Research's Invite-a-Friend service, the member is prompted to input their friend's email address. Vindale Research will automatically send an email to that address with a message inviting the recipient to join the Vindale Research community. Vindale Research stores these email addresses for the purpose of automatically adding the invitee to the member's friend list upon signing up. Vindale Research will not send more than one follow up email to an invitee for any given peer referral. Should the invitee explicitly decline to join Vindale Research and opt out of receiving any future emails, Vindale Research will cease to send the receiver any future emails, even if additional peer referrals are given.
