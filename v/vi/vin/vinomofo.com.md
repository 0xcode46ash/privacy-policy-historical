# Our Privacy Policy - Vinomofo

Welcome to the _Mega Menu._ Not dissimilar to the non-mega menu you just clicked from, itâ€™s true. For now. But soon, it will grow truly mega, and the world will know why this is called the **Mega Menu.** Be afraid. 

Note from the founders:

> We'd just like to apologise for the formal and legal tone of our privacy policy, but it's required with stricter new privacy laws, which is good for everyone, really. Just know that basically, we're a members-only site, we look after our members, and that means we respect your privacy, we don't share your information with other parties, and we don't spam people. We try to do good. But here's the formal stuff that you might like to know...
