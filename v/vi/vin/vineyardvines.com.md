Shipping Costs are based on order merchandise total costs and the selected shipping method:

Merchandise Total | Standard Ground | Two-Day | Next Day  
---|---|---|---  
Please note that larger items, such as the Yeti Cooler, cost more to ship.  
$0-$50 | $8.50 | $18.50 | $26.50  
$50.01-$100 | $10 | $20 | $28  
$100.01-$124.99 | $12 | $22 | $30  
$125+ | FREE | $24 | $32  
  
We strive to process orders as quickly as we possibly can. Orders placed Monday through Friday are usually shipped within 48 hours. **Please note that during periods of high volume, it will take longer (sales, major promotions, Friends & Family, during the holidays, etc.)** Orders placed over the weekend are usually shipped Monday. If you need your order to go out the same day you place it, please place your order before noon ET using an expedited service (excludes Saturday, Sunday and Holidays) and we’ll be sure to do our best to get you your merchandise in time.

Once processed, orders are shipped via UPS Ground (unless an expedited UPS service is chosen). UPS Ground is delivered within 5-7 business days to most U.S. locations; however, we've found that orders will arrive even sooner than that.

Once an order has shipped, you will receive an email with tracking information. This email might wind up in your "Spam" email folder, so be sure to add vineyard vines to your "safe" list.

We apologize, but we cannot make changes, adjustments, or cancellations to an order after it has been submitted. We may still be able to help, though! Just give us a call at 800-892-4982.

Absolutely! When you set up your vineyard vines account, you’re able to enter separate shipping addresses and save addresses that you may want to ship to in the future.

You may have ordered a number of items that don’t fit into one box, or we are shipping your item from one of our store locations. You will receive an email with a tracking number and item list for each of your packages.

Please note, in order to fulfill your order to the best of our ability we sometimes ship your items directly from one of our stores which can result in multiple shipments for a single order. When this happens you may notice multiple posts to your credit card for a single order. The initial authorization is not a charge and will disappear from your account in a business day or so.

Since this is a large and heavy item, our shipping provider charges more for us to ship this to you.
