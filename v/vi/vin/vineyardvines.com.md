All vineyardvines.com orders will be accepted and fully processed in and shipped from the United States and all information you provide will be securely maintained in our Web server and internal systems located within the United States. We may occasionally share our postal and email lists, as well as your shopping history (but not your credit card information), with third parties whose products or services may be of interest to you and who have their own privacy policy in place. If you do not want us to share your personal information with these third parties, you may opt-out by emailing us at [privacy@vineyardvines.com](mailto:privacy@vineyardvines.com).

In the event of a sale or merger of vineyard vines our customer's personal information may be shared with the merged or purchasing entity. You should also be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if required to do so by law, governmental request or court order or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with such law, request or court order or to protect the users of our website or the public.

**Links to other sites**

To enhance your shopping experience, the Sites may have links to other sites. Those Web sites will have their own policies on privacy that you may wish to review. vineyard vines has no responsibility for these linked Web sites.

**Cookies**

We use cookies to recognize you and your preferences to make shopping easier and provide you with a customized experience on our website. Cookies are bits of information that we automatically store on your computer if your computer accepts cookies. Cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information such as your name, address or any financial information on your computer. Vineyard Vines places a unique user ID number on your cookie which allows us to access information that will improve your shopping experience - such as holding items in your shopping bag, accessing your address book, or providing you with customized pages based on your past viewing or purchasing preferences. We also use cookies to track traffic to different parts of the website in order to make improvements and optimize your shopping experience.

If you do not wish to have a cookie on your system, you can set your browser preferences to refuse them. In order to disable cookies, please consult your browser's help section for instructions.

**Advertising**

We participate in interest-based or behavioral advertising. This means that you may receive communications, special promotions, and see advertising on the Sites or other websites tailored to how you browse or shop at our stores, on the Sites or other websites. You may also see advertising for Vineyard Vines on other advertising on other websites based on your particular interests and online activity on the Sites or other websites. You have the choice to tell us not to collect and use this information.

**Do not track**

Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, vineyard vines and the Sites do not recognize DNT.

If you choose to give us your telephone number on the order form, it is for the purpose of contacting you regarding your order. We will not call you regarding promotions.

**Privacy for children**

vineyard vines® is concerned about the privacy of young children and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from a child under 13. vineyard vines® does not sell products for purchase by children, and all children's products we sell are for purchase by adults only. If vineyard vines learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personally identifiable information online without parental consent, it will take all reasonable measures to delete such information from its databases and to not use such information for any purpose (except where necessary to protect the safety of the child or others as required or allowed by law). If you become aware of any personally identifiable information we have collected from children under 13, please contact us at [tieguys@vineyardvines.com](mailto:tieguys@vineyardvines.com) or by calling 1-800-892-4982. 

**Security**

The security of your information is very important to us. We use industry-standard security techniques to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information collected from you at the Sites. When you access your account information or transmit personally identifiable data to the Sites, that information is stored on servers that the Sites have attempted to secure from unauthorized access or intrusion. We use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to protect the security of your online order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than vineyard vines®

Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:

  * The "http" in the web address will be replaced by "https"
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section for the browser window.
  * Only browsers that use the 128-bit Secure Socket Layer technology are able to order through the Vineyard Vines web site. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft's or Netscape's home page.



While we implement these and other security measures on this site, please note that 100% security is not always possible.
