Videowish.Com ( collectively "our website" , "our websites" , "website services ) 

We will not collect any personal or business information, nor store or share that information with any third party without your express permission. 

### _Information_

When you visit our site you will receive explicit advice when we seek to gather information about you. The information you provide is used to produce your web page and any information you supply is displayed to the public on this page, unless otherwise stated. 

### _User Registration_

The information harvested during the registration process is used to create your own unique identification as a site visitor/services user and enable us to undertake the various administration processes necessary. 

### _Your Information_

The information we collect about you or your business enables us to: 

  * understand your needs 
  * improve our service to you 
  * stay in touch with you through other media as you require 
  * enhance and refine existing information we may have acquired from other sources 
  * complete the internal administration necessary to register you and maintain our service to you 



### _How do you know if we are gathering Information?_

Detailed information about you is only collected when you are advised explicitly that is what we are doing and you supply it voluntarily. 

### _Sharing Information_

Our website does not share your information with any sub-contractors or third parties. We do however encourage you to look at the privacy statements of our billing agents, Paycom and CCBill. 

### _Legal Disclosure_

When approached by the appropriate authorities, information about you, your business or account usage may be disclosed but only when legally required under European Law. 

### _Payment Encryption Technology_

To maintain the highest security we use the services of Paycom and CCBill, both very technologically advanced billing agents who use state-of-the-art 128 bit encyption techniques. 

### _Hackers and Viruses_

Your registration details are very important - please keep your password and member name secret. It is better for other users to register separately than to share your account access information. We will never write to ask for your login details - be cautious of anyone asking for this information. 

### _Automated Collection of Other Information_

Some non-personal information may be collected automatically, such as the computer operating system and the type of browser software you are using, along with special codes that tell us which pages you have visited. Some information is stored in the form of a 'cookie', a small file which remains on your computer but which acts as a reminder about any preferences you have selected when visiting our sites. We only use 'cookies' to improve our service to you. We may also store your log in details on your computer, but only if you explicitly request us to do so. Remember that if you opt for us to do this, any other user of the same computer can access your account. 

### _Changes to our Privacy Policy_

We reserve the right to change this statement at any time without warning to meet any statutory requirements or changes in the nature of our activities and services. This privacy statement does not form the basis of any contract between any party. 

### _Protect your Privacy_

We caution you against giving out personally identifiable information (such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, names and addresses, driver license numbers, passwords) to strangers online, which may be used for illegal or harmful purposes.
