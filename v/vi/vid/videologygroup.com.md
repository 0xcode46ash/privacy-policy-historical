**What this privacy policy covers**

This policy covers how TidalTV treats information that TidalTV collects and receives through our services, which include TidalTV's video advertising and ad targeting solutions and any other technology, products and/or services offered by TidalTV (collectively referred to as the 'Services'), including your past use of the Services. For more information about our Services, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20111225181146id_/http%3A//www.tidaltv.com/index.html). 

This policy does not apply to information about you collected by TidalTV's third party advertisers and publishers, or other third parties linked to or otherwise accessible via the Services. The information collected or received by any such providers and third parties is subject to their own privacy policies.

**Collection and Use of Information**

**Personal Information**

TidalTV does not require you to provide personal information in order to use many of the Services. Personal information is information that personally identifies you, such as name, street address and email address. On some pages of TidalTV's web sites, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as when submitting a request for a media kit or requesting that TidalTV contact you. Additionally, if you enter into a business relationship with TidalTV, we may require that you provide us with personal information for administrative purposes, such as maintaining account information, preparing invoices and issuing payment. If you do provide us with personal information, your information shall only be used for the purpose for which it is submitted. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

When you visit a web site that uses our video advertising solution and view an advertisement that we've served to that site, TidalTV uses cookies and other technologies to record and store anonymous information about your interaction with the Services, most commonly known as 'click-stream data'. Click-stream data can include information such as IP address, date/time of visit, browser type, web pages visited and information on your interaction with the Services, including whether you interacted with the advertisement (e.g., viewed the ad to completion or clicked on the ad), and what content you viewed. For more detailed information on cookies and web beacons, please see our [FAQs](https://web.archive.org/web/20111225181146id_/http%3A//www.tidaltv.com/faq.html) . 

In order to optimize the effectiveness of the Services for our clients, we supplement the click-stream data we collect with non-personally-identifiable behavioral and demographic data from third party data providers, publishers and other partners we work with. This anonymous data may include such things as zip code, age, gender and income range. 

**Use and Disclosure**

TidalTV uses non-personal information it receives and collects to customize, target, and measure the effectiveness of the advertisements we deliver to you via the Service (including targeted advertising based on demographic characteristics, viewing preferences and behaviors), to prevent showing you the same ads repeatedly, and to predict the characteristics and preferences of the audience on sites that use our video advertising solution in order to assist advertisers in targeting their campaigns to the most relevant Internet audience. 

TidalTV uses personal information you provide to us to communicate with and respond to your inquiries, to conduct research about use of the Services; to fulfill your requests for products and services; to help offer you other products, services or offerings that may be of interest to you; and to provide anonymous internal and external reporting. If you choose to provide us with personal information including your email address, we will not use your email address to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of important changes to the Services or for customer service purposes). 

TidalTV will not rent, sell or share information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies, except to provide the Services, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

  


>   * We will provide your information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with TidalTV under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help TidalTV fulfill a transaction you requested or communicate with you about offers from TidalTV and our marketing partners. However, unless you have granted permission, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
>   
> 
>   * We work with third party vendors, partners, advertisers, publishers, demographic and behavioral data providers and other service and content providers. In order to optimize the Services and to better target advertisements, we may share information about you with them, including statistical and demographic data about our users and their use of the Services. We will not authorize these third party providers to share your information other than as necessary to provide the Services and to enhance user experience through targeting of ads. 
>   
> 
>   * If TidalTV, or part(s) of TidalTV, is acquired or merged with another company we will transfer information about you to the acquiring company. 
>   
> 
>   * Finally, TidalTV may share information on individuals it deems necessary to comply with a subpoena or court order, to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or to cooperate with government and law enforcement officials. 
> 


**Third Party Service Providers**

TidalTV and its advertisers may use third party ad networks and technology providers to help present advertisements via the Services. These third party providers may also use cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer to collect click-stream data. The use of cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies by such third-party providers is subject to their own privacy policies, not TidalTV's. Please contact them directly for information about their privacy practices. In addition, the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) offers useful information about ad networks, including information about how to opt-out of their information collection. 

**Access To and Choices About Your Information - Opting Out and Reviewing Your Ad Preferences**

**Cookie Opt-Out & Reviewing Your Ad Preferences**

TidalTV believes users should have information necessary to make informed decisions and the right to choose how their information is used.

**Security**

Consistent with industry standards, TidalTV has established reasonable safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access to, disclosure, alteration or misuse of your information, but cannot guarantee that your data will never be disclosed in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy (for example, as a result of unauthorized acts by third parties that violate applicable law or TidalTV's policies). All data stored on TidalTV's servers is treated as confidential. Our employees are aware of the confidential nature of such data and have limited access to it.
