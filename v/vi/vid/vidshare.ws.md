In addition, the following describes privacy practices specific to vidshare. To understand how we treat the information you give us as you use vidshare, you should read this policy.  
Personal Information

  * Non-Account Activity. You can watch videos on vidshare without having a vidshare Account.


  * Account-Related Activity. Certain other activities on vidshare like uploading videos, posting comments, or watching restricted videos require you to have a vidshare Account. We ask for some personal information when you create a vidshare Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access.


  * Usage Information. We may record information about your usage, such as when you use vidshare, the channels, groups, and favorites you subscribe to, the contacts you communicate with, and the frequency and size of data transfers, as well as information you display or click on in vidshare (including UI elements, settings, and other information). If you are logged in, we may associate that information with your account.


  * Content Uploaded to Site. Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose on the vidshare site becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.



 **Uses**

  * If you submit personally identifiable information to us through the vidshare Site, we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the vidshare Site, as well as provide special personalized features to you.


  * Your account name (not your email address) is displayed to other Users when you upload videos or send messages through the vidshare Site and other Users can contact you through messages and comments. Any videos that you submit to the vidshare Site may be redistributed through the internet and other media channels, and may be viewed by the general public.


  * We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major vidshare Site changes or for customer service purposes).


  * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the vidshare Sites and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing User preferences and trends.


  * We use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the vidshare Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.



 **Your Choices**

  * You may, of course, decline to submit personally identifiable information through the vidshare Sites, in which case you can still view videos and explore the vidshare Sites, but vidshare may not be able to provide certain services to you. The privacy notices of those services govern the use of your personal information associated with them.


  * You may update or correct your personal profile information and email preferences at any time by visiting your account profile page.
