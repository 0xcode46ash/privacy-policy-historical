# Privacy Policy | Vidyard

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Buildscale, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as "Buildscale") uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy") applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this website (vidyard.com, the "Vidyard Site"), any Buildscale computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Vidyard Site ("Vidyard Software") and any Buildscale services purchased or otherwise made available from the Vidyard Site ("Buildscale Services") (collectively, the "Vidyard Properties"). This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") applies to all Users ("Users") of the Vidyard Properties. 

  


### A. WHAT INFORMATION BUILDSCALE COLLECTS FROM YOU

Buildscale may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal. 

1\. "Personal Information." Personal Information refers to information that lets Buildscale know the specifics of who you are and which may be used to identify, contact or locate you (e.g. name, mailing address, telephone number and e-mail address). Buildscale may collect Personal Information when you use the Vidyard Properties including, without limitation, setting up account information, filling out surveys, corresponding with Buildscale, or otherwise volunteering information about yourself.

2\. "Non-Personal Information." Non-Personal Information refers to information that, by itself, does not identify you as a specific individual (e.g. demographic information or website visitations). Buildscale may collect Non-Personal Information through any of the methods discussed above as well as automatically through use of industry standard technologies described further below.

  


### B. HOW BUILDSCALE COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION

The Personal Information practices set forth apply to all Buildscale's customers worldwide.

1\. Registration. Prior to using one or more of the Vidyard Properties, Buildscale may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account ("Account") or to enable features or functionality of the Vidyard Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by Buildscale may prevent access to any or all Vidyard Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Vidyard Properties.

2\. Information Collected Through Technology. While you are able to visit the Vidyard Site and remain anonymous, Buildscale or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Vidyard Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:

(a) Cookies. Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Vidyard Site. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this. Not accepting cookies may make certain features of the Vidyard Properties unavailable to you.

(b) IP Address. You may visit many areas of the Vidyard Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User. Even in such cases, Buildscale may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the Vidyard Site and each time you request one of Buildscale's pages, the server logs your IP address.

(c) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Buildscale may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Buildscale sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.

(d) Tracking Content Usage. If you use the Buildscale Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, "Content") to your website or to a third party website, Buildscale tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.

  


### C. HOW BUILDSCALE USES YOUR INFORMATION

1\. System Administration. Buildscale may use Non-Personal Information for the purposes of system administration, assisting in diagnosing problems with Buildscale servers, monitoring Buildscale's system performance and traffic on the Vidyard Properties and to gather broad demographic information about Buildscale customers.

2\. Personalization. Buildscale uses Cookies and IP Addresses to track features such as delivering Content specific to your interests and informing you of new, relevant services or certain third party offerings.

3\. Notices to Registered Users. If you have registered for an Account, Buildscale may use your Personal Information to send e-mails regarding your registration, including confirmation to verify the accuracy of any information you have provided, and instructions on how to post Content. Buildscale may also send you e-mails to verify your identity or to notify you if Buildscale believes your use of Vidyard Properties violates any applicable agreement for the use of the Vidyard Properties.

4\. Advertising. Buildscale may use Non-Personal Information to assist in optimizing the delivery of advertisements to viewers of your Content.

5\. Promotional E-mails. Buildscale may use your Personal Information to send you e-mails periodically listing promotions or events relating to the Vidyard Properties or from Buildscale's marketing partners or sponsors. You have the choice to opt-out of receiving such promotional e-mails by sending an e-mail to privacy@vidyard.com and/or following the instructions in such correspondence. Once Buildscale's has processed your opt-out request, Buildscale will not send you promotional e-mails unless you opt back in to receiving such communications.

6\. Contact Information. If you contact Buildscale by telephone, e-mail or letter, Buildscale may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence. If you report a problem with the Vidyard Properties, Buildscale may collect this information in a file specific to you. You may contact Buildscale at privacy@vidyard.com to request the removal of this information from Buildscale's database.

  


### D. HOW TO ACCESS AND CHANGE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

Upon request, Buildscale shall allow Users to update or correct Personal Information previously submitted, but only to the extent such activities will not compromise privacy or security interests. Additionally, upon request, Buildscale shall delete Personal Information from the database where such information is stored; however, it may be impossible to entirely delete a User's entry without some residual information being retained due to the manner in which data backups are maintained. Requests to delete Personal Information shall be submitted to help@vidyard.com.

  


### E. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Buildscale does not sell, trade or rent Personal Information collected through the Vidyard Properties to any third party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buildscale shall: (1) fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies; and (2) may be required to disclose Personal Information upon receipt of a court order, subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation.

  


### F. SAFEGUARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

1\. Security Measures. Buildscale takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of Personal Information. These include, but are not limited to, internal reviews of: (a) Buildscale's data collection; (b) storage and processing practices; (c) electronic security measures; and (d) physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where Buildscale stores Personal Information. All Buildscale employees, contractors and agents who access Personal Information are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution or unauthorized use or disclosure of Personal Information.

2\. Third Party Links. The Vidyard Properties may contain links to third parties who may collect Personal Information and Non-Personal Information directly from you. Additionally, Buildscale may use third parties to provide components of the Vidyard Properties. In either case, such third parties may have separate privacy policies and data collection practices, independent of Buildscale. Buildscale: (a) has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions; (b) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites; and (c) does not make any warranties or representations about the contents, products or services offered on such websites or the security of any information you provide to them. 

  


### E. DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES

Buildscale continually strives to implement new technologies and processes to better protect you, your privacy and your use of the Vidyard Properties. As a result, changes to this Privacy Policy may be made by Buildscale from time to time. In no event will these changes result in the degradation of any of the security measures designed to protect you from unauthorized disclosure, as such measures are described in this Privacy Policy.
