## Information Collection and Use

### Information Collection from Video Professor Web Sites

Video Professor is the owner of the information collected on [www.videoprofessor.com](http://www.videoprofessor.com/), videoprofessoronline.com, johnwscherer.com, and all other web sites owned by Video Professor (collectively, "Video Professor Web Sites"). Video Professor collects information from our users at several different points on our Video Professor Web Sites, including our landing pages. 

### Ordering

When you order Video Professor products in any authorized manner, you must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing your order, the information is used to contact you. We may present offers to purchase products from our marketing partners on our site. If you also purchase goods or services from a marketing partner in connection with an offer posted on the Video Professor Web Sites or via other authorized vendors, you authorize us to share your financial information (including your credit card information) with the marketing partner. 

### Information Use

When filling an order, Video Professor uses your personal information to process and review order(s) for our software products. Once you have submitted an order for one of our products, we use your information internally to process your order(s), and to personalize Video Professor mailings based on your interests. Video Professor usually does this through the periodic mailings sent to your postal address (typically along with your product order) or to your e-mail address alerting you of special offers, newsletters, and commercial offerings that may be of interest. In order to provide services that better meet your needs, we also may supplement the information that you provide to us with other information that we receive from third parties. 

### Registration

In order to use certain areas of the Video Professor Web Sites, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information such as name, zip code, and e-mail address. We use this information to contact the user about services on our site that we believe may be of interest. In other areas of the site, such as when registering for the affiliate program or registering as a member or to access an online account, users must provide additional information, which can include full address, a user name, password, web site information, and, in some cases, a social security number or tax identification number so that we can comply with federal laws. Participation in these areas of the site is completely optional. 

### Video Professor Web Sites Profile

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our Video Professor Web Sites users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that details their viewing preferences. Consequently, collected information is tied to the users' personally identifiable information to provide offers and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor users' visits to our Video Professor Web Sites, and to direct pertinent marketing promotions to them. We share your profile with other third parties, mostly in aggregate, but occasionally your profile is shared together with your personally identifiable information. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the Video Professor Web Sites user's computer, which is tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions at (<http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;EN-US;q278835> for Internet Explorer and <http://help.netscape.com/kb/consumer/19971020-3.html>) for Netscape. 

By setting cookies on the Video Professor Web Sites, users would not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookies, they may still use the Video Professor Web Sites. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. For example, the user may not be able to retrieve account information or use some of our community features. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. See the "Profile" section. 

Some of our business partners may use cookies on the Video Professor Web Sites. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies once we have given permission for them to set cookies. 

### Log Files

Like most standard site servers, we use log files. This includes Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser types, Internet service providers (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform types, date/time stamps, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Video Professor Web Sites, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses can be tied to personally identifiable information to enable our web-based service.

### Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We or our third-party partner companies employ a software technology called clear gifs, aka Web Beacons/Web Bugs, that help us better manage content on the Video Professor Web Sites by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. Clear gifs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear gifs can be tied to users' personally identifiable information. Clear Gifs can "work with" existing cookies on a computer if they are both from the same web site or advertising company. That means, for example, that if a person visited "www.companyX.com", which uses an advertising company's clear gif, the site or advertising company would match the clear gif's identifier and the advertising company's cookie ID number to show the past online behavior for that computer. This collected information would then be given to the advertising company or site. To learn more about our use of clear gifs, please contact us via e-mail, phone, or postal mail at the addresses above. In addition, we, or our e-mail deployment partner, may use clear gifs in our HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails the recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt out of these e-mails, please see the Choice/Opt Out section. This privacy statement covers use of clear gifs by this site only and does not cover use of clear gifs by our partner companies or their third party advertisers. For information about third-party partner companies' use of clear gifs, please visit their sites directly and review their online privacy statements. 

## Communication from Video Professor

### Special Offers and Updates

We send all new online customers and members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and user name. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users, we present the option to not receive these types of communication. Please see the Choice/Opt-out section below. 

### Newsletter

If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name, zip code, and e-mail address. Out of respect for our users' privacy, we provide a way to opt out of these communications. Please see the Choice/Opt-out section below. 

### Service Announcements

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service-related announcement. For instance, if our online service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we may send users e-mail. Generally, users may not opt out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature. 

### Customer Service

We communicate with users on a regular basis to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account, we reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with the users' wishes. 

## Sharing

### Legal Disclaimer

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law or we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on the Video Professor Web Sites. 

### These are the instances in which we will share users' personal information:

We share the information we collect from you with third parties, including our business partners. For example, we may pass your e-mail, name, and/or other personal information to a third party that we feel may have products or services which may be of interest to you. 

### Third Party Intermediaries

We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

### Service Providers

We partner with other third parties to provide specific services. For example, at the conclusion of a sale, you may be offered magazine subscriptions. When the user signs up for these particular services, we share name or other contact information, such as address and/or phone number that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These third parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services. 

### Business Transitions

In the event Video Professor goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via e-mail and a prominent notice on our site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. 

### Choice/Opt-out

Our users are given the opportunity to opt out of having their information used for purposes not directly related to the Video Professor Web Sites. Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt out of receiving these communications by going to [Video Professor's Opt-Out website](http://www.videoprofessor.com/freestuff/unsubscribe.html) and entering their e-mail address, or the users may contact us at 303-232-1244, or via postal mail: 12055 West 2nd Place, Lakewood, CO 80228-1562, ATTN: Remove to opt out. After you submit your opt out request, we will remove your e-mail address from our database within ten days. 

### Links

This site may contain links to other sites and we will, on occasion, create partnerships with third party companies, where we host their content, or vice versa. Please be aware that we, Video Professor, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Video Professor Web Sites. 

### Surveys, Sweepstakes & Contests

From time-to-time our site offers users the opportunity to participate in surveys or contests. We may request information from users via surveys or contests but participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information such as name and shipping address and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used and shared with the contest or survey sponsors to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Users' personally identifiable information may be shared with third parties but only in accordance with our privacy policy. 

### Tell-A-Friend

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about the Video Professor Web Sites, we ask him or her for the friend's name and e-mail address. Video Professor will automatically send the friend an e-mail inviting them to visit the Web Site(s). Video Professor stores this information for the purpose of sending e-mails and tracking the success of our referral program. The friend may contact Video Professor at [remove@videoprofessor.com](mailto:remove@videoprofessor.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 

### Security

When users submit sensitive information via telephone or via the Video Professor Web Sites, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our online registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted using SSL. All information entered into our order forms will be encrypted when you submit the information page. To learn more about SSL, follow this link: <http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html>. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is also restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Periodically, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure, locked facility. 

### Supplementation of Information

We sometimes supplement the information we receive with information from third-party sources. 

### Enhancement of Marketing Profile

We may purchase third-party marketing data and add it to our existing user database to better target our advertising and provide pertinent offers we think our users would be interested in. We use this information to enhance or overlay the "profile" of individual users. This aggregate marketing data is therefore tied to the users' personally identifiable information. See also the "Profile" section. 

### Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

If a registered customer's contact information changes (such as zip code, phone number, e-mail, or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate his or her personally identifiable information. This can usually be done by e-mailing our Customer Support at [cservice@videoprofessor.com](mailto:cservice@videoprofessor.com), or by contacting us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below.
