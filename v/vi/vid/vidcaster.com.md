##### Privacy Policy

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how Vid Network, its subsidiary and affiliate corporations, successors, and assigns (collectively referred to as “Vid Network”) uses and protects the information you provide. This privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) applies to this World Wide Web site and any variations or successors to this website (vidcaster.com, the “Vidcaster Site”), any Vid Network computer software downloadable or otherwise available from the Vidcaster Site (“Vidcaster Software”) and any Vid Network services purchased or otherwise made available from the Vidcaster Site (“Vid Network Services”) (collectively, the “Vidcaster Properties”). This Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to all Users (“Users”) of the Vidcaster Properties.

##### A. WHAT INFORMATION VID NETWORK COLLECTS FROM YOU

Vid Network may collect two (2) types of information about you: Personal and Non-Personal.

.

##### B. HOW VID NETWORK COLLECTS YOUR INFORMATION

Prior to using one or more of the Vidcaster Properties, Vid Network may require certain Personal Information and Non-Personal Information to create an individual account (“Account”) or to enable features or functionality of the Vidcaster Properties. Failure to provide all required information required by Vid Network may prevent access to any or all Vidcaster Properties, and failure to maintain accurate information may result in suspension or termination of access to any or all Vidcaster Properties.

2\. Information Collected Through Technology. While you are able to visit the Vidcaster Site and remain anonymous, Vid Network or its third party service providers may still collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the Vidcaster Properties (e.g. your Internet browser, operating system, IP address, connection speed, and the domain name of your Internet service provider). Such information may be gathered by the following methods:

(a) Cookies. Cookies, including local shared objects, are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive which work by assigning to your computer a unique number that has no meaning outside of the Vidcaster Site. Cookies do not generally contain any Personal Information. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser to prevent this.

(b) IP Address. You may visit many areas of the Vidcaster Site anonymously without the need to become a registered User. Even in such cases, Vid Network may collect IP addresses automatically. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you begin Services with an Internet services provider. Each time you access the Vidcaster Site and each time you request one of Vid Network’s pages, the server logs your IP address.

(c) Web Beacons. Web beacons are small pieces of data that are embedded in web pages and e-mails. Vid Network may use these technical methods in HTML e-mails that Vid Network sends to Users to determine whether they have opened those e-mails and/or clicked on links in those e-mails. The information from use of these technical methods may be collected in a form that is Personal Information.

(d) Tracking Content Usage. If you use the Vid Network Services and you post audio visual materials including, without limitation, text, logos, artwork, graphics, pictures, advertisements, sound and other related intellectual property contained in such materials (collectively, “Content”) to your website or to a third party website, Vid Network tracks and captures Non-Personal Information associated with User accounts and the use of Content.

Parents or guardians may authorize Minors between the ages of 13 and 17 to use the Vidcaster Properties, provided they assume all responsibility and legal liability for the conduct of such Minor including, without limitation, monitoring the Minor’s access and use of the Vidcaster Properties. Vid Network does not intentionally collect nor maintain any personally identifiable information from Minors. If you discover your Minor child has submitted his/her information to Vid Network, you may request to have such information deleted from Vid Network’s database by sending an e-mail request to [privacy@vidcaster.com](mailto:privacy@vidcaster.com) together with the e-mail address that was submitted by the Minor.
