**_What this Privacy Policy Covers_**

This Privacy Policy ("Privacy Policy") is a public statement of how Vidiac, Inc. ("Vidiac", "we", "us", "our") handles your personal information with respect to websites owned and operated by Vidiac (collectively, the "Sites"). Also, this Privacy Policy covers Vidiac's treatment of any personal information that Vidiac's business partners share with Vidiac. By visiting the any of the Sites, submitting information, or using any of our products or services, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**_Collection of Information_**

**Information You Provide to Us**. Vidiac may receive and store any information you enter on any of the Sites or provide to us in any other way. For example, in order for you to use the Sites, you may be required to complete a registration form (as part of this registration form, we require your first and last name and your email address). In addition, users need to maintain their collection of videos, images and other materials ("User Submissions"), and Vidiac maintains a database of information about users in order to augment this - e.g. we maintain email addresses of users uploading User Submissions to the Sites so we can email a user when his or her User Submissions are optimized and ready to be watched. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features. The personal information you provide may be used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about promotions.

**Automatically Collected Information**. We may automatically receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us, such as, "traffic data" received by our server logs from your browser including your IP address, cookie information, and the page you requested. Vidiac uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Sites. We may also automatically collect usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our Sites and their components. This data is only used in the aggregate, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Such data enables us to figure out how often users use parts of the Sites, so we can make the Sites appealing to as many users as possible. We may share such aggregate information with our partners, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal Web experience.

**_Information Sharing and Disclosure_**

Vidiac does not share personal information with other companies, except under the following circumstances or with your consent:

**In Aggregate**. When Vidiac is working with advertisers, the press or the media we will disclose aggregate information about the use of our system. For example, "We have `x' Thousand users using our services in the Netherlands."

**Affiliated Business We Do Not Control**. We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them in order to provide our services to users. We will only share personal information that is necessary for the affiliate to provide such services. Our affiliates do not have the right to share or use personal information for any purpose other than for an authorized service or transaction.

**Personnel; Agents**. Our personnel and agents (including, for the avoidance of doubt, consultants and/or contractors) may have access to user information while carrying out their duties in the normal course of our company business. 

**Business Transfers**. In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Vidiac, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.

**Legal**. We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Vidiac, our employees, our users, or others. For example, if video of a crime or other unlawful activity is uploaded to Vidiac, Vidiac may initiate an investigation by contacting authorities. 

**User Profiles**. In connection with user submission of User Submissions to the Sites user profile information including users' name, phone number, and email address may be displayed to other users to facilitate user interaction within the Sites. E-mail addresses are used to add new User Submissions to user profiles. Users' full names will not be directly revealed to other users by Vidiac, however, to facilitate searching User Submissions, Vidiac allows users to search for other users by using first and last name and other information users provide in their profile. 

As part of the Sites, you will receive from Vidiac and other users e-mail and other communication relating to your User Submissions. You acknowledge and agree that by posting such User Submissions, Vidiac and other users may send you e-mail and other communication that relate to your User Submissions.

**_Your Ability to Edit your Personal Information_**

In order to edit the information we have on file with you, you will need to maintain an account on Vidiac. Information is keyed to your provided email address and you can have the system email you your most recent password to gain access. Because of the complexity of the server logs, users do not have access to any IP/HTTP server log information, nor can we practically link it to an individual user. 

**u**

We hate spam as much as you do, and Vidiac will not sell your email address to third party marketing companies. However, email is a key component with the Vidiac system and we use an email address to identify you, and associate ownership of your videos with an email account. In that regard Vidiac will email you system notifications about your account, changes to your account, password resets, video status, etc. Vidiac may also send out emails with news or promotions. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please notify us by e-mail at [unsubscribe@Vidiac.com](mailto:unsubscribe@Vidiac.com) and include sufficient information for us to identify your account. Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Sites, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.

**_Conditions of Use_**

If you decide to visit the Sites, your visit and any possible dispute over privacy is subject to this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use, including limitations on damages and application of California state law. 

**_Third Party Websites_** Vidiac services may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Sites. These other websites are not under Vidiac control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Sites are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and Vidiac is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.

**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_** Vidiac may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time, at its sole discretion. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes to the Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting an announcement on the Sites so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances if any, it is disclosed.

**_In Closing_** Simply stated, Vidiac values your privacy. We do have to know something about you in order to provide this system, and we do need to be able to tell others how popular/unpopular various features of the system are as we continue to grow. That said, we understand as a publisher and technology provider that users of the Vidiac system drive our success so your privacy is of the utmost importance to us.

**_Questions or Concerns_** If you have any questions or concerns regarding privacy at the Sites, please send a detailed message to [info@Vidiac.com](mailto:info@Vidiac.com). Your privacy is important to us and we will make every effort to resolve your concerns.

**_Effective Date of This Privacy Policy_**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of November 13, 2007.
