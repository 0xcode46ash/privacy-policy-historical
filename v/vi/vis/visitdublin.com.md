This Privacy and Cookies Policy (the " **Policy** ") refers to the website, [www.visitdublin.com](http://www.visitdublin.com/) (the " **Website"** ). The Website is operated by the National Tourism Development Authority (also known as **Fáilte Ireland** ) (" **we** " or " **the Authority"** ), whose principal place of business is at 88-95 Amiens Street, Dublin 1.  This Policy (together with our Terms of Use and any other documents referred to in such Terms of Use) sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.  Please read the following carefully. Entering into this Website indicates that the user (either " **user** " or " **you** ") has reviewed this Policy and has agreed to be bound by it as well as our Terms of Use.  If you do not agree to these terms you must leave the Website immediately.

**What information do we collect?**

We fully respect your right to privacy in relation to your interactions with the Website and endeavour to guarantee to be transparent in our dealings with you as to what information we will collect and how we will use your information. Also, we only collect and use individual user details where we have legitimate business reasons, and where we are legally entitled to do so.

**How do we collect information from you?**

**IP Addresses**

We collect IP addresses from visitors to our Website (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet). This allows us to identify the location of users, to block disruptive use and to establish the number of visits from different countries. We analyse this data for trend and statistics reasons, such as which parts of our Website users are visiting and how long they spend there.

**Cookies**

We collate information on all our Website traffic that is represented in aggregate format through cookies. We use third parties such as Google Analytics to collect user information, including through the use of cookies (flash and non-flash) and web beacons.  They help us to improve our Website and to deliver many of the functions that make your browser experience more user friendly.   You can find a list of cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them in the tables below.

This cookie is typically written to the browser upon the first visit to the Website from that web browser. If the cookie has been deleted by the browser operator, and the browser subsequently visits the Website, a new __utma cookie is written with a different unique ID. This cookie is used to determine unique visitors to the Website and it is updated with each page view. Additionally, this cookie is provided with a unique ID that Google Analytics uses to ensure both the validity and accessibility of the cookie as an extra security measure.

__utmb

| 

This cookie is used to establish and continue a user session with the Website. When a user views a page on the Website, the Google Analytics code attempts to update this cookie. If it does not find the cookie, a new one is written and a new session is established. Each time a user visits a different page on the Website, this cookie is updated to expire in 30 minutes, thus continuing a single session for as long as user activity continues within 30-minute intervals. This cookie expires when a user pauses on a page on your site for longer than 30 minutes. You can modify the default length of a user session with the [_setSessionCookieTimeout()](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gajs/methods/gaJSApiBasicConfiguration#_gat.GA_Tracker_._setSessionCookieTimeout) method.
