# Privacy Policy | Visible Measures

Visible Measures takes your privacy seriously, and provides this Privacy Policy to aid in understanding the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of information about our users. Visible Measures may modify this policy at any time by updating the policy itself or by providing notice via our partners.

**

1\. What information does Visible Measures collect?

**

Visible Measures collects information regarding the viewing of online video. Our partners want to know how many people watch video clips and what player features (recommend, e-mail, pause, etc.) viewers take advantage of. When you use a site employing our technology, we will not collect personal information about you unless you provide us with that information voluntarily. "Personal information" refers to data such as a name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, or credit card number. 

**

2\. What is Visible Measures' practice regarding cookies?

**

Like many common online video services, our technology uses Flash-based "cookie" technology (technically referred to as [local shared objects](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_cookie)) to customize and enhance your online experience. These are pieces of information transferred to your computer's hard drive when you visit a site that automatically identify your browser(s) to the server whenever you interact with video content on the site. Visible Measures may combine information obtained through the use of local shared objects with other aggregate or anonymous data, including a unique ID number assigned to you.

You may choose to opt-out of Visible Measures' local shared objects via the Visible Measures [Viewer Settings Manager](https://web.archive.org/viewer-settings/). If you do so, that opt-out will be effective for all Visible Measures-enabled sites. 

**

3\. How does Visible Measures use information?

**

Visible Measures aggregates user-specific information and discloses that information in a non-personally identifiable manner to our partners and other third parties for marketing, analysis and other purposes. We do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally.

**

4\. What happens if the privacy policy changes?

**

If the policy if modified, the changes will be reflected in this area of our site. Our partners will also be notified and they will be encouraged to alert users to the change in status. 

**

5\. What about links?

**

The sites of our partners may contain links to other Web sites. Visible Measures assumes no responsibility for the content or the privacy policies of such sites.

**

6\. What if I have questions?

If you have questions regarding this policy, please email us at [_privacy@visiblemeasures.com_](mailto:privacy@visiblemeasures.com).
