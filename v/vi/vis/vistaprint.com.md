Privacy Protection

VistaPrint recognizes the importance of maintaining your privacy.

When you sign up for an account, place an order, or volunteer information to receive our services, we collect some data about you, including your e-mail and IP addresses. The data helps us continue to serve you effectively: your IP address helps us diagnose problems with our server and administer our web site and your e-mail address allows us to contact you with order confirmations and for internal marketing purposes.

Any financial information you submit is used only in billing for the specific transaction in which the information was submitted. We do not retain credit card information between transactions; consequently, you will be asked to reenter your credit card information each time you place an order.

Secure Encryption

We use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which is supported by the vast majority of modern Internet browsers. SSL works best when you are using the latest 128-bit encryption versions of either Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator.

SSL technology represents the highest level of security available on the Internet. It automatically encrypts information traveling over the Internet, verifies the identity of the transacting servers through certificates and digital signatures, and verifies that the integrity of message content is maintained throughout transmission.

VistaPrint's minimum requirement for transactions is the standard 40-bit or 56-bit encryption supported by the following browser: Internet Explorer 5.0. If you are not using this browser, please refer to your browser’s documentation for information on its security features.

For more details on the browsers supported by VistaPrint.com please see our[ browser requirements](https://web.archive.org/vp/util/browser_requirements.asp) page.

Problems Signing In

To ensure protection of your confidential information, we have carefully designed a process to assist you when you have trouble signing in. In almost all cases, problems signing in result from the submission of an unrecognized username and/or password.

Credit Card Transactions

To protect both you and us, VistaPrint checks all submitted credit card numbers against a database of stolen account numbers. Before completing a transaction we also verify that the submitted account has a sufficient available balance to cover the transaction total.
