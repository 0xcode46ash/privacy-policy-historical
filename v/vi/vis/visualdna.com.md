**Updated  June 1, 2018**

VisualDNA, a Nielsen Company (“we” or “us”),  with a registered office and principal place of business at Nielsen House, John Smith Drive Oxford OX4 2WB United Kingdom provides various data analytics and targeted content and advertising services (“Services”) and devises image-based quizzes (“Quizzes”) for our clients and business partners, which include website owners and advertisers (“Clients”) under the VisualDNA, Youniverse and Imagini brands.  We also operate a number of websites, including: [http://www.visualdna.com](http://www.visualdna.com/) and my.visualdna.com (the “Sites”).

As the controller of the personal information that you provide us or we collect or process in connection with our Sites, Quizzes and Services, we are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy sets out our data processing practices, including how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you or that you provide to us or our Clients through the use of/or in connection with the provision of our Sites, Quizzes and Services or your use of the Internet and any other electronic communications networks. 

Where our Quizzes appear on third-party websites or we are providing our Services on behalf of our Clients, any personal information collected may be provided to the website owner and its use governed by the relevant website’s Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy, unless otherwise expressly indicated.  Please review all third-party websites’ Privacy Policies carefully, as we are not responsible for the practices of such parties.

If you have any queries or comments about our collection or use of your information, please get in touch with us by emailing us at nmcdata@nielsen.com.

### ****1\. Information Collected****

We collect personal information from visitors to our Sites or our Clients’ websites, individuals who open advertising emails sent by us or our Clients, participants in our Quizzes and users who interact with online adverts or who otherwise visit websites within our network. 

The information we collect may include: 

  * Information provided by you.
  * Data on your image preferences and information about products and/or pages viewed when you participate in our Quizzes.  Although we cannot identify you individually from your image preferences, your responses help us to build a picture of you, your characteristics, lifestyle and/or preferences in order to serve you personalised adverts and content.
  * Records of our correspondence with you or information from such correspondence if you contact us. 
  * Information collected automatically from your device, including:
    * Information from cookies, which are small pieces of information sent by a web server to a web browser, which enables the server to collect information from the browser. You can find out more about our use of cookies and how to manage cookies on your device in our [Cookie Policy](http://www.visualdna.com/cookie-policy/).
    * Your IP address, which is the unique address of your computer that  is automatically provided to other devices when your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from those devices  on the Internet.
    * Information about the type of browser you are using (for example, Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari).
    * Your hardware or operating system device identifier (for example,  IDFA for iOS, Android ID for Android and Google Ad IDs.



We may combine the above categories of  information with information about you that we get from other sources, including information held by our Clients and our business partners. Details about our use of your information can be found in the “Use of Information” section below. 

We do not intend to collect information about minors under the age of eighteen (18), and we request that minors not complete the Quizzes or provide information through our Sites. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a minor, we will delete that information from our records.

We also do not seek any sensitive personal information (e.g., information relating to an individual’s racial or ethnic origin, political opinions,religious or other similar beliefs, health or medical conditions, criminal background or trade union membership) through our Sites or Quizzes or in connection with our Services.  

### ****2\. Use of Information****

_On behalf of our Clients_

  * We process personal information for the purposes of providing our Services for the benefit of and on behalf of our Clients.  Our Services involve analysing the categories of information described above to create a picture of your lifestyle, interests and browsing and shopping intent as well as tastes and preferences.  Although most of the information we collect pertains to your browser or device (e.g., cookie IDs, IP addresses) and does not directly identify you, it enables us to create groups of users with similar browsing or behaviour patterns and interests, depending on our Clients’ specifications.  We call this process ‘Modelling’ and we call these groups “Audience Groups.” The Audience Groups can then be used to provide you and others within your Audience Group with content and adverts that are more relevant to your lifestyle and interests. We call this activity ‘Ad Targeting’. We also use device-unifying technology to establish the connection between a user’s devices. This enables us to provide targeted advertising services and  profile users across our network. You can find out more about our use of cookies [here](http://www.visualdna.com/cookie-policy/).
  * Our Quizzes may include questions originating from our Clients and business partners (including Media IQ, whose privacy policy can be found [here](http://wearemiq.com/privacy-policy/)) and asked on behalf of specific advertisers. These organizations may receive and use your data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  
  * We may also use the the information for Analytics, Strategic Research and  Development, Measurement (to measure the effectiveness of content and adverts) and Customisation (to provide you with a more personalised service on both our Sites and our Clients’ websites).
  * Where our Clients are using your information for the above purposes, we encourage them to make you aware of this in their privacy policies and to explain how you can opt out of such practices.



_For our own purposes_

  * Our Sites are generally intended for use by our Clients and other businesses looking to use our Services.  We will, therefore, use your personal information to provide and improve our Services, respond to your enquiries and requests, administer orders and accounts and provide you with information about our Services.  
  * We may also use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to gather statistics about the number of people who visit our Sites and  customise the Sites’ content, layout and services. You can find out more about our use of cookies [here](http://www.visualdna.com/cookie-policy/).
  * Where applicable, we comply with the Internet Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) Good Practice Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.



Data protection laws in certain jurisdictions require that we only collect and process personal information where we have a lawful basis and that we set out in this Privacy Policy the legal grounds upon which we rely to process your information. 

With respect to the personal information of European Union (EU) residents, we rely on your consent to process your personal information. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information relating to you, we will do so because either: (a) you have given us your explicit consent to process the information; (b) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or (c) you have made the information manifestly public. 

### ****3\. Disclosures of Information****

  * We will only share your name, contact details and other information which can directly identify you, with our Clients if you have provided your express consent.  We may share other information, such as your responses to Quizzes as part of our Services, to enable our Clients to design or improve their services and products, and for other marketing-related purposes as described in this Privacy Policy.
  * We may also transfer certain information, such as your IP address and information about your internet browsing history (such as sites visited or interactions with advertisements) and other information collected via cookies, Web beacons and other technologies to our Clients, advertising partners and other third parties within our network. This information, which may be combined with information held by our Clients or business partners, may be used to provide advertising, promotions and other products and services that may be of particular interest to you. It may also be used to provide you with a tailored choice of content and media products.  We do not provide our advertising and promotions partners with access to your name or personal contact information unless you choose to share it with them. Additionally, we do not provide your name or personal contact information to an advertising partner when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement. You can find out more about our use of cookies [here](http://www.visualdna.com/cookie-policy/).
  * We may engage third parties to provide services on our behalf, which may involve them processing your information, e.g. to complete partial addresses or to augment the information we hold about you.  Such parties may only act on our instructions and are not able to use your information for their own purposes without your consent.
  * We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Privacy Policy to third parties in connection with certain corporate transactions, such as  a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or re-organisation. However, except as described above or unless we are required to do so: (a) by law; (b) to enforce our terms and conditions of use; or (c) to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers or others, we will not disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission.
  * All of these disclosures may result in the transfer of your information to countries or regions with data protection laws that differ from those in your country of residence, and by browsing the Sites, participating in Quizzes and communicating electronically with us, you are consenting to such transfers. In cases where your information is transferred outside your country of residence, we will ensure that there are adequate safeguards in place to protect your personal information. If you are a resident of the EU, such safeguard might be a data transfer agreement with the information recipient based on standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission for transfers of personal information to third countries. For further details relating to the transfers described above and the adequate safeguards used with respect to such transfers, contact us at nmcdata@nielsen.com.
