### Who we are

"We" are Imagini Holdings Limited, 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB, Company Registration Number: 05730835 & Imagini Europe Limited, 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB, Company Registration Number: 05565112. Our VAT Number is 915772114.

We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998, Number Z9712306.

### Introduction

We operate a number of Sites and Products/Services under the VisualDNA, [Youniverse](http://www.youniverse.com/ "Visit www.youiverse.com \(opens in a new window\)") and Imagini brands.

We are always committed to protecting your privacy.

This privacy policy is a general policy that sets out the data we may collect from you or that you provide to us, from any of our Sites and/or Products/Services (collectively referred to as "Sites" or "Services"), and how and for what purposes we use the information collected about you. 

A Privacy Policy appears on each of our Sites along with the Terms and Conditions relating to that Site/Service. By using our Sites and Services, you are agreeing to be bound by those Terms and Conditions and the Privacy Policy. Where our Services appear on third party websites (unless otherwise expressly indicated) you will be subject to that website's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

If you have any queries or comments about our use of your information, please get in touch with us by emailing us at [contact@imagini.net](mailto:contact@imagini.net "Email contact@imagini.net") or writing to Customer Support, Imagini Holdings Limited, 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB.

### Information collected

We collect the following types of information about users:

#### Information provided by the user

We may collect demographic information from you, such as, but not limited to, age, gender and country. 

We may collect personal information such as, but not limited to, name, address and email address.

We collect data on your image preferences to our visual questionnaires and information about products and/or pages viewed via our visual questionnaire.

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence and/or collect information from such correspondence.

Where our Services appear on third party websites, personal information provided will be owned by that website. You should therefore read that website's Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy.

#### Information collected automatically

We receive and store information, which is transmitted automatically from your computer when you browse the Internet and use our Sites/Services.

This information includes information from cookies, your IP address and browser type. Your IP address is the unique address of your computer which is automatically provided to other computers when your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from those computers on the Internet.

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of the Sites/Services. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you use our Site/Services.

### Use of information

We generally use the information we collect about you to provide a more personalised service, improve the service we offer, provide information services to relevant third parties and for our own marketing and promotion.

We will use your email address to contact you from time to time and may also use it for security reasons to confirm that you are who you say you are. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings by emailing [contact@imagini.net](mailto:contact@imagini.net "Email contact@imagini.net").

We may also use the information collected automatically, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to gather statistics about the number of people who visit the Sites and to customise the Sites content, layout and services.

### Sharing information

We share information (non-personal and non-identifiable) with our partners for example, responses to visual images and products/pages viewed. This information will be used by the partner to design services and products for other marketing purposes.

We only share users' personal, identifiable information with our partners if the user opts in to have their information shared.

We may transfer information about your use of our Site/Service, such as your IP address and information stored via cookies, to our advertising partners and other third parties. This information may be used to provide advertising, promotions and other products and services that may be of particular interest to you. It may also be used to provide you with a tailored choice of content and media products. 

Our advertising and promotions partners have no access to your name or personal contact information stored by us unless you choose to share it with them. We do not provide your name or personal contact information to an advertising partner when you interact with or view a targeted advertisement.

This Policy applies only to Sites operated by Imagini and not to other websites to which we provide links or other websites which use our Services. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and practises of any other website, even if you access them using links from our Sites or if you can access our Sites/Services from them. You are therefore advised to read the privacy policy of such other websites.

We may also use third parties to provide services on our behalf which may include processing (but not themselves using) your information e.g. to complete partial addresses or to augment the information we hold about you. In either case, we will not pass your data to anyone who is not also registered under the Data Protection Act 1998 or is not subject to these or similar provisions in our contract with them and we will not allow the third party to use your information commercially without your consent.

We may transfer, sell or assign any of the information described in this Policy to third parties as a result of a sale, merger, consolidation, change of control, transfer of assets or re-organisation of Imagini Holdings Limited or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates.

Your personal information will not be transferred outside of the European Economic Area without your express consent.

Unless we are required to do so by law or to enforce our terms and conditions of use, or to protect the rights, property or safety of our customers or others we will not disclose, sell or distribute your information to any third party without your permission.

### Accessing, changing or removing your information

You always have the option to remove or amend your data [at any time](http://my.visualdna.com/ "Visit my.visualdna.com \(opens in a new window\)").

Any user may at any time request access to all personal information we hold on you, by writing to Customer Support, Imagini Holdings Limited at 7 Moor Street, London W1D 5NB. We will provide this information within 40 days of a written request for a small administrative charge.

### Safeguards, security and storage

Although we do our best to protect your personal data we cannot guarantee the security of the data transmitted to the Site; any transmission is at your own risk. We will use all reasonable endeavours to protect the security of your personal information from unauthorised access or use.

All of the information we collect or record is restricted to our offices or designated sites. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. We will explicitly ask you when we need information to identify you. We may require you to co-operate with our security checks before we disclose information to you. 

We will retain your information for a reasonable period or for as long as is required by law.

In addition to these safeguards your personal information is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998.

### Changes to Privacy Policy

We may change this Policy at our discretion by changing it on the Sites, we indicate at the top of the page the date the Policy was last revised. The then current version of this Policy will apply whenever you use our Sites/Services. If you do not agree with the new Policy then please do not access or continue to access our Sites/Services. It is your responsibility to regularly check the Sites to see if there have been any changes to this Policy.
