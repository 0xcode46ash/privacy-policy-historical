Under Section 4 of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003 you have a right to get a copy of the personal data, which we have relating to you.

We will also require applications to include any personal data, which relates to our company, such as your Username or password. We will do our best to ensure that your request is dealt with within 28 days of receipt of application.

## Company Data Right of Access

Information supplied to CRO pursuant to the Companies Acts and the Registration of Business Names Act do not come within the Data Protection Acts 1998-2003, being "personal data consisting of information that the person keeping the data is required by law to make available to the public". Such data therefore falls outside the Terms of this Privacy Statement. Examples of information which does not fall under the Right of Access would be, Directors Appointment, or change in particulars of Details, and or the Registration of a Business or Company Name.
