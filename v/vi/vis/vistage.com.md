# Vistage International Privacy Policy | Executive and CEO Organization

This policy covers how Vistage treats personal information that Vistage collects and receives in connection with our public, private and/or restricted-use Web sites including but not limited to: [www.vistage.com](http://www.vistage.com/), [view.vistage.com](http://view.vistage.com/), [village.vistage.com](http://village.vistage.com/), [my.vistage.com](http://my.vistage.com/), [vistageconnect.com](http://vistageconnect.com/) and [myvistageconnect.com](http://myvistageconnect.com/) (collectively, the “ **Sites** “). Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, e-mail address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

**Information Collection and Use**

Vistage collects personal information when you register with any of our Sites.

When you register with one of our Sites we ask for information such as your name, e-mail address, birth date, gender, zip code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. Once you register with a Site and sign in to the Site, you are not anonymous to us.

Vistage automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, Vistage cookie information, and the page you request.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Vistage does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  1. When we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
  2. When we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Vistage’s Terms of Use, Confidentiality Pledge and Standards or as otherwise required by law.



**Cookies & Pixel Tags**

We collect visitor information by using cookies and pixel tags.

Cookies are files or pieces of information that may be stored in your computer’s hard drive when you visit a Web site. This file or piece of information allows a user to move quickly and easily around our Sites and is used to identify returning users. We also use a cookie to track a user’s sessions. We use this information to find out what site features are most popular so we can develop our Sites and content in light of our analysis of people’s usage.

The use of cookies is an industry standard and done on most Web sites. We do not, however, use cookies to retrieve involuntary information about your computer.

Accordingly, if you would prefer, you can set up your browser to refuse cookies or to alert you to their presence and thereby allow you to remove them from your computer. If you reject cookies, you may have difficulty navigating parts of our website, and may need to enter identifying information each time you access a password protected page.

A pixel tag, also known as a clear GIF or web beacon, is an invisible tag or tiny graphic image placed on certain pages of our website or in emails but not on your computer. When you access these pages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of that visit. They usually work in conjunction with cookies, registering when a particular computer visits a particular page. If you turn off cookies the pixel tag will simply detect an anonymous website visit. Pixel tags help us analyze our visitors’ online behavior and measure the effectiveness of our websites and our advertising. We work with service providers that help us track, collect, and analyze this information.

Pixel tags on our sites may be used to collect information about your visit, including the pages you view, the features you use, the links you click, and other actions you take in connection with the sites. This information may include your computer’s Internet protocol (IP) address, your browser type, your operating system, date and time information, and other technical information about your computer. We may also track certain information about the identity of the website you visited immediately before coming to our site. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

Pixel tags and cookies in our emails may be used to track your interactions with those messages, such as when you receive, open, or click a link in an email message from us.

We also work with third-party companies that use tracking technologies to serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet. These companies may collect information about your visits to our websites and your interaction with our advertising and other communications.

We may combine the information we collect through cookies and pixel tags with other information we have collected from you. This information may be used to improve our websites, to personalize your online experience, to tailor our communications with you, to determine the effectiveness of our advertising, and for other internal business purposes.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We limit access to personal information about you to staff who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide services to you or in order to do their jobs.

We take all reasonable precautions to keep your personal information secure and we have put in place physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

Our Sites contain links to other third party Web sites; however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites and do not make any representation as to the existence, sufficiency, accuracy or completeness of their Web sites or privacy policies.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

Due to changes in legislation and best practice or enhancements to functionality and content on our Sites, Vistage may update this privacy policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary e-mail address or by placing a prominent notice on the applicable Site(s), and accordingly you should check here from time to time.
