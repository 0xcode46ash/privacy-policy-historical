# Travel to Norway – Norway official travel guide » BookNorway AS – Privacy & Security Policy

We understand that the privacy of your personal details, and the security of your transactions with us, is of paramount importance to you. BookNorway has therefore adopted data protection policies with respect to your privacy and security. BookNorway’s Privacy Policy sets out the rules we will abide by when dealing with personal information we collect from individuals in the course of our business. We will never allow a third party to use your personal data for marketing and communication purposes.

We have based our privacy policy upon applicable Norwegian consumer and data protection legislation.

By disclosing your personal information to us when using our online reservation service or interacting with us over the telephone, you consent to the collection, storage and processing of your personal information by BookNorway in the manner set out in this Privacy Policy.

We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete your order and fulfil your travel arrangements. Such other parties may include, but are not limited to, appropriate travel suppliers and credit card merchant services. BookNorway has placed contractual limitations on our suppliers from using or disclosing your information without your permission. However, these travel suppliers may contact you as necessary to inform you about delays and other trip related urgencies.

 **Collection, storage and processing of your personal information include the following data and collection methods:**

 **1\. "PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION" (PII)**

 **Personally Identifiable Information (PII) is information that identifies you as an individual.**

 **Travel reservation related details entered by you during the reservation process**

When you make reservations with BookNorway, or when you make an enquiry about our services, BookNorway will collect personal information from you, including but not limited to:

  * your name, your mailing address, your phone number, your email address.
  * information necessary to facilitate travel or other services, including travel companion(s’) names, special requests.
  * payment information such as your credit card number, card type, cardholder name, expiration date.



We use this information to complete your order (which also includes use of your data for confirmations, invoices, accounting, audits, ticketing, credit or other payment card verification), to fulfil customer service requests, to give you access to limited-entry areas of our web pages, and to contact you via email in relation to trip related information and information about upgrading your use of our services.

 **Customer reviews**

BookNorway offer an online facility allowing customers to post Reviews.  We may collect and display reviews, comments and other material from customers after they have completed the consumption of products purchased via BookNorway.  You disclaim any proprietary rights you may have in such Customer Reviews, and your review(s) may be freely used, copied, distributed and made available in any medium and in any form by BookNorway or its affiliates without your permission.

BookNorway does not edit Customer Reviews submitted, and to the fullest extent permitted by law will not be in any way responsible or liable for such Reviews or their subsequent posting, use or distribution. In addition, BookNorway does not verify, endorse or approve the views or comments expressed in any Reviews which are the personal views of the individuals submitting them. Any decisions made on the basis of reviews or comments appearing on the service are taken at your own risk.

 **2\. "NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION" (or "Non-PII")**

 **Non-Personally Identifiable Information is aggregated information and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity.**

 **Statistics gathering and aggregation**

BookNorway uses commonly employed Internet technologies to collect additional information about users. For example, BookNorway and our affiliates use "cookies" to determine how users reach the BookNorway Web pages and to track general usage patterns once a user is on our Web pages. "Cookies" are small pieces of information that are transferred by a website and stored by your web browser on your computer’s hard drive. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies; however, you can always choose not to accept a cookie by changing your computer preferences to refuse cookies or to prompt you to accept each cookie, but doing so may limit the range of features available on BookNorway pages.

No identifying information is collected by our web analytics software. The software records the IP address of the visitor only. Information is collected, aggregated and analyzed in order to improve the function, content, overall appearance, and capability of the BookNorway reservation service.

BookNorway also collects certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during your visit to BookNorway Web pages. This information is collected from your computer’s web browser to enhance your experience on our Web pages and may include your IP address, operating system, web browser software (e.g. Internet Explorer), screen resolution, and referrer website.

In instances where Non-PII is combined with PII (such as combining your name with your geographical location) the combined information will be treated by us as PII.

 **Access to your reservations**

We use the information you have provided to give you access to your reservations (and other information available) on limited-entry areas of our site. To access your reservation, you will be asked to enter your username and password before viewing your information.

 **Data protection**

When you provide personal information to us through our reservation service we will take all reasonable steps to protect this information through the use of secure software, which encrypts the data you provide.

BookNorway is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide in computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit sensitive information (such as a credit card number) over the internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

 **Protection of children**

BookNorway does not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

 **Enforcement of this Privacy Policy**

We will treat all information we collect from you as strictly confidential. BookNorway does not rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. We will not reveal, disclose, sell, distribute, rent, license, share or pass onto any third party (other than those who are contracted or supply services to BookNorway) any personal information that you may have provided to us unless we have your express consent to do so, other than in the circumstances set out in the next paragraph. 

  * BookNorway may disclose the information that we collect about you when we have reason to believe that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or entities who may be causing injury to you, to us, or to others. 
  * We may also disclose your information when we believe the law requires it.



We require that all our customers agree to abide by our Privacy policy as part of our terms of trade. This policy also applies to users of our web site who are not customers of BookNorway. BookNorway is a Reservation Service operating from Norway and governed by Norwegian law. You agree that any disputes will be dealt with by the city court of Oslo in accordance with the laws of Norway.

Please note that we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for the privacy or security practices of any other web sites which you may be able to access through our site, or for our customers’ level of compliance with our code.

 **Changes to this statement**

BookNorway may, in its sole discretion, revise this privacy policy at any time and all such revisions shall be effective when posted. Privacy Policy changes will apply to the information collected from the date we post the revised Privacy Policy, as well as to existing information held by us. You can determine when this Policy was last revised by referring to the "Last updated" legend at the bottom of this page.
