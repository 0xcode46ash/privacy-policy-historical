# Privacy Statement

**Visions Federal Credit Union Privacy Statement**

In recognition of our members' expectation of privacy, Visions Federal Credit Union has adopted the following privacy statement. 

Visions will collect only the personal information that is necessary to conduct our business. That means just what is necessary to provide competitive financial products and services - no more.Â  We may gather general information about site visitors' browsing activities. This enables us to track how a visitor navigates through the site and the areas in which they show interest. This is similar to a traffic report: it tracks trends and behaviors of members in general, but does not identify individuals in particular. 

Visions will protect your personal information. We will maintain security controls to ensure that member information stored on our premises and in our files and computers is protected. Where appropriate, we will use security-coding techniques to protect against unauthorized access to personal records, ensure accuracy and integrity of communications and transactions, and protect member confidentiality. 

**Restrictions on the Disclosure of Account Information**

  
Visions Federal Credit Union will not disclose confidential member information outside the credit union unless: 

1\. The member consents to the disclosure;  
2\. The information is provided to help complete a transaction that the member has authorized;  
3\. Legal or regulatory requirements oblige the credit union to supply the information;  
4\. It is supplied to a vendor working on behalf of the credit union; or  
5\. It is a credit-reporting agency. 

**Employee Access and Use of Member Information**

Within Visions, the credit union requires that confidential information be safeguarded at all times and be used only for legitimate business purposes. 

The credit union takes measures to limit employee access to confidential information on a "need-to-know" basis and makes every effort to ensure that financial information is maintained in an accurate and up-to-date manner. We educate our employees about the importance of confidentiality and customer privacy through standard operating procedures, special training programs, and Visions' Code of Ethics. 

**Member Choice**

The credit union will occasionally inform members of new products and services via email, mail or telephone. If a member wishes to opt out of these offers, Visions will attempt to honor that request. Simply notify the credit union of your wish, and you will be excluded from future offers. 

**Maintaining Member Privacy in Our Business Relationships**

The credit union will not sell or share member personal information with a third party for the third party's own independent use. However, Visions occasionally contracts with outside vendors and other business partners to perform specific services for the credit union. We require these vendors to honor and safeguard the information we provide them and to follow strict confidentiality requirements. 

If you have any reason to believe that your personal information retained at Visions Federal Credit Union is incorrect, please call us at 607-786-1222 or email us at [lwasyln@visionsfcu.org](mailto:lwasyln@visionsfcu.org). We will investigate the problem and, if appropriate, update the credit union's records.
