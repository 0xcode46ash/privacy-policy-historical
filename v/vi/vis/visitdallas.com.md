The Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau, a Texas nonprofit corporation ( “DCVB”), has created this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website located at VisitDallas.com and DCVB.com (the “Site”).

This Policy tells you, among other things, what information we gather from you through our Site, how we may use or disclose that information, and our efforts to protect it.  

 **Collection of Personal Information**  
User information is collected primarily to provide a more efficient DCVB online experience, as well as new, updates and information to help the DCVB meet your needs.

We may request that you voluntarily supply us with personal information such as your home zip/postal code and other such information. By voluntarily providing personal information, you are consenting to the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with the terms of this Policy.

You may choose not to use any service that requires the use of your personal information in a manner not described in this Policy. Your use of the Site, or any other DCVB online services, will be considered to be your consent to the use of your personal information in the way described in this Policy.

 **Use of Information**  
The information we collect via the registration process on the Site is used to better serve your online needs. It is the policy of DCVB not to sell, share, transfer, or rent to third parties any information you provide to DCVB, through the use of the Site, without your written consent except as required by operation of the law or in compliance with legal authorities; provided, however DCVB may share your personal information with certain third parties ("Target Third Parties") without your written consent in order to further the purpose for which you voluntarily provide the DCVB with the information or as expressly provided below. For example, DCVB engages third party information management service providers to help maintain efficient operations. Because such information management service providers may access our systems, such information management service providers may have access to your information. The DCVB does not transfer or relinquish ownership of information maintained about you within DCVB systems and databases to such information management service providers but requires these information management service providers to sign confidentiality agreements to keep all confidential information and other proprietary information found in our systems confidential.

If you choose to create a DCVB profile or receive information, or to otherwise give us personal information, we may store some or all of that information and use it for marketing research and marketing purposes. The information is not collected for sale to third party marketers and we do not sell or distribute the information collected from the site for commercial marketing purposes.  DCVB is the owner of the information collected on this Site.    
We use return e-mail addresses to answer the e-mail we receive. We may also use these e-mail addresses to communicate information to you regarding Site, regarding programs which may be of interest to you affiliated with DCVB and to respond to queries.  To make sure receive news, updates and information provided by DCVB via e-mail, you may register at the Site.  We may use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our Site and we may share what we learn with our marketing and advertising agencies. We may choose to disclose all of the information we collect, to companies that perform services on our behalf, such as data processors, technical systems consultants and programmers and the advertising firms that we use to promote our Site.  To enhance your experience on the Site, we might use information you provide to us through your DCVB profile to pre-populate forms with your name, address, phone, and email address. If you choose to save information, such as a meeting planner RFP form, on our Site, we may contact you to follow up on your interest in our convention and meeting services. In such cases, we may employ an outside firm to call you on our behalf.    We may use the personal identifying information you provide to monitor usage and traffic-levels, analyze trends, administer the Site, track user movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  We may also use your information to contact you regarding improvements we can make to our Site and our services.  DCVB may also share aggregate information about our users with advertisers, sponsors and other third parties, though such summary information will not identify any specifics directly related to your identity.  We may also provide analysis based on the information we collect, to our strategic alliance partners and other risk sharing partners.  We will use your e-mail address to assist you if you forget your log-in information or if you subscribe to a topic you will be notified by e-mail when a reply is posted to that topic.   We may also use your e-mail address to contact you directly regarding services, products or information that we believe might interest you.   Only DCVB (or agents working on behalf of DCVB and under confidentiality agreements) will send you these direct mailings. If you do not want to receive such mailings, you can easily opt-out of receiving further marketing from DCVB as provided in Choice/Opt Out below.

You authorize us to disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, violation of obligations to us under our Terms of Service or any other agreement or policy, or other illegal activity.

**Security**  
This website takes every reasonable precaution to protect our users’ information.  When you submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.  For your security, our credit card processing vendor encrypts sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our order forms using secure socket layer technology (SSL). In order for SSL to work, though, you must have a browser that supports SSL technology.  While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers, such as Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox, becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.  To learn more about SSL, follow this link:  [http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html.  
](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html)  
It should be noted that information you elect to post our the Site, e-mails and other information you send to us, except that which you send us on a secure page, is not encrypted and such transmissions cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information.  DCVB will never ask you to submit your financial data, such as your credit card account numbers, via e-mail.  IF YOU RECEIVE AN E-MAIL REQUESTING THAT YOU FORWARD INFORMATION OF THIS NATURE BY E-MAIL, PLEASE CONTACT US DIRECTLY AT privacy@dallascvb.com.  DO NOT REPLY DIRECTLY TO THE E-MAIL.  You should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit through the Site may be damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or accessed by another person without your permission. 

Finally, the servers on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment, with access restricted.

Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit. 

**Linked Sites**  
The Site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that DCVB may not be responsible for content or the privacy practices of such other sites.  We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Site and recommend that they read the privacy statements of each and every website they visit.  This Policy applies solely to information collected by this Site.

This Site is not directed at children under the age of 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  If DCVB obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information is immediately and permanently deleted from our records.
