The Dallas Convention and Visitors Bureau ("DCVB") respects the privacy and confidentiality of individuals who visit the DCVB web site located at [www.visitdallas.com](http://www.visitdallas.com/). The DCVB maintains this Privacy Policy to help you understand the commitment of DCVB to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to the DCVB on the DCVB Website.

Additionally, the DCVB engages third party information management service providers to help maintain efficient operations.

The DCVB reserves the right to take any action the DCVB deems prudent or necessary to safeguard the DCVB Website and your information in the DCVB systems and databases from malicious or unwarranted attack by viruses, hackers, or other miscreants.

Collection and Use of Your Information by Third Parties  
Please note that third parties offer goods and services on and through the DCVB Website. We assume each such third party has its own internal privacy policy and data collection and use practices. The DCVB does not have any responsibility for their practices.
