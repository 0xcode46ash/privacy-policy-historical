### Privacy 

The North Carolina Division of Tourism, Film and Sports Development is committed to protecting your privacy on this Web site.

Our privacy policy follows the Coalition for Advertising Supported Information and Entertainment (CASIE) Goals for Privacy for Marketing on Interactive Media.

We collect personal information from our visitors only on a voluntary basis. Personal information may include name, address, phone number, email address, and other relevant data. We do not require this personal information to obtain access to most of our site. We do, however, require it in order to properly fulfill requests for brochures and other information.

The personal information we collect is used by us only to process a request for information by you or for marketing our products or services. We do not sell or rent personal information to other organizations.

Our web server also collects the domain names, but not the e-mail addresses, of visitors to our website. This information is aggregated to measure number of visits, average time spent on the site, pages viewed, and other relevant statistics. We collect this information to measure the use of our site and to improve the content of our site.

The VisitNC website contains "links" to other sites, and we attempt to only link to sites that share our high standards and respect for privacy. However, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other sites and you are responsible for your visits to those sites.

### Cookies

To enhance your experience on our site, many of our web pages use cookies. Cookies are small text files that we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personal information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at our site. Once you choose to provide a web page with personal information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. A cookie is like an identification card. It is unique to your computer and can only be read by the server that gave it to you.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience on our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site). We also may use cookies to provide you tailored offers of products and services. Cookies are essential to the proper functioning of VisitNC.com.

If you want to control which cookies you accept, you can configure your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered by a website's server. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser option so that you will not receive cookies and you can also delete existing cookies from your browser.
