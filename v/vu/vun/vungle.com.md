# Privacy Policy - Vungle

## Vungle Inc.’s Privacy Policy

**EFFECTIVE DATE: October 31, 2013**

Vungle, Inc. (“Vungle,” “we” or “us”) understands the importance of privacy. Vungle operates a mobile ad network (the “Ad Network” or the “Services”) through which Vungle displays targeted, contextual ads. Our clients are “Advertisers” that wish to distribute ad content through the Vungle Ad Network, and “Publishers” that want to display ads to “end users” of their mobile apps. In this Privacy Policy (“Policy”), we describe how we collect, use, and disclose information that we obtain from end users in connection with the Vungle Ad Network.

**What Information Do We Collect and Why?**  
We do not collect name, email address or contact information from end users. However, in order to operate the Vungle Mobile Ad Network and to display ads to end users we may automatically collect certain information from end users within a single mobile application, including:

    * IP Address, Android ID, MAC Address, IFA, UDID, and other unique identifiers;
    * Activities and page views within a single mobile application or site; and



Language information, device make and model, device connection, height and width of device, device volume, time zone and city, state-level location information, and operating system type, name, and version.

We use various tracking technologies to collect this information, such as pixel tags, pixel impression trackers from services such as Doubleclick, and other mobile tracking technologies. We may also receive a list of unique identifiers from Publishers, which we may use to determine to what end users to display (or not display) certain ads.

We do not track end users across multiple mobile applications or sites, nor do we display behavioral advertising to users based upon their activities across multiple websites or mobile apps.

**How We Use Your Information**  
We use the information that we gather in order to operate the Vungle Ad Network, including:

  * To display ads to end users, to customize the ads we display to end users and to optimize the display of video ads;
  * For performance tracking and frequency capping, such as tracking views of ads, as well as clickthroughs and installs of apps that have been advertised;
  * For billing purposes;
  * To provide aggregate reports to Publishers and Advertisers; and
  * To improve our Services and for other research and analytical purposes.



**How We Share Your Information**  
We may share the information that we collect about end users as follows:

  * **Publishers and Advertisers.** We may share aggregate information with Publishers and Advertisers about the advertising displayed to end users and the success of ad campaigns.
  * **Service Providers.** We may disclose the information we collect from you to third party vendors, service providers, contractors or agents who perform functions on our behalf.
  * **Business Transfers.** If we are acquired by or merged with another Vungle, if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding, we may transfer the information we have collected from you to the other company.
  * **In Response to Legal Process.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you in order to comply with the law, a judicial proceeding, court order, or other legal process, such as in response to a court order or a subpoena.
  * **To Protect Us and Others.** We also may disclose the information we collect from you where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, violations of our Terms of Use or this Policy, or as evidence in litigation in which Vungle is involved.
  * **Aggregate and De-Identified Information.** We may share aggregate or de-identified information about users with third parties for marketing, advertising, research or similar purposes.



**Third-Party Links**  
Ads within the Vungle Ad Network may contain links to third-party websites and mobile apps. Any access to and use of such linked websites or mobile apps is not governed by this Policy, but instead is governed by the privacy policies of those third parties. We are not responsible for the information practices of such third parties.

**What about COPPA?**  
We are not responsible for the information practices of our Publisher clients. Publishers are responsible for ensuring that their mobile apps comply fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), including where relevant by obtaining parental consent prior to the collection of personal information.

Unique identifiers (e.g., IP address and device identifiers) are the only “personal information” under COPPA that Vungle collects from end users. Vungle only uses the unique identifiers (and other associated information) it collects from end users to support its internal operations. We do not display behavioral advertising to end users based upon their activities across multiple sites or mobile apps, nor do we amass profiles about users activities across multiple apps.

**Security**  
We have implemented technical and administrative security measures to safeguard the information we collect from end users.

**Contact Us**  
If you have questions about the privacy aspects of our Services or would like to make a complaint, please contact at marketing@vungle.com.

**Changes to this Policy**  
This Policy is current as of the Effective Date set forth above. We may change this Policy from time to time, so please be sure to check back periodically. We will post any changes to this Policy on our Site, at http://www.vungle.com/vungle-privacy-policy/.
