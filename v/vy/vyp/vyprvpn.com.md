### How VyprVPN Uses Collected Information From VPN Sessions:

This data is maintained for use with billing, troubleshooting, service offering evaluation, TOS issues, AUP issues, and for handling crimes performed over the service. We maintain this level of information on a per-session basis for at least 90 days. We may keep upload & download bytes at an aggregate level for longer periods of time.

  * ...does not perform deep packet inspection of your traffic, except where requested by the customer for firewall purposes.

### How VyprVPN Responds To Civil Investigations:

VyprVPN will not release a member's indentifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more - or usage information to investigators, attorneys, or agencies unless we are directed to do so by a court of competent jurisdiction in the matter. If there is a hearing in court, the member will be notified so they will have an opportunity to contest the surrender of personal information. 

### How VyprVPN Responds To Criminal Investigations:

VyprVPN cooperates fully with law enforcement agencies, yet there must still be a subpoena before VyprVPN provides a member’s indentifying information - minimal information reasonably calculated to identify and no more. In a criminal investigation VyprVPN is required by the Law to not divulge the fact of the investigation to the member.
