### What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?

When signing to our newsletter, you may be asked to enter your name and email address.

Since this blog is hosted on worpress.com, it uses Jetpack for comments on posts and pages. When writing a comment, you need to provide your name and your email address. The email address is used by Jetpack to notify you when someone replies to your comment. We don’t use your email address you supplied for comments for any other purpose. Other than email, your IP address is collected by Jetpack. We never use this IP address for analytics or for any other purpose.

For more details about how Jetpack manages comments, check out their [privacy policy](https://jetpack.com/support/privacy/).

### When do we collect information?

We collect information from you when you subscribe to a newsletter, fill out a form or enter information on our site.

Also, we use the [Redirection plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/) which logs the IP address in case of a 301 redirect or a 404 HTTP response. This is used so that we can find out if a certain resource on our site is no longer found or to redirect the user to the new resource location in case we changed the slug of a page or post.

### How do we use your information?

We may use the information we collect from you when you make a purchase, sign up for our newsletter, respond to a survey or marketing communication, surf the website, or use certain other site features in the following ways:

To send periodic emails regarding new blog posts, your order or other products and services.

### Email List

We have an email list which allows us to communicate with the regular readers of this blog. We use an email marketing tool called [MailChimp](https://mailchimp.com/) for this purpose.

MailChimp collects the following data:

  * The email address of the subscriber.
  * The name of the subscriber
  * The location of the subscriber.
  * The method that was used to subscribe the newsletter.
  * The preffered language.
  * The favorite email client and format.
  * the last profile update timestamp 
  * The tags which are used to segment subscribers to different lists. These email preferences are saved by using tags. Also, if the person has purchased my video courses or books, he/she will have tags which identify him/her as a person who has purchased this course.
  * A list of emails sent to the subscriber.
  * A list of emails which were opened by the subscriber.
  * A list of emails which were clicked by the subscriber.



MailChimp collects its data by using these data sources:

  * The email address and email preferences (tags) are provided by the subscriber. Also, when a subscriber opens our email or clicks a link found from our email, MailChimp updates the open and click statistics of the email in question.
  * A list of emails sent to the student is updated by MailChimp when we send a new email to the subscribers of our newsletter.
  * When a person subscribes our newsletter and he/she has purchased any of my video courses or books, an administrator will add to the correct tags to the subscriber.



We use the collected data for four different purposes:

First, we send useful content to our subscribers. This means that every time when we publish a new blog post, we send an email to our subscribers.

Second, we send relevant marketing emails to our subscribers. These emails target our own products which are created by the same persons who write the articles you read on this blog.

Third, we send an email if one of the subscribers has been nominating for winning a free copy of our books.

Fourth, we use the open and click rates for improving our communication. We want to provide useful information to our readers. If the user does not engage with our content, we might unsubscribe him/her because we don’t want to send emails to people who are not genuinely interested in our content.

We collect this data because the subscriber has given us his/her consent to do so. When a person subscribes our email newsletter, we are using double opt-in so that he/she has to confirm his/her subscription by clicking the confirm link found from the confirmation email.

This data is stored as long as the subscriber is subscribed to the newsletter. When a subscriber wants a refund for his/her video course purchase, we permanently delete their data from MailChimp, but his/her purchase/refund will still be available in Teachable, the platform hosting and managing payments for the video course.

### California Online Privacy Protection Act

CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at:

http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

Users can visit our site anonymously.

### COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)

When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation’s consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety online.

We do not specifically market to children under 13.
