Email, text or fax marketing

We would also like to provide you with the information above by email. However, we appreciate that email and text “spam” has become a problem in recent years. Therefore we would only use one of these methods to market to you if you have indicated your consent. If you are a customer or you have previously asked us for information on our products, we may send you information on our range of products and/or services by email, unless you have asked us not to do so.

If the reason you have given us personal information is to receive email information from us, we will continue to provide this information by email unless you ask us not to do so.

Otherwise, when you provide us with personal information, we will ask you whether or not you are happy for us to send you this kind of information by email. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to receive marketing emails from us, please write to us at Vanquis Card, Customer Service, PO Box 399, Chatham, ME4 4WQ.

We will process, by computer or otherwise, personal information about you whilst we are assessing your application and/or managing your Account. We may search your credit record at credit reference agencies in relation to your application or for managing your Account, and they will supply us with credit and/or identification information.

Details of our search will be added to their records whether or not your application is successful. Credit and identification information about you and those with whom you are financially linked, which is provided to us and credit reference agencies, may be used by us and other companies to make credit decisions about you and other members of your household. Any of this information may also be used for identification purposes, debt tracing and prevention of money laundering, as well as the management of your Account.

We will, on a regular monthly basis, provide details of the performance of your Account to credit reference agencies. This information may be used by other companies to make decisions about credit and credit-related services for you and other members of your household. It is important that you give us accurate information. We will check your details with fraud prevention agencies and if you give us false or inaccurate information and we suspect fraud, we will record this.

We and other organisations may search and use these records to:

i) help make decisions about credit and credit-related services for you and members of your household;

ii) help make decisions on motor, household, credit, life and other insurance proposals and insurance claims for you and members of your household;

iii) trace debtors, recover debt, prevent fraud, and manage your Account(s) or insurance policies; and/or

iv) check your identity to prevent money laundering unless you provide us with other satisfactory proof of identity.

We, the credit reference agencies, the fraud prevention agencies and/or the Provident Financial group may use the fraud prevention agency and/or credit performance records for statistical analysis about credit, insurance and fraud. We may also use your information to carry out market research.

For the purposes of managing your Account, credit assessment and analysis, your information may be shared within the Provident Financial group and outside the group to:

i) our agents, processors and sub contractors;

ii) any of our approved suppliers;

iii) the police, if required by law; and/or
