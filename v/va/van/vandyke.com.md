VanDyke Software® is committed to protecting your privacy. The following discloses our information collection and use practices. We collect industry-standard information to help us provide you with better software and services as described below. VanDyke Software does not sell, trade, or give out customer information gathered from its web site.

When you contact us, place an order, download an evaluation, or join a discussion list, we ask for your contact/billing information. This information is used for internal operations, possibly to send surveys, and to provide you with updated information on our products on an "opt-in" basis. Opt-in means you must request a subscription. 

VanDyke Software publishes newsletters and product announcements via e-mail that customers may subscribe to on an opt-in basis. 

When you opt-out of promotional communications from us, you may still receive service messages (such as an order confirmation), legally mandated notices, and critical messages that relate to the ability to use software or services that you have purchased from us.

Certain exceptions to this privacy policy's rules for the collection and sharing of personal data may be made in "click wrapped" agreements available on an optional, or opt-in, basis elsewhere on this site, for example in the forums or as part of a survey.

Our web site may contain links to other web sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites, and we encourage you to review the policies of each site you visit.

VanDyke Software uses collected information as follows:

**Order Forms:** When you order, we require users to give contact information (like your name and e-mail address) and financial information (like your account or credit card numbers). Customer contact information from the order form is used to communicate with customers about order status and to verify identity during support and customer service requests. Financial information is used solely for the purpose of billing the user for products.

In European Union (EU) countries, all online transactions are handled by Digital River, Inc. on behalf of VanDyke Software. We have partnered with Digital River to ensure we are compliant with EU regulations regarding privacy of customer information. Digital River operates under a clear and comprehensive [privacy policy](http://www.digitalriver.com/corporate/privacy.shtml).

**User Surveys:** Your participation in surveys is optional. We, or an authorized agent, may ask you for information regarding your experience with our software or web sites, or to provide demographic information such as age, gender, or areas of interest. We use this information to help us improve our software, plan marketing initiatives, and develop new products that may interest you.

**Downloading Secure Products:** Download of VShell® Server, SecureCRT® and SecureFX® require a street address, phone number, and e-mail address. This is done to verify location as required by U.S. export control regulations. Information submitted is checked in real time by CyberSource, a third party service that monitors order acceptance against a continually changing list of denied countries or persons, and electronically verifies the customer's location. Names or company names and addresses of customers purchasing licenses for VShell Server, SecureCRT and SecureFX outside the U.S. and Canada must be reported to the Bureau of Industry and Security. No other personal information is reported.

**Cookies:** VanDyke uses "cookies" to help create a more effective and convenient web site experience. By showing us how and when visitors use the site, cookies help us determine which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on data such as total number of visitors and pages viewed. Vandyke.com does not store any sensitive information in the cookie.

**Disclosure required by law:** Please be aware that in certain circumstances, it is possible that personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. 

**Changes to this privacy policy:** We may occasionally update this privacy policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy policy. For material changes to this privacy policy, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of our web site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy policy to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect.

If you have questions about the privacy policy, please [contact](https://web.archive.org/contact.html) us.
