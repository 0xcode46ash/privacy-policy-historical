# Privacy Policy & Refund Terms - Virtual Assistant Networking Organization

Read our Privacy Policy  


### Shipping/Handling:

VAnetworking.com doing business as Mediamage Business Solutions (MBS) wants its members and customers to be happy with their purchases. If you are unhappy with your purchase, please contact us at 604-542-9664 for a RA number (Return Authorization) number to start the return process if eligible.

You may be subject to import duties and taxes upon shipment of your order to you (all items are shipped from Canada), which are levied once the package reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, when ordering from MBS, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods.

### Refunds:

MBS will grant refunds with RA number (**less restocking, shipping, handling and and border custom charges), for our own physical products (*excluding) returned to MBS in resell-able condition in original packaging within 15 days of the invoice date.  [The Virtual Business Startup System (VBSS)](http://virtualassistantinabox.com/) has an extended return date of 45 days from date of invoice.

Our [Virtual Assistant Website Packages](http://www.vanetworking.com/virtual-assistant-websites/) are non refundable. Virtual Assistant Website Design Package purchases must be used within 45 days from the date of purchase.

> *Sale items, instant downloaded products like ebooks, audios, and [VAinsider Club](http://vainsiders.com/) Memberships, etc. are final sales and are non-refundable. Recurring monthly memberships may be cancelled by contacting our [help desk.](http://vasupportdesk.com/) to request cancellation. Refunds from products from third party affiliate programs are dealt with directly by the third party themselves and MBS is not responsible for contact with third party nor refunds.

**All returns are subject to a 7% restocking fee which covers restocking and administrative costs. Shipping, handling and and border custom charges that occur to ship to buyer and incurred upon shipping back to MBS during the return process are extra and will be deducted from buyers refund. Shipping the product back with original shipping methods usually avoids all custom/brokerage fees so do not ship with another courier service to avoid these extra custom border fees upon entering Canada. The VBSS may be subject to an additional fee of $333 if a VAinsider membership was included with purchase of VBSS (* instant downloadable product). Return requests must be in writing and be accompanied by a RA.number. There are no price guarantees on any products.and some discounts are limited-time offers only. MBS may offer a 7 day price guarantee against sale items if purchaser contacts MBS during sale period. All exchanges or returns must follow the above RA process.

To prevent fraudulent acts, refunds are only issued back through the same payment process as the payment was made through and no substitutions are allowed.  ie) If you paid by your Visa card then the refund can only be issued back to the same Visa card number you paid with and not a different credit card/cash/cheque/etc.

Most orders will be mailed within 5 days of receipt and be sent by Canada Post Expedited Parcel or Express Post with delivery approximately 8 to 14 days later anywhere in North America. International orders can take up to 2-6 weeks for delivery, please email us for speedier shipping options upon ordering if you wish to pay extra for quicker delivery.

If order by mail, please send money orders to:
