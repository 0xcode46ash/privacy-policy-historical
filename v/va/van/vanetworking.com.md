# Privacy Policy | Virtual Assistant Networking Association (VANA)

Virtual Business Solutions (VBS) wants its members and customers to be happy with their purchases. If, for any reason, you are unhappy with your purchase, please contact VBS at 604-542-9664 for a RA (Return Authorization) number to start the return process if eligible.

VBS will grant full refunds (less shipping and handling), for certain products returned to VBS in resalable condition within 30 days of the invoice date. All returns are subject to a 10 percent restocking fee. Return requests must be in writing and obtain an RA. Sale items and VAinsider Club Memberships are final sales and non-refundable.

You may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches your country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country; you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, when ordering from VBS, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods.
