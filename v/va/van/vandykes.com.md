**Updated 1-14-05 – Important Policy Changes that apply to all Van Dyke’s Customers**

**_What personally identifiable information is being collected?_**

When you visit the Van Dyke’s Web site, in order for us to provide you with the products or services that you have requested, you may be asked to provide us with personally identifiable information. For example, when you order a product, we will ask you to become a registered user of our site, during which you will be asked for your shipping and billing addresses, your email address, and your credit card number or other payment-related information. If you request one of our newsletters or send an inquiry to one of our customer service representatives, we will also store a record of your request along with your email address. In addition, our Web servers track various technical details about your visit, such as you computer’s IP address and which pages you visited, however that information does not typically contain any personally identifiable information about you.

**_How is the information being used?_**

The information we collect is used to provide the products and services that you have requested or that we think you might have an interest in. It is also used to improve the content of our Web site, to notify you of problems with your requests, or to update you about changes to our Web site.

**_With whom do we share your information?_**

In order to operate this Web site and in order to provide you with the products and services you have requested, we need to share information with third parties. We may transmit your personal information to service providers who assist us in processing orders, shipping products to you, processing your payment information, sending you catalogs, conducting surveys, on and offline sweepstakes , sending you emails and newsletters. We have agreements with these service providers that they will protect your privacy in accordance with our standard Privacy Statement. Some of those organizations may have their own Privacy Statements which may give you additional protections, so you are encouraged to read those statements when presented to you.

**_How do I access, update, or delete my personally identifiable information?_**

If you are a registered user of the Web site, you can manage many aspects of your registration information. For security reasons, however, some parts of your personal information may not be changed online and may require you to call or write to us in order to verify your identity before such changes can be made. The online registration area will also permit you to exercise control over the use of your email address, allowing you to opt-out of future email messages from this Web site. Unfortunately, due to various legal and recordkeeping requirements, we may be required to maintain records about your purchases or other activities on this website. However, you will always be permitted to opt-out of any marketing uses of information stored about you.

**_What information will be disclosed if required by law?_**

If required by law, we may provide any and all information we have about you to law enforcement or other government agencies, pursuant to a subpoena, warrant, or other order by a court of competent jurisdiction. In all cases, we will require written documentation of the request, proof of the identity of the law enforcement official making the request, and we will take steps to authenticate the validity of the request. Any law enforcement or government agency request submitted with less than a court-issued order will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis according to the need and urgency, as well as the particular law enforcement agency making the request.

**_What personal information is collected in_** ** _Van Dyke’s Forums and Chat?_**

The message boards and chat features are provided without any warranty and you use them at your own risk.

**_What are cookies and how do we use them?_**

These types of cookies cannot identify an individual user specifically, such as by name or address, unless the cookie data is attached to personally identifiable information such as online registration. Van Dyke’s uses cookies to observe our site visitor's navigation throughout the site. This helps us identify ways to improve the shopping experience.

Van Dyke’s also uses a session cookie, which is a piece of identification between your browser and our server, which helps to do things like keep track of the items in a user's shopping cart, and other information. The shopping cart cookie is saved for a designated period of time in case the users’ session expires or they return to complete a purchase in that time frame _._

You may modify your email preferences at any time by **[www.vandykes.com/login.php](http://www.vandykes.com/login.php). **

If you provide us with your postal address, you may receive periodic catalogs from us, or other notices containing information about new products and services or upcoming events. On occasion, we may make our email and postal mailing address lists available to subsidiaries and affiliated companies that are part of the Van Dyke’s family of companies.

_Security_

**_What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under our control?_**

Van Dyke’s values your business and is committed to doing everything possible to make our online ordering process secure.

**_Secure Ordering Process_**

Any credit card information you enter on our site is strongly encrypted by industry-standard protocol, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). The Van Dyke’s Web site uses SSL to communicate with secure browsers like Netscape and Internet Explorer. These browsers encrypt your credit card and personal information in a way that makes it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept and misuse while being transmitted between your computer and our server. Don't worry if your browser is secure or not - if it is insecure, you will not be able to purchase on our online store.

Once you have completed your order online, our security procedures do not end. We take appropriate precautions to protect the security and privacy of the information stored on our computer networks. Many of the systems which store your personal information are not connected to the Internet, reducing the likelihood of security breaches. Our systems are also housed in secure facilities, and access to your data by our employees is limited to a “need to know” basis, controlled by password protected systems, and monitored for abuse. 

If you are still unsure of giving your credit card over the Internet, please feel free to phone, fax, or mail your order to us. For telephone ordering or assistance, please call Van Dyke’s at 1-800-787-3355. Our fax number for Customer Service is 1-605-796-4085 (for US/Canada 1-605-796-4425). Or, send your order to:

Van Dyke’s  
P.O. Box 278  
Woonsocket, SD 57385-0278 

If you have any further question regarding your online security, please contact us at 1-800-787-3355 or [e-mail Customer Service](mailto:restorers@cabelas.com).

**Children**

In accordance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13 without the verifiable permission of a parent or guardian. If you are under age 13, you are welcome to browse our Web site. However you are not permitted to use any of the features of our site that require the collection of any personally identifiable information. If we determine that we have erroneously collected a child’s information, we will immediately undertake to delete that data from our records.
