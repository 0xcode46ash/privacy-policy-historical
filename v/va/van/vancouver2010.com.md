****  
  
Respecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information is important to the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter GamesÂ  ("VANOC"). This Privacy Policy explains how VANOC collects, uses, and discloses the personal information that you may provide while using VANOC's website (the "Website"). We note that this Privacy Policy is based upon the Canadian Standards Association's Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information.  
  
**Information About All Website Users**

If you browse VANOC's Website, you do so anonymously. We do not collect personally identifying information unless you voluntarily provide it to us. However, like many other websites, the Website may automatically collect certain non-personally identifying information regarding your use of the Website, such as the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access the Website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to the Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of the Website you visit, the Website pages read and images viewed, and the content you download from the Website. This information is not linked to you as an individual user. Rather, it is recorded as general statistical information, which may be used and disclosed to others by us in order to monitor use of the Website, to improve the Website and generally enable us to provide you with the best possible web experience. We may also archive this information for future use.  
  
**Information About You**

During your use of the Website, you may be asked to voluntarily provide certain personal information (such as your name, email address, postal address or telephone number) for purposes such as facilitating communications with you, applying for access to certain special features or areas of the Website, or using certain services available through the Website. It is always your choice whether or not to provide such personal information. If you choose not to provide requested personal information, you may not be able to use certain features or services provided through the Website. If you choose to provide personal information, it will be stored and processed in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  
  
We will not sell, trade, lend or otherwise voluntarily disclose to any third parties any personally identifying information that you have provided to us for any purpose not provided for under this Privacy Policy. 

We may use your personal information to contact and correspond with you, respond to your inquiries, process instructions or to facilitate and enhance your use of the Website. We may also develop a confidential customer profile for you. 

We may send to you, from time to time, e-mail or other communications containing information about us, our activities and other matters that we believe will be of interest to you. At any time you may ask us to stop sending you such unsolicited e-mail and other information by contacting us at info@vancouver2010.com. 

In certain circumstances we may disclose your personal information to a government institution that has asserted its lawful authority to obtain the information or where we have reasonable grounds to believe the information could be useful in the investigation of unlawful activity, or to comply with a subpoena or warrant or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information, or to comply with court rules regarding the production of records and information, or to our own legal counsel.  
  
**Securing Your Information**

To help protect the confidentiality of your personal information, we employ security safeguards appropriate to the sensitivity of the information. Nevertheless, due to the nature of the Internet and Internet technologies, security and privacy risks cannot be entirely eliminated.

 **Accessing Your Information**

You may request access to your personal information and information about our collection, use and disclosure of that information by contacting us at info@vancouver2010.com. We attempt to keep our records as accurate and complete as possible. You can help us maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your personal information.  
  
**Other Matters**

The Website contains links to other websites. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or liability for or control over those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.

The Terms of Website Use Agreement governing your use of the Website contains important provisions, including provisions disclaiming, limiting or excluding our liability for your use of the Website. Those provisions apply to any disputes that may arise in relation to this Privacy Policy and our collection, use and disclosure of your personal information, and are of the same force and effect as if they had been reproduced directly in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy may be changed from time to time in our sole discretion and without any prior notice. New versions of this Privacy Policy will be posted here. Your continued use of the Website subsequent to any changes to this Privacy Policy will signify that you consent to VANOC's collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with the revised Privacy Policy.

If you have any comments or questions about this Privacy Policy or your personal information, please contact us at info@vancouver2010.com.
