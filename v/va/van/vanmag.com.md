By using a browser feature called a “cookie” and other methods, TC Transcontinental and our third party Service Providers may gather non-personal information when you visit our websites such as data about the frequency of your visits to our websites, the duration of your visits, the number of pages you view and the type of Internet browser and operating system you use. A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that identifies the visitor’s browser, but not necessarily the visitor, to our computers each time our websites are visited. Website visitor information is collected on an anonymous basis, which means that no Personal Information is associated with such data, unless a visitor specifically provides us with such information (e.g. by enrolling to our services or by sending us a message from our websites).

In addition to the identified purposes described in this Privacy Policy, we may use information obtained from our websites and share it with other organizations with whom we have a commercial relationship to measure the use of our websites and to improve the functionality and content of our websites. TC Transcontinental and our third party Service Providers may also use cookies and invisible web beacons to deliver interest-based advertisements that are relevant and targeted to the visitors of our websites.

You can manage your cookies by installing a third party program or by configuring your web browser. Most web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies; however, you can delete or disable cookies by modifying your settings.

TC Transcontinental is not responsible for any information disclosed in our chat rooms and other public forums. Any such voluntary disclosures become public and are made at your own risk. Although it is prohibited to use our forums as a source for collecting e‑mail addresses for sending unfounded or unsolicited messages or spamming, others may still capture your e‑mail address and send you messages if you provide your e-mail address; we cannot control such actions by others. We advise you to remain prudent and attentive at all times when using the Internet.
