# VANS UK | PRIVACY POLICY

Vans is committed to respecting the privacy rights of all visitors to our web site.  
The following policy describes how Vans collects, protects and uses information it receives from visitors to the web site. 

### What information does Vans collect and how does Vans use it?

  * When you register on the site, we need you to provide your name, e-mail address, age group and sex. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for users to submit information to Vans, and receive back the information desired. 
  * Visitors will also be given a choice when registering whether they would like to receive the Vans newsletter, or whether they would prefer to opt-out and not receive such mailings from Vans. Visitors may action this at any time by following the instructions on the newsletter itself.
  * When you enter a contest or other promotional feature, Vans may again ask for the visitor’s name and e-mail address, so that they are able to better administer the contest and notify winners. 



### How does Vans protect visitor information?

Vans implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information. User personal information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. 

### Does Vans use "cookies"?

Yes. Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor’s hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor’s individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. 

Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. Even without accepting a cookie, you can still access most of the features on Vans’ site. However, cookies are used by Vans to track shopping basket items through the order and browsing process, so you won’t be able to place an on-line order if you disable cookies. Visitors who disable cookies can still place orders over the telephone by calling Vans’ customer service number. 

### Does Vans disclose the information it collects from its visitors to outside parties?

Vans does not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer outside the company personally identifiable information that visitors voluntarily provide in any registration or contest submission. This information is used to better understand visitors’ use of Vans’ site and to support related transactions made on the site.

### Third party links

In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, Vans may choose various third party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with Vans, Vans has no control over these linked sites who each have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of Vans.

Vans has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you therefore access them at your own risk. Nonetheless, Vans seeks to protect the integrity of its web site.

### Your consent 

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Vans. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
