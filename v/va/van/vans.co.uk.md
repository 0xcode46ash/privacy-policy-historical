We provide this Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on [www.vans.eu](http://www.vans.eu/).

**Collection of Personal Information**  
We have structured our website at [www.vans.eu](http://www.vans.eu/) so that you can visit our website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information other than the IP address you are using. Once you choose to provide us with personally identifiable information (i.e. any information by which you can be identified) when making an inquiry with us, you can be assured that such information will only be used to answer your inquiry.

The types of personal information collected at [www.vans.eu](http://www.vans.eu/) are the IP address that your computer is using when connecting to the internet and any other personal information (e.g. name, contact details or email address) you may voluntarily supply when making an inquiry with us.

We use IP addresses only to know how many users visit our website, the number of times a certain country link available on our website is chosen and for other similar statistical purposes. Personal information supplied by you will be solely used to answer your inquiry. We will delete any personal data as soon as we do not need them anymore.

We do not share or disclose your personal information with any third party unless we have your permission or are required by law to do so.

**Accuracy of Personal Information**  
We will strive to keep your personal information accurate. Upon your request, you will be able to find out about what personal information we have obtained from you and you will have the opportunity to update or correct your information that you submitted to us. You may also ask us to delete your personal information at any time.

**Security**  
We are committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorised access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of text asking permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. If you agree, then your browser adds the text in a small file. The purpose of a cookie is to help us analyse web traffic or let us know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow a web application to respond to you as an individual. By gathering and remembering information about your preferences, the web application can tailor its operation to your needs, likes and dislikes.

We use traffic log cookies to identify what pages are being used and which ones aren't. This helps us aggregate and analyse data about web page traffic and make improvements to our websites to better meet customer needs. In this case, we use this information only for statistical analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system. Denial of a traffic log cookie should not prevent you from using one of these sites.

Cookies help us give you a better web site to use, by letting us monitor what's working and what isn't through site traffic analysis. We want to be sure you understand that accepting a cookie in no way gives us access to your computer or any personal information about you, other than the data you chose to share with us. This practice is strictly enforced. We know that a lot of people have concerns about cookies, but in talking with many of our customers, we believe that the benefit we both gain from their proper use is worthwhile. We value the relationships we have with our visitors, so we respect these concerns. You may set your web browser (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests or decline cookies completely. You can delete the files that contain cookies; those files are stored as part of your internet browser.
