            information about the person and the company that is
            responsible for sending the commercial electronic message.
      ♦     Unsubscribe – We ensure that a functional unsubscribe facility

Consented to such communications
Commercial messages will only be sent to you when you have given
consent. This may be express consent – a direct indication that it is okay
to send the message, or messages of that nature or inferred consent
based on our business or other relationship with you and your conduct.
Comply with the law regarding viral messages
Vantage FX ensures that Commercial Communications that include a
Forwarding Facility contain a clear recommendation that the Recipient
should only forward the Commercial Communication to persons with
whom they have a relationship, where that relationship means that
person could be said to have Consented to receiving Commercial
Communications.
Comply with the age sensitive content of commercial
communication
Where the content of a Commercial Communication seeks to promote or
inspire interaction with a product, service or event that is age sensitive,
the Vantage FX takes reasonable steps to ensure that such content is
sent to Recipients who are legally entitled to use or participate in the
product service or event.
