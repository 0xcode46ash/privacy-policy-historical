We at Vault.com ("Vault") are committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. We also want to provide you with a more rewarding Internet experience by making the advertising and content you see on Vault's services (collectively, the "Services") relevant to you, based on who you are and where your interests lie. Your loyalty as either a visitor or a Member (i.e., an individual who signs up for access to one or more Services) is important, and we hope that our concerns regarding your privacy, as described in this policy (the "Privacy Policy" or "Policy"), demonstrate our commitment to making your Vault experience an enjoyable and useful one.  
  
Note that, by using the Services, you signify your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Services. Your continued use of the Services subsequent to changes to this Policy will mean that you accept the changes; therefore, please bookmark this page and review it frequently. If you have any questions regarding this Privacy Policy, the Services, or Vault, please e-mail us at privacy@staff.vault.com.  
  
**The information we gather**. Although most parts of the Services do not require you to be a Member (and you can therefore use them without submitting any "personally identifiable information," that is, information that relates to an identified individual), some areas - such as our detailed online profiles and industry guides - do. In order to become a Member, individuals are required to provide us with (a) an e-mail address and a unique user name and password, as well as certain personally identifying and other information such as the Member's zip code, country, industry and occupation and (b) before making a purchase, the Member's name, address, phone number, payment information (including credit card information), and other shipping information. Once you complete your registration, you will be given the opportunity to submit additional personally identifying information to create an "online profile" (the "Profile"). In your Profile, we ask for optional contact information, including demographic information (like age, or income level). Your contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. You may op-out of receiving future mailings; see the **choice/opt-out** section below. Demographic and profile data are also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor your experience at our site, showing you content that we think you might be interested in, and displaying the content according to your preferences. We also use demographic information to target advertisements to users from specific demographics. Vault also collects non-personally identifiable information (that is, information that does not identify a specific individual), such as aggregate use statistics for the Services, for both visitors and Members. We collect such non-personally identifiable information in part through the use of "cookies" - that is, small text files placed on your computer's hard drive. We collect some basic information about your computer and Internet connections, including: (1) your IP address (your computer's unique signature); (2) your operating system (e.g., Windows or Mac); (3) your browser software (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer); (4) your Internet Service Provider (e.g., AOL or AT&T) and (5) your geographic location (e.g., New York, NY.) Collecting this information helps us streamline your experience on the Services - for example, helping us diagnose problems with our server, administering our Web site, by "automatically" filling out forms for you, or keeping track of the contents of your online shopping cart.  
  
Please note that our advertisers and their designees, as well as other third parties, may collect information about you through cookies or other technologies when you visit their Web site(s). Vault uses a third party, DoubleClick, to serve the advertisements that you see on the pages of our Web site. Although Vault users cannot opt-out of the advertising process, DoubleClick offers you the ability to control the data collection and targeting process by using a "blank" or "opt-out cookie" to prevent any data from being associated with your browser or you individually. By denying DoubleClick's cookies, ads delivered to you by DoubleClick can only be targeted based on the non-personally identifiable information that is available from the Internet environment, such as browser type and Internet service provider. Your DoubleClick opt-out will be effective for the entire life of your browser or until you delete the cookie file on your hard drive. To learn more about the information gathering practices and how to opt-out, please [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/company_info/about_doubleclick/privacy/privacy2.htm).  
  
Additionally, the Services contain links to other third party Web sites, including co-branded or other affiliated sites which may or may not be owned or operated by or in conjunction with Vault. You acknowledge that we do not monitor or control the information collection or privacy practices of any third parties, and are not responsible for their practices or the content of their web sites, including their use of any information (such as IP number, browser type, or operating system) collected when visitors or Members "click through" links to their sites or view advertisements served by them. Even though certain information collected by such third parties might not identify you personally, we strongly encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices, and to contact such third parties if you have any questions about their respective privacy policies.  
  
**How we use (and do not use) the information we gather**. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with the different ways we use the information we gather. Keep in mind that, while Vault encourages all third parties involved - including but not limited to its advertisers - to adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our visitors and Members and to otherwise handle personal information in a responsible manner, we cannot and do not assume any responsibility for any actions or omissions of third parties, including the manner in which they use information received either from Vault or independently. Nevertheless, in the event you encounter any third party associated with, or who claims association with Vault, who you feel is improperly collecting or using information about you, please contact [privacy@staff.vault.com](mailto:privacy@staff.vault.com).  
  
|  (a) How we use (and do not use) non-personally identifiable information: We use non-personally identifiable information in aggregate form to build higher quality, more useful Services by performing statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our visitors and Members, and by measuring demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Services. We may provide statistical information based on this data to advertisers and other current and potential business partners.  
  
---  
(b) How we use (and do not use) personally identifiable information: Please note that Vault reserves the right to disclose information submitted by or concerning any visitor or Member as we reasonably feel is necessary to protect our systems or business. Specifically, but without limitation, we reserve the right to disclose such information when a visitor or Member is in violation of our Terms of Use or other published guidelines, or partakes (or is reasonably suspected of partaking) in any harmful, infringing or illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant, or other court order, and to disclose such information in response to court and governmental orders, civil subpoenas, discovery requests, and as otherwise required by law, as well as in response to allegations of infringement. We cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who may be using our servers or services for illegal activities. We also reserve the right to report any suspected illegal activity to law enforcement for investigation or prosecution, or to suspend or terminate your membership in connection with any suspected illegal or infringing activity.  
  
Subject to the foregoing, Vault uses your personally identifying information in several ways: 

  * to customize various aspects of the Services to your preferences; 
  * to determine which advertisements or sponsor messages will appear on your screen; 
  * to send you Vault solicitations, product announcements, and the like that we feel may be of interest to you (you may "opt out" of receiving these materials, as provided below); and 
  * as may be necessary to support the operation of the Services, such as for billing, account maintenance, and record-keeping purposes. 

Vault may disclose your personally-identifiable information to third parties as follows: 
  * with your authorization, such as when you click on a "submit order" or similar button when placing an order (your personally identifiable information will be shared with the merchant advertising the good or service you wish to purchase, so that such merchant may complete the transaction and ship the items(s) you have purchased); and 
  * if you do not "opt out" of receiving promotional materials (as discussed below), to third parties who provide goods or services that we believe may be of interest to you; 
  * to our contractors and consultants, and professional advisors (such as attorneys or accountants), but only to the extent necessary for them to perform services on our behalf, and only under reasonable disclosure restrictions. 

If you provide us with your credit card information, we will not release that information to third parties unless necessary to complete a transaction between you and such a third party. (Credit card transactions are handled by a third-party financial institution, which receives the credit card number and other personal identifying information only to verify the credit card numbers and process transactions.)  
  
**Choice/Opt-Out**. Vault provides you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving most communications from Vault, and/or its affiliates, advertisers, and other business partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. You have the option to remove your information from our database and to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. We also give you the option to change or modify the information previously provided. To exercise any of the foregoing options:  


  1. You can send e-mail to [webmaster@staff.vault.com](mailto:webmaster@staff.vault.com)
  2. You can visit the following URL: [www.vault.com/resume/currentuser.cfm](https://web.archive.org/resume/currentuser.cfm)
  3. You can send mail to the following postal address: 150 W. 22nd St., 5th Floor, New York, NY 10011 
  4. You can call the following telephone number: 212-366-4212 

Note that, because Vault will occasionally need to send you certain e-mail messages that are critical to your use of the Services, such as announcements, system status updates or order confirmations, you will not be able to "opt out" of receiving such messages.  
  
**Surveys and Sweepstakes**. Occasionally, Vault may conduct surveys in order to better deliver advertisements and content and to better understand your needs relating to the Services. We will not share your survey information with any third party, except in aggregate form. In addition, if and when we sponsor sweepstakes or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions in conjunction with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Policy, will govern that particular promotion or sweepstakes - please remember to read it carefully.  
  
**Public Forums**. Vault makes message boards available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.   
  
**Changing or deleting personal information**. You may view and, if you wish, change certain personally identifiable information by logging in to the Services with your user name and password on the Vault's Members Home Page. For security reasons, you will not be able to see your credit card number (if you have supplied one) or your password. You may also view and, if you wish, change information you submitted as part of your Profile (if any) on the Members Home Page.  
  
**Contacting the Web site**. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, contact: [webmaster@staff.vault.com](mailto:webmaster@staff.vault.com). If you have advice for Vault.com, contact [feedback@staff.vault.com](mailto:feedback@staff.vault.com).
