# Privacy

## Our Commitment to Privacy:

It is Varsity Tutors LLC’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect through our website [www.varsitytutors.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20100630080707id_/http%3A//www.varsitytutors.com/www.varsitytutors.com) , e-mail, phone or any other communications we have with you. We treat the confidential information you share with us, such as students’ academic performance and any financial information, with the utmost respect. Varsity Tutors will not disclose student records with third parties under any circumstance. We may, however, share a student’s information with our tutors who will be providing tutoring to the student so that they may personalize and tailor the tutoring to the student. 

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Varsity Tutors LLC collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our website. 

Varsity Tutors also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. We do not use such information to identify our visitors, however, and do not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information, as described below. 

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Varsity Tutors’ website choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for our blog at [www.varsitytutors.com/blog.html](https://web.archive.org/web/20100630080707id_/http%3A//www.varsitytutors.com/www.varsitytutors.com/blog.html) to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with us online – by purchasing packages of tutoring hours – are asked to provide additional information, such as the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Varsity Tutors. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below in the section “Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information”. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

## Aggregated Statistics

Varsity Tutors may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website. For instance, we may monitor the most popular blog posts or identify the most frequently visited pages. This information will be used for internal purposes only. We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Varsity Tutors discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process transactions on our behalf or to provide tutoring services, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. We will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Varsity Tutors, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered client on our website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new services, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Varsity Tutors. We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
