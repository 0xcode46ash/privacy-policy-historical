# Privacy Policy | Vampire-Diaries.net | The Vampire Diaries & The Originals Fansite

We’re a fansite, run by fans in their spare time, so we’re not going to go into legalese here. Basically, we don’t sneakily collect your personal information and pass it on to shady people.

The only time we do collect information is in the case of contests, where you know you’re sending us your contact details. We promise you that such information is deleted once contests are over and done with. 

Otherwise the only information we collect is anonymous site stats, so we can get an idea of how many visitors we get and what pages and blog posts are popular. But we can’t identify who you are from it. So, yes, mysterious person googling to find ‘Damon Salvatore shirtless and covered in chocolate’, we have no idea who you are. But we salute your taste and imagination.

As far as cookies go, we use Google Adsense for advertising, which may well drop cookies for their own tracking and ad-targeting purposes, but they’re not anything we have access to, and Google are mostly non-evil.
