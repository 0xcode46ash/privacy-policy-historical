### TRANSFER OF INFORMATION

We may distribute Your submissions to third parties, as permitted pursuant to Our User Policy [CODE HYPERLINK]. Such third parties, with or without Our knowledge or consent, may, in turn, publicly display or publish Your submissions in connection with their own websites and media platforms. When We distribute Your submissions to third parties, We typically include Your account name, but not Your Personal Information, unless You include Your Personal Information in Your submissions. 

We may share Your Personal Information with third parties in order to provide You with services that We offer through the Site, conduct quality assurance testing, facilitate creation of accounts, provide technical and customer support or provide specific services, such as synchronization of Your contacts with other software applications, in accordance with Your instructions. These third parties are prohibited from using Your Personal Information other than to provide the services requested by You.

We may share Your Personal Information with subsidiaries, joint ventures or other companies under a common control (collectively, “ **Affiliates** ”) that We may have now or in the future. If another company acquires Our company or Our assets, that company will possess Your Personal Information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy, or any successor policy.

We may disclose Your Personal Information to third parties in a good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to (a) take action regarding suspected illegal activities; (b) enforce or apply Our User Policy and this Privacy Policy; (c) comply with legal process, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute or court order; or (d) protect Our rights, reputation and property, or that of Our users, affiliates or the public. Please note that We are not required to question or contest the validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar governmental request that We receive.

We may disclose information to third parties relating to user behavior in connection with actual or prospective business relationships with those third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, We may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, certain advertisements.

We may use third party advertising companies in order to issue internet advertisements when You visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including Your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about Your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to You. We do not guarantee or make any representations that We will not transfer Your information to third parties. Additionally, You acknowledge, confirm and assent to such transfer to third parties.

### OTHERS’ INFORMATION

You may choose to provide Us with another person’s e-mail address so that that person may be invited to create an account on this website. We use this information in order to contact and, if necessary, remind that person about the invitation. By providing Us with another person’s e-mail address, You represent to Us that You have obtained the consent of the person concerned with regard to such disclosure to Us of their Personal Information. All invitees are provided with the option not to receive further invitations. We may disclose such information if required to do so in order to comply with legal process, as described above.

### LINKS

The Site may contain links to third party websites to which We have no affiliation. We may share Your Personal Information with those third parties, and are not responsible for their privacy practices. We suggest that You read the privacy policies of all such third party websites.

### CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA

To the extent that You include Personal Information in Your submissions (such as a photo of Yourself), third parties may be able to identify You, associate You with Your user account and/or contact You. Please do not include information in Your submissions that You expect to keep private. In addition, You can reduce the risk of being identified personally by choosing a fictitious account name, though doing so could detract from the credibility of Your submissions. As a registered Vagaro user, You can modify some of Your Personal Information and Your privacy preferences by accessing the “Account” section of the Site.

### Security

Your account is password protected. We use industry standard measures to protect the Personal Information that is stored in Our database. We limit the access to Your Personal Information to those employees and contractors who need access to perform their job function. If You have any questions about the security of the Site, please contact Us. Although We take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosure of information, We cannot assure You, or otherwise guarantee, that Your Personal Information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You hereby acknowledge and agree that Vagaro is not responsible for any intercepted information sent via the internet, and You hereby release Vagaro, its members, agents, employees, affiliates, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims arising out of or related to the use of intercepted information in any unauthorized manner.

### E-MAILS AND OPT-OUT

You may opt-out of receiving notifications from Us by changing Your notification settings under the “Account” tab after You log-on to the Site. Unregistered users who receive e-mails from Us may also opt-out of receiving further e-mails by following the instructions contained in Our e-mails. Despite Your indicated e-mail preferences, We may send You notices of any updates to Our User Agreement or this Privacy Policy.

### TERMS AND MODIFICATIONS TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may modify this Privacy Policy at any time, in Our sole discretion and We will post any new versions on the Site. If We make any material changes in the way that We use Your Personal Information, We will notify You by sending an e-mail to the last e-mail address that You provided to Us and/or by posting notice of the changes on the Site. Any such changes will be effective upon the earlier of five (5) calendar days following Our dispatch of an e-mail notice to You or five (5) calendar days following Our posting of notice of the changes on Our website. These changes will be effective immediately for new users of the Site. Please note that at all times You are solely responsible for updating Your Personal Information and to provide Us with Your most current e-mail address.

In any event, changes to this Privacy Policy may affect Our use of the Personal Information that You provided Us prior to Our notification to You of the changes. If You do not wish to permit changes in Our use of Your Personal Information, You must notify Us, prior to the effective date of the changes, that You wish to deactivate Your account with Us.
