Serving your needs and protecting your personal information are priorities for Virginia Credit Union (referenced herein as “Virginia Credit Union”, “we” or “us”). This notice describes the privacy and data security practices followed by Virginia Credit Union, and explains what types of member information we collect, under what circumstances it may be shared and what choices you have about how it is shared. 

Information we collect   
We collect personal information about members that is necessary to enable us to establish and maintain accounts and to provide services, in each case, as permitted or required by law. The personal information we collect varies depending on the accounts and services you request and use. 

We may collect and (as described below) disclose nonpublic personal information about you that we obtain from the following sources: 

  * Information we receive from you on membership and loan applications and other forms.
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as account balances, payment history and account activity. 
  * Information we receive from consumer-reporting agencies and credit bureaus (that may provide information such as your credit bureau report and your credit score). 
  * Information obtained when we verify the information you provide on applications or other forms, such as information provided by your current or past employers or from other institutions where you conduct or have conducted financial transactions. 



The term “personal information” as used in this privacy statement means information that identifies you personally. We may use information that does not personally identify you to help manage our businesses and to provide us, our affiliates or other companies insight into consumer behavior within our institution and on our web site. We may use this aggregate, anonymous information even if you ask us to limit the disclosure of your personal information as described herein. 

Personal information transmitted to Virginia Credit Union may be used by Virginia Credit Union staff for the sole purpose of servicing your account(s), responding to your questions about your accounts, our services or other information, for legal compliance purposes and as otherwise permitted by law. 

Information we share   
We do not sell or provide personal or account information to third parties for telemarketing or any other independent use. 

**Third Party Vendors.** To offer you financial products and services that help you achieve your financial goals, we may, however, share information with our affiliates and selected companies with which we contract in order to provide services on our behalf: such third party vendors include companies that process transactions, host our online banking site and provide other online banking services, provide printing and mail processing services and otherwise assist us in the operations of Virginia Credit Union. These third party vendors also may include outside financial companies with which we have joint marketing agreements. 

To protect our members' privacy, we work only with third party vendors that agree contractually (a) to maintain strong confidentiality protections; (b) to limit their use of any personal information to which they have access to those functions that are necessary to perform the services that we have contracted with them to provide; and (c) to agree that they will not sell to other third parties the information we provide to them. 

**Affiliates.** We share your personal information with our financial services affiliates only with your consent (e.g., if you notify us that you wish to do business with our insurance affiliate or our title insurance affiliate). 

**Nonaffiliated Third Parties.** We do not share your personal information with nonaffiliated third parties that are not third party vendors (as described above). 

**Information of Former Members.** If you close your relationship with Virginia Credit Union or its affiliates, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law. 

**Sharing of Information as Permitted by Law.** We also may share information about you in other ways as required by law or as permitted to properly manage our business. Examples of ways we may share your information are as follows:

  * To service your account 
  * To protect against fraud 
  * To respond to a subpoena, law or court order 
  * To report to a consumer reporting agency 
  * With your consent 



How we protect your information   
We restrict access to your personal information to those employees who have a business purpose in utilizing your data. Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and member privacy. To protect your nonpublic personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and leading industry practices and we require third party vendors working for us to protect your information. 

Online communication/Internet users   
To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. Applications and forms you submit to us are secured using industry standard encryption. 

You may communicate with us using the secure “Contact Us” form on our web site, the Secure Mail feature within our Online Banking Services or our Secure E-mail Encryption Service. Regular e-mails you may send to us are not secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, we ask that you not send nonpublic personal information, especially Social Security or account numbers, through regular e-mail. However, you may want to call us or write to us via U.S. mail anytime it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. Likewise, we will not transmit through regular e-mail sensitive or nonpublic personal information that can compromise or violate a user’s privacy. 

We use Internet cookies to facilitate your use of the Virginia Credit Union website, our Online Banking Services and other online services that we offer and to enhance the security of the same. A cookie is a data file that a web server places on your computer when you visit a site that, among other things, enables the site to recognize repeat visits from that computer and to display settings that you have previously selected through that computer. To take full advantage of the level of security that Virginia Credit Union offers, your Internet browser must meet certain requirements, such as supporting 128 bit encryption and being set to allow our servers to create a cookie on your system. 

When you visit the Virginia Credit Union site and attempt to use our Online Banking Services to initiate a transaction, we take certain measures to verify your identity. For a full description of these measures, please refer to our [Online Banking Agreement and Electronic Funds Transfer Disclosure](https://www.vacu.org/portals/0/pdfs/onlinebankingagreement.pdf). 

Choices.   
**Limiting Information Sharing with Affiliates.** We release personal information to our financial services affiliates only with your prior consent (see above). 

**Limiting Information we use for Marketing.** We do not release your personal information to affiliates for purposes of marketing. If you establish a direct relationship with one of our financial services affiliates, they may market to you directly – and you may address any requests to cease such marketing directly to such affiliates. Otherwise, to the extent that you receive any marketing materials relating to our affiliates’ services, such communications come directly from Virginia Credit Union and you may exercise your opt-out rights as discussed below. 

**Limiting Sharing with Non-Affiliates.** Except with respect to third party vendors who are performing services on our behalf (as described above), we do not share your personal information with nonaffiliated third parties. 

**E-mail Communication Opt Out.** We may periodically send educational and informational e-mails about our products and services, or those of our affiliates, to members for whom we have recorded e-mail addresses. All members who receive these e-mails have the opportunity to opt out of this service at any time by simply clicking an unsubscribe link in the message. 

**How to Exercise your Privacy Choice.** You may also exercise any of the above-listed choices to opt out by contacting us by e-mail, phone, fax or U.S. mail. If one member who is a holder of a joint account makes a privacy choice, your choice will apply to you joint account holders on the effective date of your choice.

We are not responsible for the data collection and use practices of nonaffiliated third parties to which our web site may link.
