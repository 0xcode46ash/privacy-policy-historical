# Privacy Statement - Virginia Credit Union

Privacy Statement

Serving your needs and protecting your personal information are priorities for Virginia Credit Union. This notice describes the privacy policy and practices followed by Virginia Credit Union, and explains what types of member information we collect and under what circumstances it may be shared. 

Information we collect   
We collect relevant information about members that is needed to establish and maintain accounts and services as permitted or required by law. The member information we collect varies depending on the accounts and services you request and use. 

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you that we collect from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on membership and loan applications and other forms. 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others. 
  * Information we receive from a consumer-reporting agency. 
  * Information obtained when verifying the information you provide on an application or other forms, such as from your current or past employers or from other institutions where you conduct financial transactions. 



Personal information transmitted to Virginia Credit Union may be used by credit union staff to respond to questions about service or information, or to improve the service that we provide. 

Information we share  
We do not sell or provide personal or account information to third parties for telemarketing or any other independent use. To offer you financial products and services that help you achieve your financial goals, we may, however, share information with our affiliates and selected companies that help us provide services, process transactions on your behalf, conduct the operations of our credit union, follow your instructions as you authorize or protect the security of our financial records.

To protect our members' privacy, we work only with companies that agree to maintain strong confidentiality protections and limit the use of information we provide. We do not permit these companies to sell to other third parties the information we provide to them. 

If you close your relationship with Virginia Credit Union or its affiliates, we will not share information we have collected about you, except as permitted or required by law.

How we protect your information   
We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who have a business purpose in utilizing your data. Our employees are trained in the importance of maintaining confidentiality and member privacy. To protect your nonpublic personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations and leading industry practices.

Online communication   
To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. Applications and forms you submit to us are secured using industry standard encryption.

You may communicate with us using the secure Contact Us form on our web site or Secure Mail within Home Banking. Regular e-mails you may send to us are not secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, we ask that you not send nonpublic personal information, especially Social Security or account numbers, through regular e-mail. However, you may want to call us or write to us via U.S. mail anytime it is necessary to provide sensitive or personal information. Likewise, we will not transmit through regular e-mail sensitive or nonpublic personal information that can compromise or violate a userâ€™s privacy.

We may periodically send educational and informational e-mails about our products and services, or those of our affiliates, to members for whom we have recorded e-mail addresses. All members who receive these e-mails have the opportunity to opt out of this service at any time by simply clicking an unsubscribe link in the message. Members may also opt out by contacting us by e-mail, phone, fax or U.S. mail.

Links to other web sites  
On our web site, we provide links to other sites that may be of interest to you. When you leave the Virginia Credit Union web site, the privacy policy may change. You may wish to review any privacy policies posted on other sites you visit.

What you can do to help  
You can help protect the privacy of your information by following these simple guidelines: 

  * Protect your account numbers, card numbers, PINs and passwords. Never keep your PIN with your debit or credit card. 
  * Only disclose your account numbers, card numbers, Social Security number, or other nonpublic personal information to entities or persons that you have authorized to receive it.
  * Never disclose your debit or credit card PIN or online banking logon credentials to anyone, either verbally or in writing.
  * Let us know if your address or phone numbers change. It is important that we know how to reach you if we detect potentially fraudulent or unauthorized activity on your account.
