# Virginia Credit Union > Privacy

Serving your needs and protecting your personal information are priorities for Virginia Credit Union (referenced herein as "Virginia Credit Union," "we," "us" or "our").

For purposes of this Policy, "online" means utilization of an internet communication protocol to view, display, access, receive or transmit information. This Policy covers all our online practices, including, but not limited to our VACU.org website, our Online Banking service, and our Mobile Banking service.

Cookies are pieces of data stored by your Web browser that are useful for expediting page loads or enhancing your online experience when you return to a website.

Although cookies do not reveal our members' identity, we use cookies to help us confirm our members' identities before granting access to our secure online banking system. To take full advantage of the level of security that we offer, your browser must meet certain requirements, such as supporting 128-bit encryption and being set to allow our servers to create a cookie on your system.

We also use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting cookies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and gather aggregated demographic information. We may also contract with third-party companies who use cookies to measure the performance of a marketing effort on our behalf. We prohibit these companies from using this information for their own marketing purposes or from sharing this information with anyone other than Virginia Credit Union. To opt-out of data from being used by Google Analytics, visit <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout>.

We do collect non-identifying information for internal statistical purposes whenever you visit our website. This statistical information is collected in an effort to better enrich the online experience of our visitors, to assess what information is most and least important to our visitors, to analyze the effectiveness of our ads, and for determining whether our content and/or its presentment is useful and relevant to visitors of our website.

## What happens when you send information to us or transact with us online

Whenever you submit information to us using methods we make available to you on our website, we protect your information using administrative and technical processes along with strong industry standard encryption recommended for financial institutions. There is a serious risk that your information could be intercepted if you send information using a method outside of our website, such as sending an email from your home email server or posting a message to us through a social media website. To send us a secure message, you should only use the method provided on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/About_VACU/Contact_Us.aspx) web page, or through our encrypted email service when instructed by us, or the method provided after logging on to our Online or Mobile Banking services.

## Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

Unless verifiable consent acceptable to us is obtained from a parent or legal guardian, we do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information obtained from our website about children under 13 years of age.

We are not responsible for the content, practices or policies of any other party or any non-VACU website you visit, including any social media sites in which we display information, or any website whose link appears within our website, and regardless of any affiliation we may share with any other entity. Before providing any personal or identifiable information, you should first review the policies of any website you are visiting. The fact that there is a link between our website and that of another website does not represent an endorsement by us of the content and any product, service, or program contained on any other website. Ads we place on other websites may contain a "tag," which is a code that tells us that our ad was reviewed at the sponsoring website. Tags do not contain personal or identifiable information and are only a marketing tool for measuring the effectiveness of placing our ads on other websites.
