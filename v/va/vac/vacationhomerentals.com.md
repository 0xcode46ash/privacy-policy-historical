# Vacation Home Rentals - vacation rental homes, villas, condos and more!

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about the types of information gathered by Vacation Home Rentals, Inc. ("VHR", "we", "us") when you use the VacationHomeRentals.com service (the "Service"), how we use and safeguard that information, and the degree to which you may control the collection and use of that information. Through the Service, VHR provides a venue for vacation rental property owners or managers ("Owners") to advertise their vacation rental properties to potential renters, and for potential renters ("Renters") to find a suitable vacation rental property.

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If you are a registered user of the Service, we will attempt to inform you of any material changes by email. Otherwise, you may always view the most recent Privacy Policy on the VHR website. Your continued use of the Service constitutes your agreement with the existing and updated policies. 

**Information Collection, Use, and Tracking**

We will not collect any personally identifiable information about you unless you choose to provide that information to us. Most areas of the Service are accessible without registration or the need to disclose any personally identifiable information. However, Owners will be required to register with the Service, and, following the free trial period, purchase a subscription in order to advertise properties on the Service. In order to register as an Owner and complete the subscription process, you will be required to provide your name, address, telephone number, email address, and credit card information. All personal financial information you provide to us in order for us to complete the subscription process will be securely collected and provided to a third party vendor, who will process payments and complete transactions.

Owners will be required to create a public profile, which will include your name and telephone number, and may include other optional information. Please be aware that information in your public profile may be viewed by the general public.

VHR does not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from, or allow registration by, persons under 18 years old. If you are under 18 years of age, you are not authorized to create an account on the Service, but you may utilize those portions of the Service that do not require the collection of personally identifiable information.

 _Analytics_

We may use third party services (eg Google Analytics) to automatically collect and store certain information about your interaction with the Service, including IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamps, and related data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, solely to improve the quality of our products and services. We also use cookies to make it easier for you to use the Service. You are free to decline cookies, but by doing so you may not be able to take full advantage of all of our services. 

_Cookies_

We use cookies to store your preferences and to record session information. A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer when you visit our website. The cookie enables the Service to readily recognize you as you move through it or return on subsequent visits. Cookies also allow us to make sure that only your browser can exchange information regarding your account with our servers. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while using the Service.

 _Email Notices_

When you register as an Owner, we will send you a welcome email which includes welcome information about the Service and your account. We will send also you emails with information about any inquires you may receive from Renters regarding a property you have advertised. You may also request to receive periodic emails from us notifying you about new or upcoming VHR products or services. If you later decide you no longer wish to receive these emails, you may opt-out as instructed in each email. Be advised, however, that you may not opt-out of receiving emails from us related to inquiries from Renters, technical support requests, or updates to the VHR Terms of Service or Privacy Policy.

 _Newsletters_

VHR gives you the opportunity to subscribe to newsletters by providing us with your email address. We will send each newsletter to the email address you have provided. If you later decide you no longer wish to receive these newsletters, you may opt-out as instructed in each email.

If you forget your account login information, you may request that we send it to the email address associated with your account. Please take steps to keep your account information secure to prevent unauthorized access.

**California Do Not Track Notice**

VHR does not track its users over time and across third party websites, and therefore does not respond to Do Not Track signals sent by your browser or mobile application. VHR does not authorize the collection by third parties of personally identifiable information from VHR users.

**Disclosure**

We understand how highly our users value the privacy and security of their personally identifiable information. We will disclose information collected from and about you only as follows: (1) to our related companies, service providers, and Affiliates (as defined below), to enable them to fulfill a product or service request or to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (2) as necessary if we believe that there has been a violation of our Terms of Service or of our rights or the rights of any third party; and (3) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law. 

_Disclosure to Affiliates_

VHR uses third party marketers ("Affiliates") to assist in marketing and promoting the Service and the advertised properties. In connection with these efforts, we share with our Affiliates certain information about Owners and their advertised properties, including text, photographs, and the Owner’s public profile. We do not disclose any personal financial information to Affiliates, nor do Affiliates collect any personal financial information. 

_Public Disclosure_

Please keep in mind that any information you choose to include in your public profile and advertisements will be visible to the general public and may be collected and used by others. Consequently, we urge you to be cautious in deciding what and how much information you choose to disclose.

**Links To Third Party Sites**

The Service may contain links to third party websites. These sites may have their own terms of service and privacy policies which do not apply to VHR or the Service.

**Business Transitions**

In the event VHR goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, any personally identifiable information we have on record will likely be among the assets transferred. The transferred information will remain subject to the provisions of this Privacy Policy or any subsequent updated versions.

**Information Security**

We employ encryption and other security measures to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. We take commercially reasonable steps to protect this information by using secure-socket-layer ("SSL") to protect the transmission of such information. However, please be advised that while we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent unauthorized access from occurring. Please take steps to maintain the security of your account information.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, VHR, or the Service, please contact us, we’d love to hear from you.
