When you are browsing our website, you are not required to provide any personal information unless and until you choose to create an account with vayama, make a purchase or sign up for one of our other services.

We use a variety of technologies including session data, cookies, log files, and web beacons to better understand how our website is navigated, how many visitors click on certain pages, how long and how frequently visitors visit our website, the types of searches that occur, the browsers and computer operating systems used by our visitors and the Internet Protocol addresses from which visitors connect to our website.

### Web Beacons

We and our third-party tracking service partners employ a software technology called Web beacons that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, Web beacons are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information. 

We may also use Web beacon in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice and Opt-out.”
