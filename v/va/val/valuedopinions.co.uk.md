Research Now conducts surveys on a variety of topics. Clients will give Research Now a brief setting out the types of individuals from whom we should seek answers. The brief will include matters such as age, ethnic background, qualifications and occupation. Research Now will review its database and then send out invites to an online survey to people falling within the client brief. 

Research Now provides clients with data files containing anonymous answers to survey questions.  No personal data in respect of those individuals responding to a survey will be given to clients of Research Now. 

Research Now will, from time to time, assist research organisations in other jurisdictions to survey people in the countries in which it operates. In these circumstances it will either send you a survey to complete, the answers of which will be summarised, anonymised and sent to the client or they will prepare questions for you to answer directly. In such circumstances your personal data are not transferred to third parties.

## Advanced Cookies 

The advanced cookie tracks the online patterns of Valued Opinions Members. The advanced cookie, which may be placed by Valued Opinions or in conjunction with a third party, incorporates a key which can identify tags contained in certain online content relating to our clients and their products and services. 

If an Valued Opinions Member views a page containing any content that includes the tag, the key will send Valued Opinions an update confirming that the Member has viewed the page containing this content. Certain Web pages or Web-based advertisements that you view may be tracked, and in some cases, this tracking data may be combined with survey answers that you provide. For example, when you visit or click on our third-party marketing and reward partners' Web sites or online advertisements these events are recorded by one of our technology partners, which in turn reports the data to us. We provide that data directly, or combine it with the other information that you provide us with, such as your survey responses and demographic information (but not with your personally identifiable information), to provide market research analysis to our Rewards Partners and Marketing Partners, for example on the effectiveness of their Web sites and advertisements. You can opt out of our technology partners' own data collection and ad targeting here: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>; here: <http://aboutads.info/choice>s or here <http://preferences.truste.com/truste>. If you delete cookies on your browser after opting out, you will have to opt out again. You can opt out of the provision of such data from our data partners to us and out of receiving such advanced cookies on your computer via Valued Opinions by emailing us using the contact form on: <http://www.valuedopinions.co.uk/contact-information/>. Of course, if a cookie is one that an Valued Opinions Member may receive from a third party, regardless of the Member's participation in the Valued Opinions, then opting out with Valued Opinions will not prevent the Member from receiving that third party's cookie. We neither have access to, nor control over, third-party cookies or how they may be used. Likewise, if the cookie is placed by a third party, we have no control over the nature of the content with which these tags are included. If you would like more information about third-party use of cookies and about your option [not to accept these cookies, please click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). Your access to our Web sites will not be affected if you do not accept cookies placed by third parties.
