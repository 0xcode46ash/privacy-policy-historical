# Privacy Policy | Values.com

Effective December 16, 2015

Welcome! This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and disclosure of information collected online by our website at www.values.com (including any subpages or mobile versions thereof) or any other website where this policy is posted (each, the “ **Site** ”). This Privacy Policy (the “ **Policy** ”) forms an agreement between you and Foundation for a Better Life, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit (“ **FBL** ,” “ **us** ,” “ **our** ,” or “ **we** ”). Through your continued use of our Site, you consent to the practices described in this Policy.

This Policy describes what information we may collect, how we may collect it, with whom we may share it, and other matters related to the information we collect from our Site, including your choices regarding collection and disclosure to third parties. This Policy is incorporated into our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-use) and may include terms that are defined in that agreement. Unless stated otherwise, this Policy only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you online through our Site.

Please note, for some services or features, we may collect and transfer information to a service provider or, where allowed by applicable law, to educators, recruiters, our affiliates or other entities. Should you arrive at a third-party site or service when using our Site, please take a moment to review the privacy policies of third-party sites before you disclose information to them.

### What Personal Information do we collect  
and how do we use it?

For the purposes of this policy, “ **Personal Information** ” means any information that can be used to identify you as an individual, including your: full name; address; online contact information; telephone number; any persistent identifier that can be used to recognize you over time and across different services; precise geolocation information; and any information about an individual linked to such identifying information.

##### When you contact us through the Site

On our Site, we request your name and email address directly from you if you contact us through our “contact us” form. We will use Personal Information collected from the “contact us” form only as necessary to respond to your inquiry.

##### When you register on our website

We collect additional Personal Information when a user registers with our Site. For example, if you choose to sign up using your email address, we will collect your email, name, and the location you designate. If you sign up using a social media plugin, we will receive the information indicated by that service, such as your public profile, friend list, tweets, followers, and/or email address. We collect this information so that we can send you our daily inspirational emails and monthly newsletters, other information you may request, or to allow you to participate in various initiatives we may feature on our Site.

##### When you submit User Content

When you submit User Content to our Site, such as a story about a personal hero, a photo and other information submitted through the “Create your own Billboard” feature, or a personal story, we will collect, store, and may make public any information you provide. In addition, our Site may facilitate sharing of information you post, or information you share through social media, on our Site or elsewhere (for example, if you “tweet” content to one of the Twitter hashtags for which content is featured in widgets on our Site, that content may appear within the widget). Please do not submit any information through these features or otherwise post content on our Site, unless you wish to make this content public.

##### If you request materials from us

If you request materials from us, such as educational resources or media versions of our Content, we may request additional information from you. We may request your name, mailing address, phone number, organizational affiliation, and other information necessary to process your transaction. This information will be used only in the context of your request and not associated with your profile or shared, except as may be necessary for processing.

##### Third party sites and services

Please be aware, certain services available on or through our Site may be provided by third parties. You may also visit other third party sites through links on our Site. These third parties are not bound by this policy and may have privacy policies of their own governing the use and disclosure of your Personal Information. Please read any policies of third parties before you provide Personal Information to them.

### Cookies and online tracking

Our Site may use cookies, web beacons and similar tracking technologies. These technologies are widely used for security, to learn about and improve upon how users navigate a website, or to enable certain features. Cookies are small data files that are transferred to your hard drive when your browser settings permit the acceptance of cookies. Similar technologies, such as web beacons or pixel tags function through the use of small files, such as a GIF or PNG, which are opened on a page or in an email. The request for these files from a server can reveal certain information, such as your browser type, IP address, and other information. To learn more about cookies and similar tracking technologies, and how they can affect your privacy, visit [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

By tracking how and when you use our Site, these technologies help us determine which features and content on our Site are most important to our visitors. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can turn off cookies through your browser’s settings; however, this may eliminate our ability to provide you with a personalized or user-friendly experience on our Site.

Please note, most modern browsers include a “do not track” feature that may help protect your privacy. However, because there is not yet a defined response to do-not-track requests, our Site does not respond to your browser’s do-not-track request.

Our Site may use cookies provided by website analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us better understand how our Site is used. To learn more about, or to opt-out of Google’s analytic and marketing services, visit [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/tos.html), the [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html), or [Google Analytics Opt- out](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en-GB).

### With whom may we share your  
Personal Information?

We generally do not share the Personal Information you provide us, including your registration information, except as described in this Privacy Policy. However, if you provide us information about a hero, share a story, create your own billboard, or otherwise provide information through features intended to share content on our Site, your information will be available to the general public on our Site or through our social media channels. Please do not share any information through these features that you do not want public.

We may share a limited amount of your Personal Information with service providers who provide certain services on our behalf, or in the circumstances noted below. For example, we may share certain Personal Information we collect with third parties such as providers of data hosting or processing services, or other service providers. We may also occasionally share Personal Information with our related entities (e.g. for special joint initiatives of our organizations) or we may occasionally share with third parties who have information we believe would be of interest to you.

Further, we may share Personal Information we possess as part of a sale or transfer our business, or substantially all of our assets. To the extent permitted by laws, we may share Personal Information if we need to protect the interests of FBL, our customers, property, or the public. Similarly, we may share Personal Information with governmental authorities or otherwise in response to a legal request that we believe requires us to do so. We will share any such information to the extent we believe that request requires. Legal requests include, for example, search warrants, subpoenas, and other court orders. We may also receive legal requests or orders from jurisdictions outside the United States, in which case you consent for your Personal Information to be transferred to the applicable country.

### How can I access, update, or delete my Personal Information?

If your Personal Information was posted on our Site by a third party, for example through the personal hero submission feature, we will accommodate any reasonable request to remove your information. To do so, please contact us at the address listed below.

You may also access or update any Personal Information we hold about you by sending a letter or email using the contact information listed below. We will respond to reasonable requests for access or revision and will provide access to the extent required or allowed by law. However we may decide not to grant access or make revisions where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to the individual’s privacy in any given case, or when the rights of others would be violated by granting the access.

### Is my Personal Information secured?

We use reasonable security measures to protect any Personal Information held by FBL. We implement and regularly review various physical, procedural and technological safeguards that we believe will keep your Personal Information secure.

### International guests

If you are accessing this Site from outside of the United States, you consent to the transfer of your information to the United States, and the processing, use, and sharing of your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Regardless of where your information is collected or transferred, the information will be treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

### Rights of parents and children

Our Site is intended for general audiences, such as educators, parents, and the general public, but is not directed to children. If a child under the age of 13 were to use our Site, because our Site is designed for general audiences, the personal information collected from the child would be the same as that collected from adults, as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Parents should be aware that our Site may include features by which our users may share content with others on our Site or via social media. If a child were to use these features of our Site, the child could potentially disclose personal information to other users of all ages via those services. Please be aware of any privacy policies of these third party social media sites before allowing your child to use them.

Parents may review, edit, request the deletion, or prevent further collection or use of their children's personal information.  Parents may also choose to agree to the collection and use of their child’s information, but not allow disclosure of such information to third parties unless it is inherently part of the Site.  Parents may request any of these actions, or make inquiries regarding our privacy practices, by sending an email or letter to us at the address below.

To the extent required by California Law, we permit minors under the age of 18 to request the deletion of any content or information that the minor has made available through our Site to other users of the Site. To request that information you have made available on our Site be removed, please send a letter or email to the address below with (i) your name, (ii) a complete description of the content you would like removed, and (iii) the web address(es) of the content you would like removed. Please be aware that our fulfillment of this request does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information you have posted on our Site.

### Limitation of liability

By providing us with any Personal Information, you expressly and unconditionally release and hold harmless [randomactsofkindness.org](https://www.randomactsofkindness.org/), its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, related companies and their respective shareholders, owners, members, directors, officers, employees and agents (collectively, the “Releasees”) from any and all liability for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected Personal Information. In addition, while we take reasonable steps to prevent third party companies from making unauthorized use of your Personal Information, we cannot be held liable for any injuries, loss or damage of any kind arising from or in connection with the use and/or misuse of your collected Personal Information by those third parties.

### Changes to this policy

This policy may change from time to time. We will post the most current version of this policy on our website with the effective date. Your continued use of the website means you consent to the terms of any new Policy.
