**Our Commitment to Your Privacy:**

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy statement explains the privacy practices relating to our www.valueline.com web site (the "Web Site"). 

**What Personal Information We Collect:**

It is our policy to collect personal information that our members and visitors knowingly provide to us, and we take precautions to protect the information that we receive from you. 

We may require you to complete a registration form in order to use certain features of this Web Site. When you register, you are only required to give us a user name, password, telephone number, and e-mail address. However, we may also ask for other identifying information (such as your name and street address) as well as other demographic data (such as your age, gender, and income). In the event you purchase a product or service from us, we will also require your credit card information and other shipping and billing data. 

If you are using our portfolio-tracking feature, news services or any other feature, we collect and store whatever information you voluntarily provide. 

Certain additional information may be collected in connection with managing your mutual fund accounts, which you can access through www.valueline.com. Mutual fund information is the subject of a separate Privacy Statement that appears in that separate and secure portion of the Web Site. 

**How We Use the Information We Collect:**

Some uses of your personal information are: 

  * To ensure that our Web Site is protected against unauthorized access;
  * To send you information about products and services we think might interest you;
  * To notify you of updates to our products and services; 
  * To assist in the processing of any transactions between you and us;
  * To deliver products and services you may order from us; and
  * To use e-mail to answer your questions, to diagnose computer problems, or to administer the Web Site.



We recognize that any information you input into the portfolio-tracking feature is of special concern to you. We keep this information confidential and do not disclose it to unaffiliated parties. 

**Sharing Our Subscriber and Customer Lists:**

As is the practice among many publishers, we may make available to unaffiliated parties information that you provide us when ordering a subscription, product, or service. If you do not want such information shared with third parties, please email us at [infoprivacy@valueline.com](mailto:infoprivacy@valueline.com) or write us at: Information Privacy Manager, c/o Value Line Publishing, 220 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017, and indicate your wishes in this regard. 

**Data Security:**

We take many precautions to protect your information from unauthorized third party access, alteration, theft, or misuse. For example, we use standard on-line security measures such as encryption and authentication to protect your credit card data. Regrettably, no computer system or online transaction is 100% secure, and we therefore cannot guarantee the security of the information you share with us. 

**IP Addresses and Cookies:**

Cookies are files that contain information created by a web server that can be stored on your hard disk for future use. We use cookies only to facilitate automated activity, store and track passwords, and determine appropriate solicitations by tracking your movement through the Web Site. Cookies are destroyed whenever you log off the Web Site, shut down your browser or reboot your computer. Your web browser will allow you to disable cookies, but you will not be able to successfully log on to and participate in many features of our Web Site if you do so. Therefore, you will always remain in guest status if cookies are disabled. 

In some cases, we may automatically (i.e., not via registration) collect technical information when you connect to our Web Site that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using, and the IP address from which you are linked to our Web Site. We use this information to help keep this website running smoothly and to analyze how visitors use our Web Site. 

**Links:**

This Web Site contains links to other web sites. We have no control over and are not responsible for the privacy policies of such sites. Whenever you link to another web site, you may be asked to provide registration or other information. Please note that any information that you provide is going to a third party, and therefore you should familiarize yourself with that party's privacy policy. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by Value Line's Web Site. 

**Changes to Our Privacy Policy:**

If our privacy policy changes, we will notify all users by posting the new policy on our Web Site. Please check back here periodically to review our latest policy. 

**How You Can Access or Correct Your Information:**

You can request a copy of the personally identifiable information that we have collected about you via the Internet (or correct any factual inaccuracies) by contacting our Information Privacy Manager at the address below. 

**How to Contact Us About Privacy Matters:**

If you would like to contact us for any reason concerning our privacy practices, please write or email us at the following address: Information Privacy Manager, c/o Value Line Publishing, 220 East 42nd Street, New York, NY 10017.
