The content (images and text) placed by Valvoline at www.valvoline.com is copyrighted. You may download the content only for your personal, non-commercial use. The content may not be otherwise copied and may not be modified.

**Accuracy of information**

Valvoline will use reasonable efforts to include accurate and up-to-date information but makes no warranties or representations as to its accuracy or completeness; therefore, you should assume that information is current only as of the date it is posted to the site. Valvoline shall not be liable for damages of any kind arising out of your access or inability to access www.valvoline.com or your reliance on the information in www.valvoline.com.

**Information Collection and Use**

Valvoline takes care to respect the privacy of its online visitors and is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to third parties in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement.

Information that can identify an online visitor is collected at www.valvoline.com only when voluntarily offered by the visitor. Information may be shared among Valvoline Inc. (and all its subsidiary companies and brands) as it is our goal to make your visits to our sites easy and enjoyable. Valvoline Inc. may disclose user information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) Valvoline Inc. rights or property, other site users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Valvoline may disclose user information when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

Our Internet web site does collect nonpersonal information from online visitors in order to track the total number of visitors to the site in aggregate form and identify the type of Internet browser and operating system.

**Order**

We request information from the user on our order forms for Valvoline Inc. merchandise. Here a user must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. Contact information may also be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-in/out processes described on or linked to each form.

**Cookies**

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of data that a web site transfers to a user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site.

**Log Files**

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. We sometimes use an outside shipping company to ship orders and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When the user signs up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Links**

Clicking on certain images, or links, within www.valvoline.com will take you into other web sites owned by third parties, the content and privacy practices for which Valvoline Inc. will take no responsibility. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

**Contests**

From time to time our site requests information from users via contests. Participation in these contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as ZIP Code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Contact information may also be used for marketing and promotional purposes and is subject to the opt-in/out processes described on or linked to each form.

**Share This Page/Refer a Friend**

If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about pages of our site or promotions, we ask them for the friend's name and e-mail address. Valvoline will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting them to visit the site. Valvoline stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact Valvoline to request the removal of this information from the database.

**A special note to parents and caregivers**

Children 18 years of age or under visiting www.valvoline.com should ask their parent's or guardian's permission before sending any personal information, such as their names, home addresses or e-mail addresses.

Valvoline does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever, unless required by law.

Parents should become knowledgeable about software and other tools so they can assure that children's use of the Internet reflects parental preferences and requirements. We also allow parents to request at any time that information collected about their child be removed from our database. If you would like to deactivate your child's account, please send an e-mail message to fill out our [**form**](https://web.archive.org/pages/contact.asp) with your child's information requesting that their account be cancelled.

**Security**

This web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our order forms asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing." While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. 

**Choice/Opt-out/Opt-in**

Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, can choose not to have their e-mail address included on our lists.

Users who no longer wish to receive our e-mails or promotional materials may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link located at the bottom of the communication or by visiting our [**eNewsletter Subscription**](http://www.valvoline.com/pages/newsletters.asp) page and editing their preferences.

On occasion, Valvoline Inc. will provide opt-in opportunities to our users in order to receive product updates, promotional opportunities, and other information from Valvoline Inc. or other parties. At the point of signing up, it is clearly disclosed to users of our site when their information is being used or collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether they should proceed with services that involve an outside party or not.

**Changes to this Policy**

Valvoline reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of the Guidelines at any time. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. By accessing www.valvoline.com, you agree to the contents of these Guidelines.
