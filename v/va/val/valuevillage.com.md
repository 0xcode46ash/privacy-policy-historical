What Personal Information Do We Collect, and How Is It Used?  
We collect certain information (a) when you voluntarily give us information; and (b) automatically when you visit our Sites.  As described below, we may combine different sources of information, and may participate in interest-based advertising.

 _Information you give us_

.  We collect personal information, such as first and last name, address, e-mail address and telephone number, volunteered by our customers and visitors to our Sites, such as when you participate in a survey and/or website registrations. We collect information you provide when you participate in programs such as the Super Savers Club Card program. Any personal information we collect is used for internal review and is either discarded or used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes such as those described below.

In those instances where we do collect personal information, you have a choice about what information to provide to us. Examples of when you voluntarily submit this kind of information include when you answer our polls, fill out the registration page or send us feedback.

The information collected is used to send email reminders to our users and information about promotions or other information we think will be of interest. If, for any reason, you would like to be removed from our email list, you can contact us in one of two ways. At any time, users can unsubscribe by simply visiting the registration section of our Sites and clicking the unsubscribe button. With each email sent, users also have the option to opt-out of future mailings by simply sending a return email stating this intention.

 _Information collected automatically_

.  In addition to the information we collect directly from you, we may receive or collect some information automatically when you visit the Sites or engage with other online content.  For example, we may receive the IP address of the computer or other device you use to access the Sites, which may tell us general geographic location.  We also monitor and track usage of our Sites, viewing and traffic patterns, customer behavior and other similar information.  For more information on automatic collection of information from our Sites, see Use of Cookies, below.

Combined information.  We use aggregate information collected automatically as well as personal information you provide to us for internal business and administrative purposes, including to improve our Sites, our operations and our customer service.  We may also use the information to better communicate with you and enhance our customer service and your shopping experience.

Online advertising. We may use cookies and similar tools in combination with other information you provide to us to participate in interest-based or targeted advertising.  This means that you may see ads on the Sites or other parties' websites or received emails from us based on the way you browse our Sites and other parties’ websites.  For more information on your choices regarding our collection of information and advertising, see Use of Cookies.

Protecting Your Privacy  
As part of our commitment to ensuring the privacy of our customers, we do not sell or exchange names or any other personally identifiable information about our online customers with third parties, unless they are subsidiaries, affiliates or trusted business partners. Savers uses industry-standard security techniques at the Sites to help protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information we collect. 

Children’s Privacy  
Our Site is a general audience site that is not directed at children under the age of 13. Savers does not knowingly ask for or collect personal information from children under 13 without verifiable parental consent.  If Savers learns that a child under the age of 13 has submitted personal information to us without parental consent, we will take all reasonable measures to delete such information and/or not use such information for any purpose.  If you become aware of any personal information we have collected from a child under 13, please contact us. 

Use of Cookies  
Cookies are pieces of information that are stored on your computer and are used for record keeping purposes. We use cookies or similar technologies to make visiting and using our Sites easier. Cookies can help us see which parts of our Sites are the most or least popular and provide us direction to improve our customer's online experience. We may also use them to help us provide you with a customized experience and interest-based or targeted ads and promotions, as described above.  You may stop or limit our ability to collect information from you when you visit our Sites by disabling “cookies” or using other privacy features that may be available on your website browser.

Do Not Track  
Do Not Track (DNT) is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers, allowing users to opt out of tracking by websites and online services. At the present time, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has not yet established universal standards for recognizable DNT signals and therefore, Savers and the Sites do not recognize DNT.

Links to Other Sites  
The Sites provide links to several other third party websites. While we choose our links carefully, we cannot take any responsibility for the content of linked websites, or for the privacy policies of websites we link to. Since we do not control these websites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party websites prior to any use.
