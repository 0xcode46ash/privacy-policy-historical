You may do so on our website or by responding to the opt-out option which is included with each direct marketing communication that we send. 

**Anonymisation**

Research Now conducts surveys on a variety of topics. Clients will give Research Now a brief setting out the types of individuals from whom we should seek answers. The brief will include matters such as age, ethnic background, qualifications and occupation. Research Now will review its database and then send out invites to an online survey to people falling within the client brief. Research Now provides clients with data files containing anonymous answers to survey questions. No personal information in respect of those individuals responding to a survey will be given to clients of Research Now. Research Now will, from time to time, assist research organisations in other jurisdictions to survey people in the countries in which it operates. In these circumstances it will either send you a survey to complete, the answers of which will be summarised, anonymised and sent to the client or they will prepare questions for you to answer directly. In such circumstances your personal information is not transferred to third parties. 

**How we protect your personal information?**

Research Now takes reasonable steps to protect your personal information from unauthorised access, use, disclosure or loss. These steps include the use of encryption systems, passwords and firewalls. 

**Disclosure of your personal information**

We do not pass on personal information to organisations for whom we do market research, whether for research or marketing purposes. However, we do pass on information collected during surveys in a de-identified aggregated form to assist our clients in better product offerings. We will not supply any sensitive information about you to any third party without your consent. Personal information may be shared between members of the group of companies of which Research Now is now a part.
