In general, you may browse our Internet site anonymously. However, when asked to value an item we require the collection of some personally identifying information, such as your name, address, and, when appropriate, your credit information. For transactions over the STGEORGEVALUATIONS.COM web-site involving particularly confidential information, such as credit card numbers and accounting information, STGEORGEVALUATIONS.COM will employ accepted transmission and storage protocols, such as encryption, to prevent this information from being disclosed. This means that when you type in sensitive information such as credit card details, it will be automatically converted into codes before being securely sent to us over the Internet. This information will be used for processing transactions but may also be used for internal data processing, such as compiling statistical information about your interests and the use of our Internet site. As a service to you, we may also use this information to customize the content we offer.

In order to provide you with our valuation certificate and timely notice about upcoming offers and events, STGEORGEVALUATIONS.COM may send you email notices. At the bottom of each email you will be provided with the option to opt out of such notifications by email.
