| 

The effective date of this Agreement is February 9, 2012. 

At ValueAppeal, your privacy is important, and so we would like to explain to you what information we collect when you visit www.valueappeal.com (the “Site”), why we collect such information, how such information is used, and under what circumstances we share such information with others. We would also like to explain your options to access and control your information, and data security procedures and practices, and other matters. 

Because we want you to understand the collection and use of data that is necessary and possible on the ValueAppeal platform, and to show our respect for your privacy, we have established this privacy policy (this “Privacy Policy”). WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND WILL PROVIDE NOTIFICATION OF ANY MATERIAL CHANGE OR AMENDMENT VIA A POSTING TO THE SITE. YOUR USE OF THE SITE INDICATES YOUR ASSENT TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES OR AMENDMENTS. USE OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT NOW IS SUBJECT TO THE PRIVACY POLICY IN EFFECT AT THE TIME SUCH INFORMATION IS USED. YOU MAY CONTACT US WITH ANY QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY AT [PRIVACY@VALUEAPPEAL.COM](mailto:privacy@valueappeal.com). 

##  Collected Information 

In the registration process, we collect registration information from our users, including name, user name, and password, and contact information such as email and mailing address (the "User-Submitted Information"). The User-Submitted Information is used to provide users with access to a rich collection of on-line resources, including without limitation on- and off-line advertising services, promotional pricing services, and the ability to contact, merchants and service providers from whom users seek services (collectively, the "Service”). User-Submitted Information is used to authenticate users and recall their profile pages, and to provide users with information on Service updates. ValueAppeal does not share any User-Submitted Information not otherwise available from third party resources with any third parties except in very limited circumstances as set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

In the operation of the Service, we collect and store information in order to provide communications and other services. This data is gathered from a variety of sources and enables us to provide and improve the Service. ValueAppeal will continue to make your data available to you on the ValueAppeal platform as long as you are a user according to the terms and conditions of the ValueAppeal Terms of Service (as amended from time to time) (the “Terms of Service”). Please consult the Terms of Service as well as this Privacy Policy to understand your rights and responsibilities as a user of the ValueAppeal platform. 

**Information such as your screen name, full name, profile photo, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews may be shown by users to their friends or other users primarily in conjunction with reviews or other content you have contributed. In addition, we may sell your reviews to third parties, in which case your provided information (e.g., Screen name, first name and last initial, profile photo, city/state/neighborhood, and any personally identifiable information you have included in your reviews) may be shown to users of such third party web sites.**

Your full name and email address may also be used when you send an email notification to a friend (such as in making a recommendation, an invitation, or when sharing a review). We may also use your email address to send you updates or news regarding our Site, but you may choose to not receive email of this type by accessing the "Account" tab of the Site and updating your notification settings. Additionally, we use your email address to contact you on behalf of your friends (such as when someone sends you a personal message). 

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, email address) via reviews, messages, forums, postings, or in other areas of the ValueAppeal site, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by third parties and may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of ValueAppeal. PLEASE DO NOT POST ON THE WEBSITE OR ANY OTHER AREAS ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT YOU EXPECT TO KEEP PRIVATE. 

ValueAppeal may also collect and analyze from visitors and users certain information regarding the use of the Service and Site activity. Information collected may include but is not limited to Site traffic volume, frequency of visits, type and time of transactions, type of browser and operating system, IP address, requested URL, referring URL, etc. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, administer the Site, and improve the quality and types of service delivered. In addition, we use this information to perform statistical analyses of user behavior and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, their advertising banners. 

##  Shared Information 

We may share your personal or business information as described below: 

_Affiliated Businesses We Do Not Control:_ We anticipate that we may become affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them. In certain situations, these businesses may operate stores at the Site, sell items to you through the website or offer you products or services that may be of interest to you. In other situations, ValueAppeal may provide services or sell products jointly with affiliated businesses. You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with a particular opportunity or transaction, and we will share user information, except for User-Submitted Information not otherwise available from third party resources, that is related to such opportunity or transaction with that affiliated business. 

_Agents:_ We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information, except for User-Submitted Information not otherwise available from third party resources, with them to provide products or services to you. Examples include sending email, analyzing data, and providing user services. Without your permission, ValueAppeal's agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. 

_Business profiles:_ Business profile information including business name, address, phone number and email address is displayed to users publicly in connection with the Service. As part of our website and the service, you will receive from ValueAppeal and other users and partners of ValueAppeal email and other communication relating to your business and/or the products and services you offer. 

_Business Transfers:_ In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information, except for User Submitted Information not otherwise available from third party resources, is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if ValueAppeal, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the event that ValueAppeal goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of ValueAppeal may continue to use your information as set forth in this policy. 

_Protection of ValueAppeal and Others:_ We may release personal and business information, including but not limited to User-Submitted Information, when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with law; enforce or apply our Terms of Service and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of ValueAppeal, our employees, our users, or others. This includes, without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

_With Your Consent:_ Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personally identifiable individual information may be shared with third parties, and will be given the option to prevent the sharing of this information. 

##  Customer Surveys 

ValueAppeal may periodically conduct both business and individual customer surveys. We encourage our customers to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us to improve the types of services we offer and how we provide them to you. Your personal information and responses will remain strictly confidential, even if a third party conducts the survey. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary. 

We take the information we receive from individuals responding to our customer surveys and aggregate it with the responses from other customers to create broader, generic responses to the survey questions (such as gender, age, residence, hobbies, education, employment, industry sector, or other demographic information). We then use the aggregated information to improve the quality of the Service to you, and to develop new services and products. This aggregated, non-personally-identifying information may be shared with third parties. 

##  Cookies 

Like most websites, ValueAppeal and the Site require cookies to function properly. Cookies are small text files that reside on a user's computer and identify you as a unique user. We use cookies to refine our site and simplify the user experience. For example, the use of cookies allows registered users to enter the Site without explicitly typing in their email address and password every time. You should be aware that ValueAppeal cannot control the use of cookies by advertisers or any information advertisers may gather from their use of cookies. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept the cookie feature; however, you should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you certain features (e.g., customized delivery of information) available on the Site. For example, Google, as a third party vendor to ValueAppeal, uses cookies to serve advertisements on the Site. Google’s use of its DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you and other ValueAppeal users based on your and other ValueAppeal’s users’ visits to the Site and other sites on the Internet. You may opt out of the use of the DART cookie by visiting the ad and content network privacy policy at <http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/index.aspx>
