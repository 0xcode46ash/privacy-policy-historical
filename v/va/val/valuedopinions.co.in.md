 **Sensitive Personal Information**

Certain personal information is categorised by the 1998 Act as "Sensitive Personal Data" as defined by the 1998 Act.

In some circumstances, Research Now provides you with the opportunity to inform us of your sensitive personal data, unless we are permitted to process such sensitive personal data under the provisions of the 1998 Act, we will ask for your consent.

 **Anonymisation**

Research Now conducts surveys on a variety of topics. Clients will give Research Now a brief setting out the types of individuals from whom we should seek answers. The brief will include matters such as age, ethnic background, qualifications and occupation. Research Now will review its database and then send out invitations to an online survey to people falling within the client brief.

Research Now provides clients with data files containing anonymous answers to survey questions or a report setting out and interpreting those answers. No personal data in respect of those individuals responding to a survey will be given to clients of Research Now.

Research Now will, from time to time, assist research organisations in other jurisdictions to survey people in the countries in which it operates.

In such circumstances your personal data are not transferred to third parties.

If a statutory condition applies allowing Research Now to process your personal data and you withdraw consent to process your personal data this will not necessarily mean that Research Now ceases to process your personal data as it may, for example, be under a statutory duty to continue to process your personal data for some purposes e.g. to keep copies of commercial transactions for a minimum of seven years.

Any personal information you send to us will be treated in the strictest confidence.

Research Now may continue to process your personal data after you have ceased to be a member of a research panel operated by Research Now, or a subsidiary or group company or if we have sent you any information you have requested.
