Our research survey websites, including this site ([www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/)), provide survey respondents with the opportunity to express opinions and attitudes about the most current issues. We conduct research that involves people from around the world, and we aggregate and anonymize such research (stripped of any personally identifiable information) before sending research results to our clients. In addition, certain survey findings might be published on our websites (in anonymous form) so that our respondents can be among the first to hear about the concerns and interests of people around the world.   
In order to compile our research studies, we may ask you to voluntarily submit personally identifiable information, which may include: 

  * your name and address, email address, telephone number and general contact details; 
  * images on film, photographs and telephone voice recordings; 
  * demographic information, such as your zip code, gender, country of origin or income level; 
  * your racial or ethnic origin; 
  * your political opinion(s) and/or political party with which you are affiliated; 
  * your religious or spiritual beliefs; 
  * whether or not you are a member of a labor union; 
  * your physical or mental health or condition; 
  * your sexual life; 
  * your hobbies and interests; and 
  * whether you have any type of criminal record, or have been arrested for any offense.

**Survey Results  
** Research Now conducts surveys on behalf of its clients. Research Now's clients include U.S.-based businesses, as well as research organizations based in other jurisdictions who wish to survey people in the U.S. or elsewhere.

Please note that information submitted on the [www.valuedopinions.com](http://www.valuedopinions.com/) site or otherwise sent to Research Now over the Internet may be transferred outside of the United States and outside of the European Economic Area (EEA), where data protection laws are not as strong as within these areas.

Research Now believes that it's especially important to protect children's privacy online and encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children to participate and monitor their Internet activity. Although Research Now is based in the United Kingdom, Research Now complies with the U.S. Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"). We do not seek to collect any personal information from children under 16 years of age. During the profile registration process, we collect birth date, and if an individual enters a birth date that indicates the individual is under 13, we block the registration and any personal information submitted by the individual is not saved in our database. From time to time, we may ask our adult survey respondents whether they have children residing with them who might have certain interests, such as favorite movies or music. In such event, we do not ask the child or parent to submit personally identifiable information about the child.   
If you would like to contact us about your information, any information about your child, or to find out how you can have your child's information removed from our database, please see the "5. Accessing the Personal Information You've Provided" section of this policy.
