**Council of Better Business Bureau**

Valpak.com also participates in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBB _OnLine_ Privacy Program, and complies with all the BBB _OnLine_ Â® Privacy standards. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/).

Questions regarding privacy issues should be directed to Valpak.com at valerie@valpak.com. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with any of our sites or to access those features that require registration.

**Collection and Use of Information**

The information gathered by Valpak.com falls into two categories: (1) information voluntarily supplied by visitors to our website through optional membership registration or other means such as registration for an online contest or sweepstakes and E-commerce transactions, and (2) tracking information gathered as visitors navigate through our site. Third party service providers on or linked to by our website, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may be gathering the same kinds of information.

**A Note about Children's Online Privacy:** Children are welcome to visit Valpak.com, but we have neither a children's area nor any information likely to be of special interest to children. Children should always get permission from their parents before sending any information about themselves (such as their names, email addresses, and phone numbers) over the Internet, to us or to anyone else. We won't knowingly allow anyone under 13 to register with Valpak.com, to otherwise provide personally-identifiable information, or to access those features that require registration.

**Membership Registration:** To make use of certain features on our websites (such as coupon e-mails) a visitor needs to register as a Valpak.com member and to provide certain information as part of the registration process. The membership registration form asks the visitor for his or her name, age range, address, zip code, e-mail address, general demographic information, and coupon category preferences. If the visitor does not wish to provide his or her name or address, or answer demographic questions, then these fields may be left blank.

The information you supply will help us to offer you more personalized features, and to tailor our site to your interests and make it more useful to you. The more you tell us about yourself, the more value we can offer you. Supplying such information is entirely voluntary. But if you don't supply the information we need, we may be unable to provide you with services we make available to other visitors to our sites. For example, we can't offer you personalized coupons or maps and driving directions to local businesses if you don't tell us where you live. And we can't send you email alerting you to a new service we're offering if you don't tell us what you're interested in and give us your email address. Similarly, we can't notify you that you've been lucky enough to win a prize in a promotional contest if we don't know how to contact you. Of course, even if you want to remain completely anonymous, you're still free to take advantage of the wealth of coupons and other content available on our site without registration.

The demographic information collected on Valpak.com is used internally for marketing and planning purposes. At times, Valpak.com may summarize the demographic information it collects for use in aggregate form for marketing and promotional purposes and share this aggregated information with third parties.

**E-mail Newsletter:**  
When you register as a member or participate in a special promotion or contest on Valpak.com you may be asked whether you would like to receive Valpak.com's e-mail newsletter. The newsletter notifies interested Valpak.com visitors of new coupons available on Valpak.com and occasionally provides notice of special events. Only visitors who explicitly "opt-in" will receive our e-mail newsletter. If you do not wish to receive Valpak.com's e-mail newsletter, simply "opt-out" by checking the appropriate box on the applicable Valpak.com form.

**Cookies**  
To help make our sites more responsive to the needs of our visitors, we invoke a standard feature of browser software, called a "cookie," to assign each visitor a unique, random number, a sort of user ID, that resides on your computer. The cookie doesn't actually identify the visitor, just the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily identify yourself (through registration, for example), we won't know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your computer. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply. A cookie can't read unrelated data off your hard drive. Our advertisers and third party service providers may also assign their own cookies to your browser, a process that we don't control.

We use cookies to help us tailor our site to your needs, to deliver a better, more personalized service. It is a cookie, for example, that allows us to deliver your personalized coupons, including driving directions and maps to direct you to local businesses. With cookies, we save you time because you don't need to re-enter information you've already entered, even if you have not visited Valpak.com for a while. And we use cookies to avoid showing you the same ad repeatedly during a single visit. In addition, we may use cookies to track the pages on our sites visited by our users. We can build a better site if we know which pages our users are visiting and how often. Of course, you can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do, you may not be able to take advantage of the personalized features enjoyed by other visitors to Valpak.com.

**IP Addresses:**  
Our web server automatically collects limited information about your computer's connection to the Internet, including your IP address, when you visit Valpak.com. (Your IP address is a number that lets computers attached to the Internet know where to send you data -- such as the web pages you view.) Your IP address does not identify you personally. We use this information to deliver our web pages to you upon request, to tailor our site to the interests of our users, and to measure traffic within our site.

**Information Sharing and Other Sites Beyond Valpak.com:**  
To make our site more valuable to our visitors, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers. Services such as Val-Pak Values, Complimentary Magazine Subscription, Val-Pak Savings Bar and Valpak.com Coupon Keeper, are made available through cooperative arrangements with providers that specialize in operating such services. And, of course, our sites include links to plenty of other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. Once you leave our servers (you can tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting. And when you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on Valpak-branded pages throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our provider partners via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.

**Advertisers:**  
When we present information to our advertisers - to help them understand our audience and confirm the value of advertising on our web site - it is usually in the form of aggregated statistics on traffic to various pages within our sites. From time to time, we may share information on visitors to our sites with those marketing products and services that we believe might be of interest to you. Please indicate on the appropriate registration form if you'd prefer we not share such information with them. If you so indicate on the appropriate registration form, we won't share information about you with anyone other than those identified when the information is collected. If you want to change your election (or to review, update, or delete the information you provided on registering), click to http://www.valpak.com/member/member_reg.jsp, enter the changes you want to make, and re-submit the form. Sometimes, we might also contact you directly about our own or our advertisers' products and services. If you'd prefer that we not do so, just indicate on your registration form that you prefer not to receive offers and information. And remember, you can always change your preferences.

All information gathered on our site is stored within a Val-Pak-controlled database accessible only to Val-Pak. However, as effective as any security measure implemented by Val-Pak may be, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet.

A final note: The Web is an evolving medium. If we need to change our privacy policy at some point in the future, we'll post the changes before they take effect. Our use of information gathered while the current policy is in effect will always be consistent with the current policy, even if we change that policy later.
