# Valspar Corporation - Legal Information

Valspar respects your right to privacy. This policy summarizes what personally identifiable information we may collect, and how we might use this information. This policy also describes other important topics relating to your privacy. 

  
Valspar only will collect personally identifiable information (such as name, title, company name, address, telephone number, or e-mail address) that you voluntarily provide through our web site or e-mail correspondence. We will collect general information (such as the type of browser you use, the files you request, and the domain name and country from which you request information) to improve our web site and better meet your needs. 

  
The information you supply will be used by Valspar (e.g., to respond to your inquiries, supply you with requested information on Valspar products and services or track orders you place with Valspar). In addition, Authorized third parties may be utilized by Valspar to collect, track and process such information. If you have submitted personal information to Valspar electronically and would like it removed or modified, please contact us at [privacy@valspar.com](mailto:privacy@valspar.com). We will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. It may be necessary, if required by law or if pertinent to judicial or governmental investigations, to release your personally identifiable information. Although Valspar has taken reasonable and prudent measures to protect its computer systems from unauthorized third parties, Valspar is not responsible for unauthorized use by such third parties of your personally identifiable information.

  
Valspar does not intend to collect personally identifiable information from children without permission of the child's parent or legal guardian. Children should submit personally identifiable information to Valspar only with the explicit permission of their parent or legal guardian. Where appropriate, Valspar will instruct children not to submit personal information. If your child has submitted personal information and you would like to request that such information be removed, you may do so as indicated above, and Valspar will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request.

Additionally, some of our Web pages may contain "cookies," which are data that may be sent to your Web browser and stored on your computer. This allows our server to "recognize" you when you visit our web site in the future. Most Web browsers can be configured to not accept cookies, or to notify you if a cookie is sent to you.
