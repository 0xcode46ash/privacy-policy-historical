  * We may share the information collected about you within the Valley Vet family of companies-which means we may disclose the information collected about you to our affiliates, subject to the terms of this privacy policy.
  * We may disclose the information collected about you to our third-party contractors and partners in connection with their performance of services or other activities in support of the Sites and our businesses, or their completing or confirming on our behalf a transaction or series of transactions that you conduct with us. For example, your credit or debit card number and expiration date, name, address, transaction amount, chargeback data, browsing and transaction history, computer location, and IP address and related data may be collected and provided to our merchant payment processor and its vendors, agents, suppliers, and contractors for the purpose of processing payment transactions and providing fraud detection, prevention, and scoring services.
  * Information about you that is collected by third-party ads, content, or technologies integrated with any of our Sites may be disclosed to such third parties.
  * We may disclose the results of aggregated data about you and other users of our Sites without restriction. In these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.
  * We may disclose to one or more third parties the information collected about you as part of a merger, acquisition, or other sale or transfer of any of the assets or business of Valley Vet, or any of our affiliates. Please note that the entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions may not comply with all of the terms of this privacy policy.
  * We may disclose information about you to the government or to other third parties to comply with the law, applicable regulations, governmental and quasi-governmental requests, court orders, and subpoenas or other legal process, such as in connection with suspected illegal activity associated with any of the Sites or our business. We reserve the right to release information collected through any of the Sites to law enforcement or other government officials, as we determine to be necessary or appropriate.
  * We may also disclose information about you to third parties if needed to enforce any of the terms of use or other agreements for one of our Sites, or any investigation of potential violations of those agreements; to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues; to protect against harm to any of the Sites; or to protect our rights, property, or safety, or the rights, property, or safety of our users or others (for example, to a consumer reporting agency for fraud protection).



### Security Measures for Information Collected Through Our Sites

To help protect the privacy of information collected through our Sites, we employ security measures that are intended to be consistent with industry best practices. In storing such information, we take commercially reasonable steps intended to protect such data against unauthorized access. But please be aware that our Sites are operated on software, hardware, and networks, and any component may experience breaches of security or other problems beyond our control that may compromise the security of information collected about you.

Please also be aware that despite our best intentions and the guidelines outlined in this privacy policy, no data transmission over the Internet or via a Wi-Fi network, or any encryption method, can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Thus, it may be possible for third parties not under Valley Vet's control to intercept or access your personal information transmitted through one of our Sites or via email. We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the security and integrity of all information you provide through our Sites, but due to the inherent nature of the Internet, we cannot guarantee that any such information will be absolutely safe from intrusion by others who do not have your authorization. Any such transmission of information about you to Valley Vet is at your own risk.

### How to Correct or Update Information About You Collected Through Our Sites

You may correct or update information collected about you through any of our Sites by contacting us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy, or, if available on a particular Site, by editing your information and preferences on your Account Information page on the Site. You may also unsubscribe from any email subscriptions by following the applicable "unsubscribe" link. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to update our files to reflect your request as promptly as possible.

We may retain original and updated information for reasons such as technical constraints, dispute resolution, compliance with laws, fraud prevention, troubleshooting, and enforcement of our terms of use and other agreements. Also, please note that we cannot update any information about you collected through any of the Sites that has already been disclosed (as permitted under this privacy policy) to a third party.

### How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals

Our Sites do not currently support "Do Not Track" preferences that may be available in your browser for letting websites know that you do not want them collecting certain kinds of information. Specifically, if you turn on the Do Not Track setting on your browser, our Sites are not currently capable of following whatever Do Not Track preferences you set. For more information about Do Not Track, visit donottrack.us.

### Transfer of Data from Outside the United States

If you use any of our Sites from outside the United States, information that we collect about you through the Site will be transferred to servers inside the United States and maintained indefinitely. By using the Sites, you consent to the transfer of data into the United States, and the processing of such data in the United States.

### Children

Our Sites are not designed to appeal to persons under 13 years of age (children). We do not knowingly collect or maintain personal information from children through our Sites. If we learn that any unauthorized personal information of a child has been collected, we will take appropriate steps to delete such information. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has provided any such personal information to us, you may contact us at the email or mailing address noted at the end of this privacy policy and request that we delete that information from our systems.

### Privacy Policies of any Linked Websites or Other Parties

This privacy policy only addresses Valley Vet's practices for the personal and other information that we may obtain about you through any of the Sites, or through your other communications with Valley Vet. Please be aware that when you use or access any of the Sites, you may be directed to other websites that are beyond our control, and Valley Vet is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, or the content of linked websites. We would expect that most, if not all, of these third parties will collect information about you when you use their offerings. But Valley Vet is not responsible for the privacy practices of third parties, regardless of whether they are linked or otherwise connected to our Sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy policy and terms of use whenever interacting with any third-party website, app, or other offering.

### Your California Privacy Rights

Sometimes we may share information collected about you with our affiliates and other third parties for their direct marketing purposes. Under California law, a California resident with whom we have an established relationship has the right to request certain information regarding the types of personal information that we have shared with third parties for these purposes, and the identities of those third parties-within the preceding calendar year, subject to certain exceptions. All requests for such information must be in writing and sent to us at service@valleyvet.com.

### Governing Law, Jurisdiction, and Dispute Resolution

The Sites (excluding any linked sites) are controlled by Valley Vet from our offices within the state of Kansas, in the United States of America. They can be accessed from all 50 states, as well as from other countries around the world. As each of these places has laws that may differ from those of Kansas, by accessing the Sites you and Valley Vet agree that the statutes and laws of the state of Kansas, without regard to the related conflicts of laws principles and the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods, will apply to all matters relating to the use of the Sites and the purchase of products and services available through the Sites. You and Valley Vet agree and submit to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of any court of competent jurisdiction within the state of Kansas with respect to such matters.

You also agree that any disputes related to your privacy, our use of your personal or other information collected through the Sites or otherwise, and the issues addressed in this privacy policy are governed by the dispute resolution provisions in the Terms of Use and other agreements applicable to the Sites-including the provisions for binding arbitration, waiver of the right to a jury trial, and waiver of the right to participate in a class, consolidated, or representative action. By using the Sites, you also agree to the limitation of liability provision in the Terms of Use and other agreements applicable to the Sites, including for any disputes or claims related to your privacy, our use of your personal or other information collected through the Sites or otherwise, and the issues addressed in this privacy policy.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time, by updating the privacy policy posted on the applicable Sites. Such changes to this privacy policy will be effective immediately upon posting them. We include the effective date of our privacy policy at the top of the statement. We encourage you to check our Site frequently to see the current privacy policy in effect, and any changes that may have been made to it. If we make material changes to the privacy policy, we will post the revised privacy policy and the revised effective date on the Sites. Your continued use of the Sites after a change has been posted constitutes your acceptance of the change. If you disagree with any changes to this privacy policy, your sole remedy is to discontinue your use of the Sites.
