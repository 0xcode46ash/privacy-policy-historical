# ValueClick - About Us - Privacy Statement

  
**VALUECLICK INC'S PRIVACY STATEMENT**  
Internet consumer privacy is of paramount importance to ValueClick, our advertisers, and the Web publishers in our network. The following statement outlines ValueClick's policies and principles regarding online privacy. ValueClick, Inc. is committed to protecting the privacy of consumers, publishers, and advertisers, and to do our part to maintain the integrity of the Internet. 

Because of the changing nature of consumer needs and our business itself, ValueClick, Inc. reserves the right to modify this policy statement at any time without notice. As such, and since we want to always make certain that our privacy policy is clearly understood, 

_we recommend that you review this Privacy Statement periodically to note any changes that may have occurred_. Please forward any comments you may have regarding this policy to us at [privacy@valueclick.com](mailto:privacy@valueclick.com). _**Internet Consumer Data Collected by ValueClick, Inc's Standard Delivery System.**_

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**  
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements (running through our network of websites), ValueClick, Inc. does not collect any personally identifiable information regarding the consumer who clicked on the ad (e.g. name, address, social security number, e-mail address).   
**  
Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII)**  
When an Internet consumer clicks on one of ValueClick, Inc.'s served advertisements (running through our network of websites), ValueClick, Inc. does collect what the industry terms as "ad delivery and reporting data" (Type of Browser, Operating System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement). This type of information is defined by the Network Advertising Initiative (see Network Advertising Initiative section below) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) "ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes.

ValueClick, Inc. retains all ad delivery and reporting data indefinitely, for accounting and auditing purposes.. 

In addition ValueClick, Inc. does not collect any specific non-personally identifiable information (e.g. age, gender, interests, income-range) that could potentially be linked with other data to identify individual Internet consumers for the purpose of profiling.

**"Cookies"**   
When an Internet consumer views a ValueClick, Inc. served banner for the first time, a "cookie" is placed within their computer. A "cookie" is a unique tag that is issued to the Internet customer and is used to identify individual computers. The purpose of the cookie is to allow the ad serving company to deliver advertisements that have a greater degree of relevance to the consumer, even though that consumer is, in essence, anonymous to the ad serving company. Consumers who wish to remove this cookie and disable their web browser from receiving further cookies can do so by following the opt-out procedures found in the section immediately below. _**Consumer Choice Concerning Data Collection**_

**Ad management and Reporting Data - Use of Cookies - Remove and Disable option**  
When a consumer views an ad served by ValueClick, Inc., they are assigned a unique number, known as a cookie, which is recorded and stored on their computer in their web browser's cookie file. Cookies do not harm Internet consumer's computers. 

While cookies are not essential to ValueClick, Inc.'s continued success, they do help us to reach several of our key goals, such as providing Internet users with a more fulfilling, results oriented experience on the web, reducing the repetition of advertising, and increasing the amount of relevant material viewed by Internet consumers.

Internet consumers have the option of disabling cookies within their web browser software, which means that they will no longer receive cookies without their approval. Internet consumers can also delete any cookies that currently reside on their computer. Internet consumers should refer to their respective browser's user manual for instruction on performing this action. It is important to note that disabling the cookie option in your web browser will block your computer from receiving cookies from all websites using this technology. _**Client Data (i.e. Web Publishers and Advertisers)**_

**Non-Personally Identifiable Client Data.**  
ValueClick, Inc. does not collect non-personally identifiable information from our clients. Non-personally identifiable information is also known as "demographic" data and includes information such as age, gender, and income range.

Any third-party vendor so used, will be required to enter into a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement with ValueClick, Inc. in accordance with the policies stated here.

 _ **Client Choice Concerning Data Collection**_

**Personally Identifiable Client Data - Opt-Out**  
Because ValueClick, Inc. is a strong proponent of online privacy we are committed to making sure that clear notice and choice is provided to all clients before any personally identifiable data are used for any purposes other than for what was originally intended. 

When a client joins ValueClick, Inc.'s network and registers for ValueClick, Inc.'s services, personally identifiable information is required as a part of doing business.
