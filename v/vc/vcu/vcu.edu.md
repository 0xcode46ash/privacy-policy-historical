The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices of official Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) web pages (defined as Institutional Web Pages in the [**VCU Web Publishing Guidelines**](https://web.archive.org/web/20060615031602id_/http%3A//www.vcu.edu/guidelines/index.html)) and is in accordance with the following statement.

The VCU Website does not require that any personal information be supplied in order to download publicly available files or reports. 

In addition to the VCU Web Privacy Statement, the University encourages its College, Schools, Departments, Centers, Institutes and other units contributing to its official web pages to provide specific notices about the collection and use of any personal information associated with those pages.
