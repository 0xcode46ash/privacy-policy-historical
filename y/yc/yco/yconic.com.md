**YCONIC**

**PRIVACY POLICY**

yconic Inc. (“ **we** ”/” **us** ”) is committed to protecting your privacy.  We make the website, http://www.yconic.com/ (the “ **Website** ”) available together with our services as further described in our Terms of Use (the “ **Services** ”).  This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, store, use and distribute information about our users through the Website and Services. 

**Consent: By using the Website or our Services you consent to the use of your Personal Information as described in this Privacy Policy**.  Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, your Personal Information will not be used for any other purpose without your consent. We will not actively collect Personal Information for the purpose of sale or marketing in a way that specifically identifies the individual.  In other words, we don’t sell customer lists.  You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time.  However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using the Website and/or the Services.

**Collection of Information:  **We aim to collect, use and disclose only such information as is required to enable us to manage your account, to provide the Services, to maintain our customer/visitor lists, to respond to your inquiries or provide feedback, for identification and authentication purposes and for service improvement. We will maintain the confidentiality of any contact information you provide to us on signing up for our Services or contacting us with questions or for further information and we will use it only for the purposes for which we have collected it (subject to the exclusions and disclosures we have listed below), unless you agree that we may disclose it to other third parties.

Two types of information may be collected through the Website and our Services: Personal Information and Non-Personal Information.  This Privacy Policy does not extend to the collection, use or disclosure of the following information which is currently not limited by applicable privacy laws: (a) information that is publicly available, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers and electronic address when listed in a directory or made available through directory assistance; or (b) Non-Personal Information (as defined further below).

" ** _Personal Information_** " is personally identifiable information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information, birth date and gender.  At the time of collection, we will clearly identify the information being collected and the purposes for which it will be used.  It is always your choice whether or not to provide Personal Information but if you choose not to provide certain requested Personal Information, in some instances you may not be able to register to use the Website or be able to access and use the Website at all.  In other instances, your choice not to provide certain other Personal Information may mean that you will not be able to use certain features of the Website.  We may collect Personal Information in respect of the Website through registration processes; communications with you; information downloads; service use; user support; and surveys.

" ** _Non-Personal Information_** " is information of an anonymous nature, such as an Internet Protocol Address (IP Address), the domain used to access the Website, and the type and version of browser or operating system being used by visitors to the website.  Aggregate information, such as demographic statistics of our users (e.g. average age or geographical allocation of our users), number of visitors, what pages users access or visit, and average time spent on the Website is not considered Personal Information.  Similarly, business contact information such as the name, title, business address, or telephone number of a business or professional person or an employee of an organization is not considered Personal Information.

Although the use of certain Non-Personal Information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the Website.  Such Non-Personal Information is collected or derived by us in the course of operating this Website.  For example, our web servers may automatically collect Non-Personal Information that is provided through your browser or stored in a cookie when you choose to visit the Website.

**Use of Information:  **We collect information for the following purposes:

  * **Registration and Profile Information:**   In order to register for our Services you must provide certain Personal Information to us such as your full name, address and email address.  You also have the option to log in using your account credentials with any social media accounts indicated by us from time to time.  If you log in using a third-party social media account, the information we will have access to in respect of such account will depend on the privacy policy of the applicable third-party social media platform provider as well as your privacy preferences in respect of such social media account.  You may also provide us with additional profile information including your age, gender, academic information, interests, background and profile photo.  We will use this information to identify awards, scholarships, bursaries and other funding opportunities that may be of interest to you. 
  * **Social Sharing:**  If you choose to use any of the social sharing features supported by the Website to share information with your network (i.e. Tweet this award), such information will be processed according to the privacy practices of the applicable third-party social media provider as well as your privacy settings in respect of your account with such third-party social media provider.

  * **Messages:**  Users have the ability to send messages to each other through the Services.  If you send a message to another user, they will be able to see your username, profile photo and the content of your message.  If you receive a message from another user, we will send you an email to let you know that you have received a new message.
  * **Surveys:**  If you choose to complete a survey, we will use your survey responses and biographical information from your profile such as your age, gender and educational background to create anonymous aggregate statistics.  See further, ‘Statistics’ below.

  * **System Logs & Cookies:** Cookies are used by us to track content usage and traffic on the Website.  A cookie is a feature of your web browser that consists of a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server.  The Website uses cookies to help it compile aggregate statistics about usage of this Website, such as how many users visit the Website, how long users spend viewing the Website, and what pages are viewed most often.  This information is used to improve the content of the Website.  You can set your browser to notify you when you are sent a cookie.  This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it.  If you disable cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of all the features of the Website.  We do not link any of the information we use in cookies to any personally identifiable information submitted by you when you are on the Website.

Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your computer by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers.  For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).
