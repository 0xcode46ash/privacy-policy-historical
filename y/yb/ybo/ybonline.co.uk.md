We may work with third parties to research certain usage and activities on our website on our behalf. No personal information about you is shared except to the extent it is required to be used by a third party or parties for providing such research, and in the course of conducting this research we, and/or these third parties may place a unique "cookie" on your browser.

A cookie is a small file which is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard disc and helps us understand and track your use of the site and where it can improve the information and services provided.

There are two different types of cookies:

Session cookies - these are temporary and are erased when you close your internet browser.

Persistent cookies - these remain on your hard drive until you erase them or they expire at a pre-set deletion date.

We use cookies to gather information on IP addresses, to analyse trends, administer the site, track users' movements on the site and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.

We may also use web beacons or spotlight tags. These are transparent image files used to understand how users interact with the pages and content on the pages of our web site. We do not use web beacons to collect information about specific users.

IP addresses are not linked to other personally identifiable information, with the exception of that stored in certain cookies used for analysis during the application process for products on this website. Any information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
