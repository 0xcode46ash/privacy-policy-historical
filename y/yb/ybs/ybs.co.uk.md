# YBS Your Society - Information about the privacy & security of your personal data

## Privacy Policy

The privacy and security of your personal information is very important to us. We will not disclose it to anyone except with your consent or if the law, public duty or our legitimate interests require us to do so.

We comply with the [Banking Code](http://www.bcsb.co.uk/).

Any queries about the privacy of this site should be sent to [Service Quality Dept](https://online.ybs.co.uk/public/contact_us/your_say.do), Yorkshire Building Society, Yorkshire House, Yorkshire Drive, Bradford, BD5 8LJ.

Our general policies

**Email**

Please remember that ordinary e-mail is not secure. In addition, personal information transferred over the Internet may pass through servers in countries without data protection laws. Because of this, we will not use unencrypted e-mails to communicate with you about your account - we only use e-mail to let you know that confidential information is ready for you to collect by other secure methods.

For your own protection, please do not include confidential or other personal information in any unprotected e-mails you send to us.

**Using your information for marketing**

You have the right to object to the use of your information for marketing. All our application forms include a box you can tick if you do not wish to receive marketing information.

Unless you do so, we will assume that you consent to us sending you information about additional products and services from us, our subsidiaries or other organisations which may be of benefit to you unless you tell us that you no longer wish to receive this. 

We will remind you of your right to opt out of receiving marketing information every three years. Although you may be informed about other companies products, we do the marketing and do not pass your details to any other company for their own use.

If you do not wish to receive unsolicited mail from other organisations, you can register your details with one of the Marketing Preference Services run by the [Direct Marketing Association](http://www.dma.org.uk/).

All communications with us may be monitored/recorded to improve the quality of our service, staff trainingÂ and for your protection and security.
