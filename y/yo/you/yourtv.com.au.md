## Introduction 

HWW Pty Limited has adopted the following management guidelines to assure our commitment to your privacy. These guidelines disclose the information gathering and dissemination policies for the HWW network of websites ("HWW Websites"). The guidelines have been developed with particular attention to the ten National Privacy Principles that the December 2001 private sector amendments to the Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988 contain. 

We recognise that internet technologies are rapidly evolving, and that underlying business models are still not fully established. Accordingly, these guidelines are subject to change. Any such changes will be made to this page.
