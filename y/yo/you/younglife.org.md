# Young Life Privacy Policy and Conditions of Use

### Privacy Policy for Website Access

**How Information is Collected**

On some Young Life web pages or websites (including all Young Life local, regional, divisional, international and camp websites and the Young Life Staff Resource Site, which are hereinafter referred to as “the Young Life network”), you may be asked to provide certain personal information for ministry-related purposes or to make ministry contributions. We do not collect personal information without your knowledge; however, we do allow you to provide personal information that will help us serve your request (for instance, you can give feedback or make donations on the Young Life network). We will only ask for the information that will help us facilitate your request. When you provide any such information, you are acknowledging your consent to our use of such information to better serve you and others visiting the Young Life network.

**How Information is Used**

Young Life uses information you provide to better serve your requests. We do not sell, lease or rent your confidential information to others. However, we may need to provide personal information as may be required by law, regulation, court order, subpoena, search warrant, in the course of a legal proceeding or in response to a law enforcement agency request, to enforce our terms of use or to protect the safety and security of our visitors and our sites.

**Security**

To safeguard and secure the information we collect online, Young Life has applied appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to prevent unauthorized access and maintain data accuracy. Internet encryption software, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol, is utilized to protect sensitive data transmissions with banking or credit card information. The padlock icon in the bottom of your browser’s window or a blue line around the window signifies that a site is secure. Sometimes password protection is used to protect your privacy and security.

**Third-Party Disclosure**

Young Life does not disclose any personal information we collect from our websites to third parties. We do use this aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, to give us demographic information about the entire Young Life network audience in order to improve our service through our entire series of information and products. 

**Links to Other Sites**

The Young Life network may, from time to time, provide links to other sites not owned or controlled by Young Life. In some cases, Young Life has contracted other vendors to manage a specific function such as Young Life's online store or donor giving. No assumption should be made and no representation should be inferred that Young Life is connected with, operates or controls these websites. Users who agree to link to these sites are alerted that they are leaving the Young Life network before they are linked to the other site. The privacy and data collection practices on linked websites are entirely separate from the Young Life network and are not covered by this privacy policy. 

**Site Access  — Commercial Use**

Your personal use and access of this site does not allow you to download or modify it, or any portion of it, except with the express written consent of Young Life. You may not commercially use, or otherwise exploit for any commercial purpose, the contents of the Young Life network, including images, content or photographs or any derivative use of the Young Life network. You may not download or copy any of the information on this network for the benefit of another; or use any data mining, robots or similar data-gathering and extraction tools. You may not reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell, visit or otherwise exploit any portion of this network for any commercial purpose without the express written consent of Young Life.

You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademarks or logos, photographs, content or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout or form) of Young Life network without express written consent. You may not use meta tags or any other “hidden text” utilizing any names or trademarks or logos contained in the Young Life network without the express written consent of Young Life. You may not create a hyperlink to the home page or any internal page of the Young Life network without the express written permission of Young Life. [See Permissions](https://web.archive.org/Pages/Legal/PermissionToUseYoungLifeBrandIdentityElements.aspx). 

**Site Modification**

Young Life reserves the right to make changes to the Young Life network, policies and Conditions of Use at any time. If any of these policies or conditions shall be deemed invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, that condition shall be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining condition.

**School Non-Affiliation Statement**

The use of a school name within the Young Life network that references a local Young Life or WyldLife group is not intended to imply any affiliation between Young Life and the school or school district (public or private). Young Life and WyldLife groups are often formed according to the school or schools where kids attend. The use of any school name on the Young Life network is only intended to assist kids, parents and adults to easily locate communities where Young Life ministry exists. If you are a school administrator, you can [find out more](https://web.archive.org/GetInvolved/Pages/default.aspx) about Young Life.

### [](https://web.archive.org/Pages/Legal/PrivacyPolicy.aspx)Children's Privacy Policy

The Young Life network of websites is informational sites for parents and children about Young Life. Our pages are designed primarily to provide information to children, ages 11 and up, who participate in or are interested in the various Young Life activities. It is our intention to provide a safe, fun environment where children may explore Young Life, their own Young Life club and other Young Life activities.

We care about your privacy and we take great care to safeguard your personal information. We do not require our users to supply us with any personal information. We never condition a child's participation in an activity on the child's disclosing more personal information than is reasonably necessary to participate in that activity. All personally identifiable information we do collect can only be accessed by authorized Young Life staff, and only those people who require access may see this information. We preserve the confidentiality, security and integrity of that information. Upon your request, we will provide you with information as to all of the personal information we have regarding you and your child and we will not share this information with any third parties. As we continue to offer our visitors new and different types of content and services, we may modify our practices periodically. However, we will treat all personal information we collect in accordance with the privacy notice in effect at the time the information is collected. You will be notified and your consent will be requested should there be any material changes in the collection, use or disclosure practices to which you have previously agreed.

The Young Life network is designed to comply with the requirement of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) guidelines for websites gathering identifiable information from children.

**Kids**

**Be sure to ask your parents for permission before you send any information about yourself (your name, address, email address, other information) to us or anyone else over the Internet.**

Personal information may be requested when using the following features:

  * **Email Comments** Some websites within the Young Life network have a page on which children may send an email with comments to Young Life. Information gathered from these email comments are only for the internal use of Young Life. If sample comments are posted on the website, then no identifiable information is ever included.
  * **Cookies** The Young Life network uses a software technology called "cookies" that helps us track non-personal aggregate data about who visits our site. This helps us keep track of the number of visitors to our site and allows us to gauge the areas that are of the most interest to our members. The cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information and are not linked to any personally identifiable information. 



**Third-Party Disclosure**

Young Life does not disclose any personal information we collect from our websites to third parties. We do use this aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, to give us demographic information about the entire Young Life network audience in order to improve our service through our entire series of information and products.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Young Life network may, from time to time, provide links to other sites not owned or controlled by Young Life. In some cases Young Life has contracted other vendors to manage a specific function such as Young Life's online store or donor giving. No assumption should be made and no representation should be inferred that Young Life is connected with, operates or controls these websites. Users who agree to link to these sites are alerted that they are leaving the Young Life network before they are linked to the other site. The privacy and data collection practices on linked websites are entirely separate from the Young Life network and are not covered by this privacy policy.

Kids are encouraged to ask their parents' permission before linking to these sites or giving out any information. Parents are encouraged to become actively involved in the sites their kids visit, and to monitor their time spent there and to check their privacy policies as well.
