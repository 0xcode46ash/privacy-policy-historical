H33T, one of the Internet's most popular torrent sites, disappeared offline in September following a complaint from Universal Music over the unauthorized distribution of Robin Thickeâ€™s album Blurred Lines. After a brief return the site suffered a total blackout and until now has been presumed dead. Today, however, H33T is back online with its owner telling TorrentFreak that just two links caused the site's worldwide takedown.
