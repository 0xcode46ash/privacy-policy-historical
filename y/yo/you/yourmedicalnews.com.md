Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to the Web Site owned and/or operated by, and upon which Yourmedicalnews has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, transfers You to this Privacy Policy. It is not applicable to any web sites which are not owned and operated by Yourmedicalnews. While on our Web Site, You may encounter links to these web sites or online material. If You “click” on a link to such a third party, the “click” takes You off our Web Site and transfers You to a third party’s web site, which is beyond Yourmedicalnews’ control. These other web sites may set their own cookies, collect data, and/or have their own privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at the Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site. We encourage You to review the privacy policy of any other web site You visit.

In addition, please note that this Privacy Policy does not apply to any information You may disclose publicly in any chat rooms, message boards, or similar web pages. You should keep in mind that whenever You publicly disclose information about yourself online – for example, via message boards or chat rooms – that information could be collected and used by people that You do not know. In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses (as defined below) along with the message poster’s name and message. Yourmedicalnews bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the Web Site.

However, there may be times when we ask You to provide us with certain PII, such as when You choose to register with our Web Site and/or for newsletters or choose to participate in an online contest, sweepstakes, survey or voting procedure. we may also ask You to provide us with demographic information or information regarding Your interests, hobbies or similar information.
