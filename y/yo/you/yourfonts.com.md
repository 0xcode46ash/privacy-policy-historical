# YourFonts - Privacy Policy

### Privacy Policy

Updated: Thursday, September 3, 2009 (previous version can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/privacy20090106.html))

#### Philosophy

We are only interested in collecting and retaining the information that is necessary to effectively run our business. We respect your right to keep your personal information private.

#### Uploaded Files and Generated Fonts

All uploaded files and generated fonts are stored on our servers for a maximum of 15 days. We never share personal information. Occasionally an attempt to generate a font fails, and then we might look into such problem to see if we can improve our font generation algorithm. So that's the only possible reason for us to use uploaded data, and even then it's only used to look into issues with our font generator. Although it makes us happy to see so many people pleased with their own custom fonts, we are by no means interested in the individual fonts generated through our service. We prefer to put time and effort in improving existing and developing new software and services.

#### E-mail

We will not sell your e-mail address, nor do we provide it to advertisers or mass marketers. In other words, you will never receive junk mail based on information you submit directly to us. You may remove yourself from our electronic mailing lists by following the directions included in each e-mail or at [this page](https://web.archive.org/newsletter.html).

#### Outside Links

This website provides links to other Internet sites. We are not responsible for the content, products, services or privacy policies of these sites.

#### Legal Disclaimer

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

#### Assent

By using this website, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use the website. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes.

“Yourfonts est une très belle surprise. J'avais besoin de créer ma typo (police) pour la bande dessinée que je suis en train de faire et le résultat est vraiment super. N'hésitez pas cependant à juste "voir" en un premier temps votre police et rectifier les erreurs qu'elle pourrait avoir. Par exemple, certaines lettres trop grosses, pas au même niveau ou simplement traits différents les...” [more]
