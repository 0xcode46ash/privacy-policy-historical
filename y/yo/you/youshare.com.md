**Privacy Policy**

We respect your privacy, and we want you to feel comfortable using the EpicFail web site.   
Therefore, we are providing you with this privacy policy so you can better understand how we   
collect information about you, what we do with your information, and who, other than EpicFail.com  
may also receive your information.

Combo Ventures, LLC d/b/a EpicFail.com does collect certain personally identifiable information  
that may be used to provide you with customized services, content, networking opportunities,   
industry information and/or advertisements. Personally identifiable information is collected   
when you register to receive certain EpicFail.com services, products or offers. EpicFail.com   
may also request personally identifiable information when the user elects to participate in   
other EpicFail.com affiliated or sponsored programs, including, but not limited to,   
sweepstakes, contests, and/or other such promotions.  
EpicFail.com may share the collected personally identifiable information with a sponsor or other   
third party that may be interested in serving you. EpicFail.com will request and verify your   
consent before any personally identifiable information is provided to sponsors or third parties.   
You may also inform EpicFail.com at any time not to share your personally identifiable   
information with third parties by sending an e-mail message to epicfail.com@gmail.com and   
requesting that your personally identifiable information not be released to third parties.

EpicFail.com may use your personally identifiable information to provide you with any of our   
present and future services. We may also use this information to notify you or contact you with   
regard to any problem with, or the expiration of such services. For this reason, EpicFail.com   
may find it necessary to disclose your personally identifiable information to one or more   
EpicFail.com agents and/or contractors and their subcontractors, but such agents, contractors,   
and subcontractors will be required to agree to use any personally identifiable information   
obtained from EpicFail.com for only such purposes.  
Personally identifiable information also may be disclosed to the proper authorities in special   
situations where EpicFail.com has reason to believe that doing so is necessary to identify, contact   
or bring legal action against anyone damaging, injuring, or interfering (intentionally or   
unintentionally) with EpicFail.com's rights, property, users, or anyone else who may be harmed by   
such activities. EpicFail.com may reveal personally identifiable information when we have   
been informed by law enforcement authorities or have established a good faith belief that the   
law requires EpicFail.com to do so.

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy at any time by posting revisions on the   
EpicFail.com web site. This privacy policy is not intended to, and does not create any contractual   
or other legal rights in or on behalf of any party.
