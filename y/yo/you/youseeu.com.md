This Privacy Policy supplements the Youseeu [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.php), and sets forth the terms and conditions relating to users’ privacy as defined below. Capitalized terms in this policy shall have the meaning attributed to them in the Youseeu [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.php).

### What This Privacy Policy Covers

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * Youseeu does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:   

    * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Youseeu under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Youseeu communicate with you about offers from Youseeu and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
    * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
    * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Youseeu's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
    * We transfer information about you if Youseeu is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Youseeu will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 
  * Youseeu displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.   

    * Youseeu does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 
    * Youseeu advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies) 
  * Youseeu works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you've requested please contact us at [info@youseeu.com](mailto:info@kaltura.com).
