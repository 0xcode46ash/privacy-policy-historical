Some of the performance cookies are analytics cookies using third party web analytics software, which allow us to understand more about how our Site is used. For example, like many companies, we use Google Analytics, which may use performance cookies. We use Google Analytics to obtain web trend information about user interaction with this Site. We use this information for system administration purposes and to identify problems and improve service.

They may also be used to provide services you have asked for, such as watching a video or commenting on a blog.

These cookies are known as “functionality cookies” and they help to improve a user’s experience of a website by providing a more personalized service. **By using this Site you agree we may place these types of cookies on your device.**
  4. Targeting or advertising cookies: These cookies are used to deliver advertising materials relevant to you and your interests.

They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organizations such as advertisers.
