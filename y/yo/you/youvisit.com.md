**Collection and Use of Personal Information.**

You are not required to provide us with personal information to use the Platforms.  You do, however, have the option to provide us with certain limited personal information including your name, the name of your school or college, your email address, among other information. We may also collect information about you through a number of other methods including those outlined below. This Privacy Policy applies to all personal information that we collect and maintain about the users of our Platforms.

**Log Files**

We use log files on certain of the Platforms to collect and store certain information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. These server logs may include internet protocol addresses, browser type, internet service provider, referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, for various purposes including to analyze trends, to administer the Platforms, to track users’ navigation around the Platforms and to gather demographic information. We link this automatically collected data to personal information you provide to us. 

**Cookies  **

We use cookies on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including improving the quality of our products and services and storing user preferences. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We link the information we store in cookies to personal information you provide to us.

We may also use third-party tracking services that use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about users of certain of the Platforms in the aggregate, including information with respect to usage of the Platforms. ****

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**

We use clear gifs on certain of the Platforms for various purposes, including to help us better manage content across our Platforms by indicating to us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the browsing of users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to personal information you provide to us. 

**How We Use Your Personal Information.**

We use your personal information for various purposes, including to provide you with products or services that you have requested, to respond to questions or communications from you, and to contact you when necessary. In addition, we may send to you an e-mail offering products or services which we think you may be interested in or to ask you to participate in a survey.

**How We Share Your Personal Information.**

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Policy we will only share the personal information you provide us (a) for the purpose(s) you provided it; (b) with your consent; (c) as may be required by law or as we think necessary to protect our company or others from injury (e.g., in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request or when we believe that someone is causing (or about to cause) injury to or interference with the rights or property of another); and (d) with other persons and entities including service providers and affiliated entities with whom we contract to carry out internal site operations or other business activities; and (e) with colleges, universities and other entities with whom YouVisit has a customer or other contractual relationship. 

If we do share personal information with colleges, universities or other entities, to the extent practical, we require that they protect such information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. We cannot, however, guarantee how these colleges, universities or other entities will use your personal information.

**Personal Information Collected Under Previous Versions of This Privacy Policy.**

Personal information collected on the Platforms will be governed by the version of the Privacy Policy in effect at the time the information was collected. We will not retroactively make material changes to the way we use personal information collected under previous versions of this Privacy Policy without obtaining your consent.  
** **  
**Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information.**

We may use the non-personally identifiable information we collect to analyze how the Platforms are used for various purposes, including to improve the design and content of the Platforms and to assist us in personalizing the user experience. We may share non-personally identifiable information with others, including affiliated and non-affiliated companies.

**Receipt of Communications; Opt-Out.**

If you would prefer not to receive marketing or promotional e-mails from us that may relate, for example, to new product or services or offerings, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by writing to us at privacy@youvisit.com or by using the opt-out mechanism that is contained in an email.

Following your opt-out, please be aware that we, or our affiliates or clients, may continue to contact you by email or postal mail or other means for administrative or informational purposes, including, but not limited to, follow-up messages regarding the administration of your account, any products, services, features or functions you have affirmatively enrolled in or registered to use, goods, services or products you have ordered or other transactions you have undertaken across the Platforms. 

**Blogs, Discussion Groups and Other Community Tools.**

We may, from time to time, make blogs, discussion groups and other community tools available to you on certain sections of the Platforms. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information for other users to view and for us to use as we deem appropriate. You should carefully consider whether to disclose your personal information in these areas, since anyone may access your publicly posted information.

**Third Party Advertisers**

We may, in the future, engage an advertising partner to serve advertisements across the Platforms.  If we elect to do so, we may share information including usage information about users with such party for the purpose of targeting the advertisements across the Platforms. 

A third party ad server may use cookies and clear gifs on the Platforms, which would allow them to recognize a user's cookie when a user visits certain of the Platforms. The information that a third party ad server would collect and share through this technology would not be personally identifiable.

**Links to Other Sites**

The Platforms contain links to other sites and platforms that are not owned or controlled by YouVisit LLC, including those of our clients and third party service providers.  Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy policies of such other sites and platforms. 

We encourage you to take note when you leave one of our Platforms, and to read the privacy policies of each and every site that collects personal information. 

**Security of Information**

The security of your personal information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is entirely secure, however.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Transfer of Business Assets.**

In the event that YouVisit LLC enters into a business transition such as a merger, acquisition, or a sale of some or all of its assets, your personal information will likely be among the assets that are transferred. ****

**International Users.**

If you are visiting one of our Platforms from a location outside of the United States, your connection will be through and to servers located in the United States and all information you provide will be processed and maintained on our servers and internal systems located within the United States. IN ADDITION, IF YOU ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU SHOULD NOTE THAT YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO THE UNITED STATES, THE LAWS OF WHICH MAY BE DEEMED BY OTHER COUNTRIES TO HAVE INADEQUATE DATA PROTECTION (see, for example, European Union Directive 95/46/EC of 24 October 1995, a copy of which can be found [here](http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/fsj/privacy/docs/95-46-ce/dir1995-46_part1_en.pdf)). Users located in countries outside of the United States who submit personal information do thereby consent to the general use of such information as provided in this Privacy Policy and to the transfer of that information to and/or storage of the information in the United States. ****

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to modify this Privacy Policy at any time so please review it frequently. ****
