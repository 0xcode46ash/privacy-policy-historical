YourStreet recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you and is committed to protecting your privacy. The privacy policy described below applies to the site and services offered by YourStreet. BY USING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY. 

**This policy was last modified on October 4, 2007.**

YourStreet provides you with summaries of local news articles and blog posts that are plotted on an interactive map. You can also comment on articles, create a user profile, and participate in local conversations. 

**What information is collected by YourStreet:**  
You may use YourStreet's services anonymously and we will not collect any information about you. 

YourStreet does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, YourStreet does collect information from you when you register on our website. Registration is necessary to contribute some content to the YourStreet website. When you register we ask you for your e-mail address and request you to specify a username, password, and your zip code. We also ask you to indicate your location on a map, which is optional. 

In the "Profile" section of our website, you can view and modify information you submitted during the registration process. You can also add information, such as your first and last name, a picture to represent yourself, your biography, your interests, your favorite neighborhood hangout, and your website. In this section, you may also specify whether your first and last name and e-mail address are public or private with respect to other users. 

YourStreet notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, IP address, and IP location with each query. If you make a comment on an article or conversation without registering for the website, YourStreet will ask you to provide a username and will display your IP location on the screen for other users to see. 

YourStreet uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other websites you visit. 

**How you can access and update your information:**  
Your profile information is always available when you log in to the website using your username and password. You are free to change or delete any or all of your profile information at any time. However, if you delete your profile information, you may not be able to access your account. 

**How the information collected is used:**  
YourStreet will not share, sell, or rent your personal information to third parties. 

YourStreet uses your personal information only for the operation and maintenance of the service provided by this site. For example, your username will be used to identify you when you contribute content to the site, such as, in a discussion forum. 

YourStreet will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this privacy statement without your prior consent. 

**How your information is protected:**  
YourStreet strictly protects the security of the personal information you provide. Personal information we collect is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access, and we carefully protect this information from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

**When your information may be disclosed:**  
YourStreet may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process served on YourStreet or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of YourStreet; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety of users of YourStreet, its websites, or the public. 

**Updates to this privacy policy:**  
We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates. 

**Sale of assets:**  
In the unlikely event that YourStreet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
