# Privacy Policy

#### YOURSTREET WEBSITE  
PRIVACY POLICY

YourStreet recognizes that your privacy and the protection of your personal information is important to you and is committed to protecting your privacy. The privacy policy described below applies to the site and services offered by YourStreet. BY USING THIS SITE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS POLICY. 

YourStreet provides you with summaries of local news articles and blog posts that are plotted on an interactive map. You can also comment on articles, create a user profile, and participate in local conversations. 

You may use YourStreet's services anonymously and we will not collect any information about you. 

YourStreet does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, YourStreet does collect information from you when you register on our website. Registration is necessary to contribute some content to the YourStreet website. When you register we ask you for your e-mail address and request you to specify a username, password, and your zip code. We also ask you to indicate your location on a map, which is optional. 

In the 'Profile' section of our website, you can view and modify information you submitted during the registration process. You can also add information, such as your first and last name, a picture to represent yourself, your biography, your interests, your favorite neighborhood hangout, and your website. In this section, you may also specify whether your first and last name and e-mail address are public or private with respect to other users. 

One of the purposes of the YourStreet services is for users to share information (including location-related information) with other users. THEREFORE, YOU SHOULD ASSUME THAT ANY INFORMATION (INCLUDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU MAY CHOOSE TO PROVIDE IN YOUR PROFILE OR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE YOURSTREET SERVICES, BUT EXCLUDING ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU HAVE SPECIFIC AS 'PRIVATE') WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER USERS OF THE SERVICES. PLEASE BE AWARE OF THIS FACT AND ONLY PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT YOU ARE COMFORTABLE SHARING WITH OTHERS IN THIS WAY AND BE ESPECIALLY CIRCUMSPECT WHEN PROVIDING PERSONAL INFORMATION SUCH AS YOUR REAL NAME, ADDRESS, GENDER, OR AGE. 

Your profile information is always available when you log in to the website using your username and password. You are free to change or delete any or all of your profile information at any time. However, if you delete your profile information, you may not be able to access your account. 

YourStreet notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, IP address, and IP location with each query. If you make a comment on an article or conversation without registering for the website, YourStreet will ask you to provide a username and will display your IP location on the screen for other users to see. 

YourStreet uses cookies. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other websites you visit. 

The YourStreet services are not intended to be used by minors under the age of 13 and YourStreet does not intentionally collect or maintain information from those visitors and users of the services who are under the age of 13. 

Your profile information is always available when you log in to the website using your username and password. You are free to change or delete any or all of your profile information at any time. However, if you delete your profile information, you may not be able to access your account. 

YourStreet uses your personal information only for the operation and maintenance of the service provided by this site. For example, your username will be used to identify you when you contribute content to the site, such as, in a discussion forum. 

YourStreet will not use or share your personal information in a manner that differs from what is described in this privacy statement without your prior consent. 

Unsubscribe instructions will accompany each newsletter or promotional communication you receive from YourStreet. 

YourStreet will send you strictly service-related announcements (such as, but not limited to, notices of any updates to our Services, Terms of Use, or Privacy Policy) when we believe it is necessary to do so. You may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature, but if you do not wish to receive these announcements, you have the option to delete your profile. You understand that any deletion of your profile involves deletion of your profile information from our live databases. 

When we delete information that we have collected from or about you, it will be deleted from our active databases but may remain in our archives. 

YourStreet protects the security of the personal information you provide. Personal information we collect is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access, and we carefully protect this information from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no company, including YourStreet, can fully eliminate security risks associated with personal information. 

YourStreet may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with legal process served on YourStreet or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of YourStreet; or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect personal safety of users of YourStreet, its websites, or the public. 

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy. When we do, we will also revise the 'last updated' date at the top of the Privacy Policy. We encourage you to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are protecting the personal information we collect. Your continued use of the service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any updates. 

In the unlikely event that YourStreet or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
