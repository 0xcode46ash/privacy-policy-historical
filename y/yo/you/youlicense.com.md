Privacy Policy 

**Effective Date: November 18, 2008**

YouLicense, Inc. (“we, our or us”) provides this Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information we receive when you visit youlicense.com (the “ **Site** ”) and when you use any part of our service or software via our Site (the “ **Service** ”). 

This Privacy Policy may be amended or updated from time to time. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will post a notice of these changes on our Site and in this Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes. 

**1\. Information Collection**

This Privacy Policy only applies to information you provide to us online while visiting or using our Site or the Service, or that we collect as part of the Service. It does not apply to information we have obtained offline or through other traditional means. Information you may provide in visiting or using our Site falls into two broad categories: personally identifiable information, and aggregate information. "Personally Identifiable Information" is information that is personal to you and which can be used to identify or contact you, such as your name, email address, financial information or mailing address. "Aggregate Information" is information that does not identify you, and may include, for example, statistical information concerning the web pages on our Site that users most frequent. Our Privacy Policy governs both categories of information, as detailed below. 

1.1 Personally Identifiable Information. 

We allow you to decide whether you wish to provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. Accordingly, we have structured our Site so that you may visit our Site, and review a range of information about bands, musicians and other materials relating to the music industry, without revealing your identity or providing any Personally Identifiable Information. 

One of our goals in creating this Site, however, is to enable bands and musicians to post information about themselves and their music, including but not limited to music, graphics, photos and sounds (“ **Content** ”) and to enable music promoters and other music professionals to access and conduct commercial transactions with respect to such Content, including the licensing and purchasing of various rights in the Content. 

In order to post any Content, perform certain transactions on the Site with respect to such Content, and in order to obtain access to certain other materials or information from our Site or portions of the Service, we ask that you become a registered user. Our registration forms will specify the information which you must provide in order to register and access and use certain features of the Site, including certain Personally Identifiable Information such as your email address, address and date of birth. 

When a user becomes a [paying member] of the Site, we collect credit card billing information including mailing address, and such other information as may be requested by us from time to time. 

1.2 Non Personally Identifiable Information: Aggregate Information 

Information concerning our users' activities at the Site such as which pages they visit, and how long they view these pages, date and time of the visit, and information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website such as your computer's Internet Protocol address, browser type, the web page you were visiting before you came to the Site - is Aggregate Information. This information does not identify a particular user, but does provide potentially useful data concerning our users' preferences and activities on the Site, and the effectiveness and interest of our Site's features. 

1.3 Cookies 

We collect Aggregate Information about your use of our Site through cookies and similar Internet technologies. "Cookies" are small text files that a website can use to recognize repeat users, to facilitate the user's ongoing access to and use of the website, and to compile aggregate data to improve the website and focus advertising. Cookies work as follows: we will send a cookie to your browser that uniquely associates your computer with information stored at the Site. Your browser places the cookie in its cookies file. When you next access the Site on your computer, the Site recognizes the cookie, makes the stored information available, and adds new information based on the present visit. 

You may choose not to allow us to collect information through cookies. If you wish, you can set your browser software to reject cookies, and most browsers provide instructions for disabling the cookies feature in their "Help" section. Because cookies can be used to provide certain functionality, if you disable your browser's cookies feature, certain elements of our Site may be unavailable to you. 

1.4 Advertisers' Collection of Information 

With Internet technology, it is possible for advertisers, as well as site hosts and other third parties, to collect information through the use of cookies and other technologies, such as so-called "clear GIF" files. We have no control over, and cannot necessarily protect against, the practices or policies of advertisers or other web site hosts using such technologies. 

1.5 User communications 

When you send email or other communications to us, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services. 

1.6 Other Websites 

We offer and provide access to the Site and the Service in connection with other websites. Personally identifiable information that you provide to those sites may be sent to us in order to enable use of the Site or deliver the Service. We process such information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit Personally Identifiable Information from you.  Other websites follow different rules regarding the use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information that you submit. We encourage you to read the privacy policies and other terms of the other websites. ****
