### What we collect and how we use it

Most of LifeChurch.tv's services do not require you to register for an account or provide any personal information. Depending upon the service in question, we may collect the following:

  1. **Information you provide.** When you sign up for a LifeChurch.tv account, a YouVersion account, or another LifeChurch.tv service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account with information from other LifeChurch.tv services or third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may allow you to opt out of combining such information.
  2. **LifeChurch.tv cookies.** When you visit LifeChurch.tv, we may send one or more cookies to your computer, so that we may uniquely identify your browser. (A cookie is simply a tiny text file containing a string of characters.) Accepting our cookies allows you to keep your user preferences from session to session. Although most browsers accept cookies by default, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies, or to tell you when you're being sent a cookie. Some LifeChurch.tv features and services may not function properly if you have cookies disabled.
  3. **Log information.** When you use LifeChurch.tv services, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends when you visit one of our websites. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.
  4. **User communications.** When you send email or other communication to LifeChurch.tv, we may retain those communications to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve our services.
  5. **Other sites.** This Privacy Policy applies only to web sites and services that are owned and operated by LifeChurch.tv. LifeChurch.tv cannot regular other sites linked from within our various web sites and services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. You should familiarize yourself with their unique Privacy Policies, should you choose to visit their sites.



LifeChurch.tv only processes personal information for the reasons described in the applicable Privacy Policy for specific services.

### Choices for Personal Information

When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If LifeChurch.tv would like to use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case LifeChurch.tv may not be able to provide those services to you.

### Information Sharing

LifeChurch.tv does not share your personal information with other institutions outside of LifeChurch.tv. However, LifeChurch.tv may share your personal information only if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms Of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of LifeChurch.tv, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

### Information Security

LifeChurch.tv takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to LifeChurch.tv employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

### Data Integrity

LifeChurch.tv processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.

### Accessing and updating personal information

When you use LifeChurch.tv services, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.

### Enforcement

LifeChurch.tv periodically reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints regarding privacy issues, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between LifeChurch.tv and an individual.
