# Privacy - Your Investment Property Australia

Protecting your privacy is important to Key Media. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the Key Media Customer Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information.

**Why we collect personal information**  
Key Media collects and uses your personal information to give you superior customer service, to provide you with convenient access to our products and services, and to make a wider range available to you. In addition, we use your personal information to keep you up to date on the latest conferences / events and magazine announcements.

**How we collect personal information**  
We collect information about you in several ways. For example, we might ask for your contact information when you correspond with us, register to attend a conference or event. In addition, when you register for a new Key Media conference, event or monthly update, we collect and store the information you provide in a secure database.

**When we disclose personal information**  
Because Key Media is a global company, your personal information may be shared with other Key Media business units in Singapore and Hong Kong. They will protect your personal information in accordance with the Key Media Customer Privacy Policy. Key Media may occasionally share your personal contact information with carefully selected partnering companies, to keep you informed about related announcements.

**How we protect your personal information**  
Key Media safeguards the security of the data you send us with physical, electronic, and managerial procedures. We urge you to take every precaution to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser.

Key Media does not knowingly solicit personal information from children or send them requests for personal information.

Key Media's website contains links to other sites. Key Media does not share your personal information with those websites and is not responsible for their privacy practices. We encourage you to learn about the privacy policies of those companies.

If we are going to use your personal information differently from that stated at the time of collection, we will try to contact you via email using the most recent information we have. If you have not given us permission to communicate with you, you will not be contacted, nor will we use your personal information in a new manner.

The Key Media Customer Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time. We encourage you to review the privacy policy regularly for any changes.
