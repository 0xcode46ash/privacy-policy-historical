This Policy expressly discloses the types of personal and non-personal information collected, used and stored as a result of your use of the Site and the YouNoodle Services.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated as part of the YouNoodle [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/terms). By using the Site and YouNoodle Services you consent to the practices disclosed in this Policy. If you do not want to consent to our Privacy Policy practices, please do not use the YouNoodle Services!

We take your privacy seriously. If you have any questions about this policy or about privacy at YouNoodle, please contact us at [support@younoodle.com](mailto:support@younoodle.com).

**1\. What Information is Collected & How is it Used?**

 **Data Collected When You Visit Our Site:** When a user visits the Site’s homepage, YouNoodle utilizes an electronic file, called a web beacon, to count users that have visited the Site. We do not use web beacons to track any activity related to user accounts. 

**Data Collected During Account Creation:** When you create an account to access the YouNoodle Services, you can sign up either with your email or through certain social media accounts. If you sign up directly with your email address, we will collect your First and Last Name, Email Address and ask you to create and confirm an account password. If you sign up using your Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn accounts, you will be asked for your account login information. By using third party social media accounts to create an account, you are allowing YouNoodle to access personal information in those accounts in order to pre-populate your account sign-up process with information from those accounts. All information is accessed by YouNoodle in accordance with the privacy policies of [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv).

**Data Collected When You Apply to Enter A Competition.** When you apply to enter a competition that is powered by the YouNoodle platform, you may be required to provide both personal information (such as your name, address, passport identification number, contact information, email, phone number, resume or biography) and information about your startup (such as a mission statement, pitch deck, financials, market strategy, etc.). The type of information collected is determined by the competition organizer in their sole and absolute discretion, and their collection and use of that information is governed by the rules, regulations, guidelines and privacy policy of a given competition organizer. Entrants should review the applicable rules and policies of a competition organizer to understand the scope of their collection, use and storage practices. 

**Data Collected When You Subscribe to or Purchase YouNoodle Software and Services.** When you subscribe to or purchase any YouNoodle Services, YouNoodle may additionally collect your email, first and last name, billing address, credit card number and security code in order to process the transaction. YouNoodle may also, upon request, mail an invoice to the mailing address provided by a user to facilitate payment. 

**Data Collected When You Like or Share Competitions.** Users may like, share or follow various competitions powered by the YouNoodle platform on Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. Users should review the privacy policies of [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv) for more detail about information collected from these sites.

**YouNoodle Cookie Policy.** We use cookies, small strings of numbers and letters that are placed on your browser. We use a persistent cookie that contains login information which automatically logs you in when you return to our website. We also use the Google analytics cookies to help us understand how users use our Site and to improve YouNoodle Services. If you login with your [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/privacy) and [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy?trk=hb_ft_priv) account, cookies may also be placed in accordance with their privacy policies. You can set your browser to remove or reject cookies; however some Site features or Services may not work properly without cookies.

**2\. How is Collected Information Used?**

 **Email addresses:** YouNoodle may utilize email addresses provided during the creation of an account to (i) confirm account creation and confirm the validity of information provided, (ii) send secure links to users to access the Site or YouNoodle Services, (iii) send confirmation of financial transactions; (iv) communicate with our users to provide information regarding YouNoodle Services or respond to user inquiries, or (v) notify users of material changes to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. By default users will receive YouNoodle’s monthly newsletters or targeted notifications regarding competitions, programs and opportunities available to startups by YouNoodle’s partners and clients. Users have the option to opt-out of these email updates if they prefer from the Account page. 

**Competition Submissions/User Content:** YouNoodle may share any part of your submitted data by an entrant with applicable competition administrators and judges. Users should assume that all data submitted through the competition is available to the competition administrators and judges unless the terms of the competition state otherwise. Judges can download information off the service so they can judge while they are offline. Judges may have access to personal information about the entrants, subject to the rules and regulations of the applicable competition. In addition, YouNoodle may utilize the information compiled in its database for commercial use to generate reports regarding trends in vertical markets, prepare profiles of top startups and to facilitate matchmaking and other communications between relevant third party entities and relevant startups. 

**Credit or Debit Card Information:** YouNoodle does not store any credit card data associated with any purchases processed on the Site. YouNoodle utilizes ChargeBee to process recurring payments and utilizes Stripe as a payment gateway for those payments. When you enter your payment information, Stripe sends us back a token that we store in our servers. This token is linked to but cannot be converted to your credit or debit card information. You should review [Stripe’s Privacy Policy](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) and [ChargeBee, Inc. Privacy Policy](https://www.chargebee.com/privacy.html) for more detail about how your information is collected, stored and maintained by these third party payment processors.

**Anonymous Data – Analytics:** YouNoodle utilizes Google Analytics to access anonymous data to help us understand how our Services are used. Google Analytics is a web analytics tool that helps YouNoodle understand how users engage with our Site, so that we can review and improve our Services. Google Analytics collects information anonymously. It provides a report to YouNoodle with website trends without identifying individual visitors. Site usage is tracked using Google Analytics in accordance with their [Privacy Policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245). However, if you do not want your data to be used by Google Analytics, you may opt-out by installing [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

**3\. Third Party Websites**

Our site contains links to other websites. When you click on one of these links, you are ‘clicking’ to another website. YouNoodle does not control the data collection or privacy practices of such third party sites. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of any third party sites, as their collection, use and storage practices and policies may differ from ours. 

**4\. Additional Circumstances When Disclosures May Be Made to Third Parties**

Information collected by YouNoodle may be disclosed when (i) we are required to do so by law, or (ii) in the event of a change of ownership.

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify users about law enforcement or court ordered requests for data unless otherwise prohibited by law. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defenses or objections that you may have to any third party request to compel disclosure of your information. 

**Acquisition/Merger/Assignment:** Information may be disclosed if YouNoodle is involved in any merger, acquisition or assignment of its interests. Under such circumstances, YouNoodle will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify its users if their personal information is to be disclosed or transferred and/or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

 **Security Measures:** We have implemented reasonable administrative, technical and physical security measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, destruction or alteration. For example: 

  * – SSL encryption (https) everywhere where we deal with personal data.
  * – You cannot retrieve a lost password; you can only set a new one once you receive a reset email. 
  * – Data is kept on secure servers, located in the US. 



**Payments Encryption:** YouNoodle utilizes only PCI-DSS compliant third party payment processors to ensure the security of your personal information. Users should review [Stripe’s Security Policy](https://stripe.com/help/security) before initiating transactions on the Site. 

**Large File – Storage Capacity:** You cannot submit images, animated .gifs, or any documents larger than 10 megabytes through our Services. Instead, you must provide a link to a publicly available version of the content. Like many companies, we store all YouNoodle data on Amazon Web Services servers in the United States. Please see [Amazon’s Privacy Policy](http://aws.amazon.com/privacy/) for more information. 

**Abuse Prevention:** YouNoodle uses reCapcha, a service from Google, to protect the Site from spam and abuse. Users should review reCapcha’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/) through Google for more information. 

Despite our best efforts, users should be advised that no method of transmission over the Internet and no method of storing electronic information can ever by 100% secure.
