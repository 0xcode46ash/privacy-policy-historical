# Younique - Uplift. Empower. Validate.

## Introduction

Younique, LLC, a company organized under the laws of the State of Utah (referred to herein as “Younique,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), understands the importance of privacy of individuals (referred to as “users” and “you”). This privacy policy applies to information collection and use, including while you are visiting and using our website (located at [https://www.youniqueproducts.com](https://web.archive.org/)) (the "Site"), our mobile applications (the “Apps”), or our other services that reference this privacy policy (the “Services”). Please note that, for the purposes of EU data protection laws, Younique is also the “data controller” (that is, the company responsible for, and which controls the processing of, your personal information).

By using the Site, the Apps, and/or the Services, you acknowledge the processing of your personal information by us as explained in this privacy policy.

* * *

### Information Collection

Younique may collect two different types of information: Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”) and Non-Personally Identifiable Information (“Non-PII”).

PII is information that identifies you as an individual or from which you are identifiable. This may include:

  * information (such as, your name, address, telephone number, email address, social media account information, birth date, taxpayer identification number and/or social security number, credit card information, billing address, purchase history, and shipping information) that you provide (i) by completing forms on the Site or the Apps, including any information you provide during the registration process to become a Younique Presenter or customer, or any information you provide to purchase products, or (ii) in connection with any Services, including if you register, upload, or submit any material via the Site or the Apps or enter into any competition or promotion we may sponsor;
  * in connection with an account sign-in facility, your log-in and password details;
  * the content of any communications you send to us, for example, to report a problem or to submit questions, concerns, or comments regarding the Site, the Apps, the Services, or any related content, as well as your preferred method of communication; and
  * information from surveys that we may, from time to time, run on the Site or the Apps, or in connection with the Services for research purposes, if you choose to respond to or participate in such surveys.



If you are a Younique Presenter, we may also collect your commission and bonus information. PII may be collected from, among other places, information you provide directly to us, information regarding the services that Younique currently provides or has previously provided to you, or information Younique receives from our affiliated entities, other Younique Presenters, or third parties relating to the establishment of our relationship or the provision of services to you. This information can be received in any manner, including in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications. If you are a customer or the host of an in-person or online Younique party, your PII may be provided to us by the Younique Presenter who took your order or who attended a Younique party that you hosted or attended.

The provision of PII by you is necessary in order for us to provide you with the services, and it is within the legitimate interests of Younique to process such PII in connection with the performance of any contractual relationship we may have with you. You are under no obligation to provide any such information. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

Non-PII is aggregate information. This may include demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. Non-PII may be connected to other information we collect from you.

* * *

### Information Use

Younique may use PII about you for the following purposes: (i) to establish or maintain our relationship with you; (ii) to contact you and respond to your requests and inquiries; (iii) to provide you with services you have requested; (iv) to keep you informed of products and services we think may be of interest to you; (v) to personalize your experience with us; (vi) to assist you while you use the Site, the Apps, or the Services; (vii) for business administration, including statistical analysis; (viii) to improve the Site, the Apps, or the Services by helping us to understand who uses the Site, the Apps, and/or the Services and how they are used; (ix) for fraud prevention and detection; and (x) to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and codes of practice.

### Disclosure of Information

Younique does not sell or lease PII about you to others.

Younique may share PII about you with others as permitted by contractual agreement or as required or permitted by law, such as our affiliates, other Younique Presenters, government entities and regulatory bodies, those with whom you have requested us to share information, third parties in order for them to provide us with services (including, for example, companies that provide us with technical support and assistance with respect to the Site, Apps, or Services, financial institutions who process payment for orders placed by you, our suppliers and other third parties who facilitate delivery of the products and services you have ordered, and third parties who assist us with research to help improve the Site, Apps, Services, and product offerings), or for any other purpose with your consent.

If you inquire about our products, services, or the Younique business opportunity, we may provide your contact details to a Younique Presenter in your local area to respond to your inquiry. Additionally, if you purchase Younique products or set up a customer account with us, we may share your name, location, contact details, and purchase history with Younique Presenters to help them establish and maintain a relationship with you. If you are a Younique Presenter, your name, location, contact details, and performance may be shared with other Younique Presenters. Additionally, PII about you may be shared with customers.

Younique requires third parties who perform services for us to agree to treat PII about you confidentially and securely and only for the purpose of performing services on our behalf. NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF OUR INDEPENDENT YOUNIQUE PRESENTERS. However, Younique Presenters agree, as specified in our Younique Independent Presenter Agreement, to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

Unless restricted by law, regulation, contract, or professional standards, Younique may transfer PII about you outside of the United States to other countries for the purposes described in this privacy policy. Younique will not share PII about you with an unaffiliated third party who is not performing services for us without first obtaining your permission, except if such sharing is otherwise permitted by this privacy policy.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this privacy policy to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose and use your PII if we believe that we are required or permitted to do so: (a) to our professional advisors, including lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, and auditors; (b) to debt collection agencies and other parties that assist with debt-recovery functions; (c) by law; (d) in response to legal process (for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena); (e) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; (f) to enforce our other terms, conditions, or policies; (g) to protect our operations; (h) to protect the rights, privacy, safety, or property of Younique, you, or others; and/or (i) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages we may sustain. For example, we may, to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities. We may also transfer your personal data to a third party that acquires all or part of our assets or shares, or that succeeds us in carrying on all or a part of our business, whether by merger, acquisition, reorganization, or otherwise.

Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we reserve the right to use Non-PII, and to disclose Non-PII to third parties, for any purpose.

* * *

### Your Rights

You may request access to the PII that Younique has about you. You may also request the correction, amendment, or deletion of PII about you that is inaccurate.

Younique will treat requests for access, correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you in accordance with its internal policies and applicable legal requirements.

* * *

### Information Security

Younique maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our personnel and the personnel of our affiliates are provided access to PII about you only if they have a need to know the information in connection with a legitimate business purpose, such as (a) the provision of services to you or (b) to help identify other services that Younique and its affiliates offer that may be of interest or use to you.
