# Younique - Uplift. Empower. Validate.

## Introduction

Younique, LLC, a company organized under the laws of the State of Utah (referred to herein as "Younique," "we," "us" and "our") understands the importance of privacy of individuals (referred to as "users" and "you"). This privacy notice outlines the personal information Younique may collect and how Younique will use and disclose that information.

* * *

### Information Collection

Younique may collect two different types of information, Personally Identifiable Information and Non- Personally Identifiable Information.

"Personally Identifiable Information" ("PII") is information that identifies you as an individual – for example, your name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, billing address and shipping information. "Non-Personally Identifiable Information" ("Non-PII") is aggregated information, demographic information, IP addresses, user behavior data from web interaction metrics tools and any other information that does not reveal your specific identity. In connection with our Presenter enrollment process, Younique may collect PII about you that may be considered sensitive. Younique may also collect PII about you from, among other places: information you provide directly to us, information regarding the services that Younique currently provides or has previously provided to you, information Younique receives from our affiliated entities or third parties relating to the establishment of our relationship or the provision of services to you. This information can be received in any manner, including in-person discussions, telephone conversations, and electronic or other written communications.

* * *

### Information Use

Younique may collect PII about you to establish or maintain our relationship with you, respond to your inquiries, provide you with services you have requested, keep you informed of services we think may be of interest to you, personalize your experience with us, and other reasons. Without PII, Younique may be unable to provide you with the services you have requested. 

* * *

### Disclosure of Information

Younique does not sell or lease PII about you to others. 

Younique may share PII about you with others as permitted by contractual agreement or as required by law, such as our affiliates, third parties in connection with the provision of services to you, government entities and regulatory bodies, and those with whom you have requested us to share information. Younique requires third parties who perform services for us to agree to treat PII about you confidentially and securely. 

Unless restricted by law, regulation, contract or professional standards, Younique may transfer PII about you outside of the United States to other countries for the purposes described in this privacy notice. Younique will not share PII about you with an unaffiliated third party who is not performing services for us without first obtaining your permission, except if such sharing is otherwise permitted by this privacy notice. 

Younique will provide PII about you to the following types of third parties for the associated reasons: 

Carriers: Younique will provide your name and address to companies which provide a delivery service between Younique and its customers as a means of delivering our products to you as quickly as possible. 

Financial Institutions: Younique will provide financial institutions with your payment information, name, address, and phone number in order to process any orders placed by you and complete payment of the transaction to Younique. 

Logistics: Younique will provide your name, address and phone number to those entities or people within our network of distribution in order to process and ship your orders with speed and accuracy. 

Younique requires third parties who perform services for us to agree to treat PII about you confidentially and securely. Note that this statement does not address the privacy practices or polices of our Independent Presenters. However, Younique Independent Presenters agree, as specified in our Policies and Procedures, to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations. 

Notwithstanding any other provision of this notice or the Terms and Conditions of Use to the contrary, we reserve the right to disclose and use your PII if we believe that we are required to do so: (a) by law; (b) in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena; (c) in response to a law enforcement agency’s request; (d) to enforce our other terms, conditions, or policies; (e) to protect our operations; (f) to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of Younique, you or others; and/or (g) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages we may sustain. For example, we may to the fullest extent the law allows, disclose PII about you to law enforcement agencies to assist them in identifying individuals who have been or may be engaged in unlawful activities. 

Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we reserve the right to use Non-PII, and to disclose Non-PII to third parties, for any purpose. NOTE THAT THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR POLICIES OF THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING YOUNIQUE PRESENTERS. However, Younique Presenters agree, as specified in our Policies and Procedures, to comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations.

### Access

You may request access to the PII that Younique has about you. You may also request the correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you that is inaccurate. 

Younique will treat requests for access, correction, amendment or deletion of PII about you in accordance with its internal policies and applicable legal requirements.

* * *

### Information Security

Younique maintains reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to protect PII from loss, misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction. Our personnel and the personnel of our affiliates are provided access to PII about you only if they have a need to know the information in connection with a legitimate business purpose, such as (a) the provision of services to you or (b) to help identify other services that Younique and its affiliates offer that may be of interest or use to you.
