# Your Purebred Puppy: Privacy Policy

### "What information do you collect about me?"

When you visit our site, we receive general information about the type of computer you're using, including IP address, browser and operating system, and which pages you visited.

We use this information only in aggregate form (as overall statistics) to help us evaluate how the general public navigates our site. For example, if we know that 25% of our visitors use the Chrome browser, or that 70% of our visitors read our page about Housebreaking, this is helpful information for improving our site. We don't share this information with anyone.

If you buy something from us, we receive only the information we need to process your order, such as your name, address, e-mail address, and payment details. We use this information only for billing purposes, to send you an order confirmation by e-mail, and to fulfill your order. Of course we need to share it with the merchant bank for authorization and approval of your payment, but we never share it with anyone else.

### Is it safe to buy from you over the Internet?

Yes. We've partnered with both _Paypal_ and _Authorizenet_ , a leading payment gateway since 1996, to offer safe and secure credit card transactions over the internet. Your information is encrypted (scrambled) so it can't be read by anyone else. You can shop at yourpurebredpuppy.com with confidence. Your private information is safe.

### If I contact you or buy something from you, will I get stuck on a mailing list?

Absolutely not. You won't receive any emails from us, other than an order confirmation if you buy something.

### Will you share my information or email address with anyone?

Absolutely not. Your information is kept strictly confidential. We don't sell, rent, disclose, or share it with anyone, except with the merchant bank for processing your payment if you buy something from us.

### Do you use cookies?

Yes, for website analysis and keeping track of what you've put in your shopping cart.

### Do I need to accept cookies in order to use your site?

No. If you set your browser to refuse cookies, that's perfectly okay. You can still enjoy our site. Just be aware that the shopping cart can't function without cookies enabled, so if you disable cookies, you won't be able to place an order.

### Are cookies harmless?

Yes. A cookie is just a tiny text file. It's not a computer program. It can't contain a virus. It can't "see" anything on your computer or change or take any data whatsoever from your computer. It really is harmless. But you don't need to accept cookies if you don't want to. You can still enjoy our site.

### Should I be concerned about spyware or adware on your site?

Nope. No spyware, adware, pop-up ads, spam, or any other annoying or intrusive marketing techniques.

### What if you change your privacy policy?

Any changes will be posted here, and will only apply on a going-forward basis, not a retroactive basis.

### Who can I talk to if I have a question about my privacy?
