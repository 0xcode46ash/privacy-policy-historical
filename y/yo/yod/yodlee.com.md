* **What categories of Personal Information does the My Yodlee Service collect?**

Yodlee collects the following categories of personal information about you throught the My Yodlee Service:

A. Registration Information: When you register for the My Yodlee Service, you will be asked for basic registration information, such as a My Yodlee ID and password which you choose, and an e-mail address for Yodlee Support. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the My Yodlee Service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the My Yodlee Service. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you.

B. Information on Your Use of the My Yodlee Service: As with most online businesses, My Yodlee logs information about your access and use of the My Yodlee web site, including (i) your transactions conducted on the My Yodlee web site, including through the use of Internet cookies (discussed below), (ii) the IP addresses from which you came to the site, and (iii) your communications with My Yodlee Service and web site. 

C. Information From Third Party Web Sites: In order to display information to you through the My Yodlee Service, the Service must collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from third party web sites and Internet services that you register on the My Yodlee Service. For example, if you register your credit card account through the My Yodlee Service, the Service will collect the transactional and payment information regarding your credit card account to display it to you on the My Yodlee web site.

D. Information From My Yodlee Service Partners: Yodlee may arrange for one or more services on the My Yodlee web site to be provided to you in whole or in part by a third party partner. For example, Yodlee may arrange for a third party partner to provide electronic funds transfer services to you on the My Yodlee web site. The services of these third party partners are governed by their privacy policies, not the My Yodlee Privacy Policy. This third party partner may share information with Yodlee on your transactions with them, for display on the My Yodlee web site and for other purposes. 

* **What categories of my Personal Information gathered through the My Yodlee Service does the My Yodlee Service disclose?**

Your personal information will never be sold or shared with any affiliated or unaffiliated third parties, except (i) to provide you with the My Yodlee Services, (ii) pursuant to joint marketing arrangements described below, or (iii) as required or permitted by law. 

For example, in order to provide you with the My Yodlee Services, My Yodlee may disclose your name and user passwords to third party web sites, such as web sites operated by a credit card company or a bank, in order to obtain the information that you requested be aggregated and displayed through the My Yodlee Service. When you register for the My Yodlee Service, you are deemed to authorize disclosures by Yodlee to provide the My Yodlee Service.

Yodlee may disclose registration information and information on your use of the My Yodlee Service (excluding information regarding transactions on your aggregated accounts) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf, or to other financial institutions with whom Yodlee offers you products and services pursuant to joint marketing agreements. For example, Yodlee may share your personal information with a nonaffiliated third party to respond to a subpoena, to protect and defend the rights and property of Yodlee, or to offer you a new service on the My Yodlee web site that is provided jointly by Yodlee and an unaffiliated company. 

Yodlee does present an opt-out option during registration for users who do not wish to share their information for joint marketing purposes as described in the prior paragraph. The user may change the opt-out choice at any time by going to the preferences page within the My Yodlee Service. Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case **personal information about you will never be disclosed.**

*  **Will I be contacted if I register for the My Yodlee Service?**

Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to inform them of new features, or to request participation in market surveys. The My Yodlee Service offers an opt-out option to users when signing up for the My Yodlee Service for those who do not wish to receive such messages. However, in order to ensure the quality of the My Yodlee Service, Yodlee will send certain types of messages from which users will not be able to opt-out. These include a "Welcome Notice" to confirm new membership, "notifications" of password changes or "account lockouts" and other "customer satisfaction" and "customer service" issues.

*  **Does the My Yodlee Service use cookies?**

The My Yodlee Service stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the My Yodlee Service. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your My Yodlee ID or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use cookies for a variety of purposes intended to make the My Yodlee Service a better service for you. For example, we use this cookie to identify existing users of the My Yodlee Service when they enter the web site so that we are able to pre-fill their My Yodlee ID and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new users. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in users, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the My Yodlee Service.

We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track user trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our users find valuable.

*  **How is my personal information protected and secured?**

At Yodlee, our number one focus is customer trust. We understand the need for our customer's personal data to be completely secure and private, and we have designed and deployed (as a part of the My Yodlee Service>) a state-of-the-art system to protect our customer's personal information.

Yodlee maintains physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard your personal information held by Yodlee relative to the My Yodlee Service. 

The My Yodlee database is physically protected at a secure, third party site and is monitored by security personnel twenty-four hours a day. Only authorized personnel can access the data center, and they must submit to multiple forms of identification including biometric authentication.
