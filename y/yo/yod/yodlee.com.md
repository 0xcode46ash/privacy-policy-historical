# Privacy Policy

When you register for our service, My Yodlee will ask you for basic registration information, such as a My Yodlee ID and password which you choose, and an e-mail address for Yodlee Support. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the My Yodlee service, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using My Yodlee. We will use this information only for providing the services and accessing the sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you. The information provided by users is encrypted and protected at all times by our strict privacy and security measures.

As with most online businesses, My Yodlee logs information about accesses to the My Yodlee site, including the IP addresses from which a member came to the site, in order to diagnose problems with the server, administer the My Yodlee site, and do aggregate statistical analysis. My Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which case, **a member's personally identifiable information will never be disclosed.**

**Note:** My Yodlee acts as your personal agent, communicating between you and the web sites you use. My Yodlee does not accept responsibility for the actions and policies of third party sites you access, either with regard to the personal information you have provided to them, or which you authorize My Yodlee to give to them for accessing their sites, or which they obtain through your use of their sites directly and/or through the My Yodlee service. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on those sites before signing up with or using them.
