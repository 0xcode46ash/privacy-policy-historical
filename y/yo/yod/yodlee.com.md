# Privacy Policy | Yodlee

In order to use the Yodlee Services, Yodlee requires you to create a Yodlee username and password. During registration you are required to give contact information such as name, address and email address. Specifically, Yodlee collects the following categories of personal information about you through the Yodlee Services:

**A. Registration Information:** When you register for the Yodlee Services, you will be asked for basic registration information, such as a username and password which you choose, name, address, demographic information (such as age, income) and an e-mail address for Yodlee Customer Service. Additional information may be required to utilize value-added features of the Yodlee Services, such as Auto-Registration and Password Reset, or to access specific third party Internet services using the Yodlee Services. This information may include your passwords and user names for the third party web sites and Internet services. We will use this information for providing the services you requested and accessing the web sites you select on your behalf, so that we can present the requested information to you but such information is not required to register for the Yodlee Services.

**B. Information on Your Use of the Yodlee MoneyCenter Service:** As with most online businesses, Yodlee logs information about your access and use of the Yodlee MoneyCenter web sites, including (i) your transactions conducted on the Yodlee MoneyCenter web sites, including through the use of Internet cookies (discussed below), (ii) the IP addresses from which you came to the site, and (iii) your communications with the Yodlee Services and web sites.

**C. Information From Third Party Web Sites:** In order to display information to you through the Yodlee Services, the Services must collect, on your behalf, your account and other personal information from third party web sites and Internet services that you register on the Yodlee Services. For example, if you register your credit card account through the Yodlee Services, the Service will collect the transactional and payment information regarding your credit card account to display it to you on that Yodlee Serviceâ€™s web site.

**D. Information From Yodlee MoneyCenter Service Partners:** Yodlee may arrange for one or more services on the Yodlee Services web sites to be provided to you in whole or in part by a third party partner. For example, Yodlee may arrange for a third party partner to provide electronic funds transfer services to you on the Yodlee Services web sites. The services of these third party partners are governed by their privacy policies, not the Yodlee Services Privacy Policy. This third party partner may share information with Yodlee on your transactions with them, for display on the Yodlee Services web sites and for purposes permissible under this Privacy Policy.

**E. Information From Security, Fraud and Risk Service providers:** Yodlee may arrange for one or more service providers to provide background information on you if you are performing financial transactions on the Yodlee Services web sites. Such providers may include federal authorities and watch list providers (e.g., OFAC) and also may include third party audit services that will protect Yodlee and you from account takeovers, phishing and other schemes designed to fraudulently use your account.
