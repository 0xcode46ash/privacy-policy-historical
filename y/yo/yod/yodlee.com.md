  1. #### What information does Yodlee ask for and how is it used?

When you voluntarily register for our service, Yodlee will ask you for basic registration information (a Yodlee ID, a password which you can choose, e-mail address), general information (gender, age, Zip code, interests, source of referral) and optional information (household income, title/function). Yodlee will occasionally contact users by electronic mail to inform them of new features, to request participation in market surveys, or to inform users of Yodlee and partner promotions. However, Yodlee does offer an opt-out option to users when signing up for the service who do not wish to receive such messages, In order to ensure the quality of the service, Yodlee will send certain types of messages from which users will not be able to opt-out. These include a welcome notice to confirm new membership, notifications of password changes or account lockouts and other customer satisfaction and customer service issues. 

Information provided is used to better customize the experience for each member. In the future, we may present new products and services that are better suited to the needs and interests of our members. 

To access third party Internet services using Yodlee, you may also be required to provide additional information. This information will only consist of the information required by the third party service itself, for access. We will use this information only for accessing the services you select on your behalf, so we can present the requested information to you. Yodlee also logs information about accesses to the Yodlee site, including the IP addresses from which a member came to the site, to diagnose problems with the server, administer the Yodlee site, and do aggregate statistical analysis. Additionally, Yodlee reserves the right to share aggregated information with third parties in which cases **a member's personally identifiable information will not be disclosed**. 

**Note:** Yodlee acts as your personal agent, communicating between you and the web sites you use. Yodlee does not accept responsibility for the actions and policies of third party sites you access, either with regard to the personal information you have provided to them, or which you authorize Yodlee to give to them for accessing their sites, or which they obtain through your use of their sites directly and/or through the Yodlee service. You should be careful to review any privacy policies posted on those sites before signing up with or using them. 

  2. #### Does Yodlee use cookies?

Yodlee stores a cookie on your computer if you have cookies enabled. If you do not have cookies enabled, you will be unable to use the Yodlee service. A cookie is simply a text file, which indicates your Yodlee ID or session identification number. This cookie will only be returned to our server if your browser is set to allow sending of cookies (you can also set it to check for permission before sending cookies). We use this cookie to identify existing members of the service when they enter the web site so that we are able to prefill their Yodlee ID and so that they may receive a start page more optimized for current subscribers than for new members. We also use a cookie to maintain session information for logged in members, to prevent the need for re-entry of login information when browsing outside the Yodlee service. 

We reserve the right to use cookies to deliver content specific to your needs and interests. We may also use cookies to track member trends and patterns in order to better understand and improve areas of our sites that our members find valuable. 

We reserve the right to use outside ad companies to display ads on our sites. These ads may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies, and we do not have access to this information. 

  3. #### Do I get to choose what information I disclose?

You will only be required to disclose the information to Yodlee that is required to voluntarily register for the service, or to access third party services you wish to access through Yodlee. 

  4. #### Who has access to my personal information?

Customer data is stored in encrypted format in our database, and is transmitted in that encrypted format within the network. This database is kept behind firewalls for additional security. Your Yodlee password is also encrypted in such a manner that no one has access to it. No Yodlee.com employee can view or retrieve your password. Should you forget your password, you will need to re-register for the service, unless you have enabled the automated password reset feature. The automated password reset feature prompts you with a series of questions, which when answered correctly, causes the service to email your password to your email address.

The Yodlee.com database is physically protected at a secure, third-party site and is monitored by security personnel and under surveillance twenty-four hours a day. Only authorized personnel can access the data center, and they must submit multiple forms of identification including biometric authentication (hand print scan). 

Yodlee may under certain circumstances disclose information when we reasonably believe that such action is necessary to (1) conform with legal requirements or comply with legal processes; (2) protect and defend the rights and property of Yodlee; or (3) protect the legal interests of our members or other third parties.

  5. #### What if I need to change the personal information I previously disclosed?

The Yodlee site includes a member profile update form for reviewing or updating personal information needed for accessing sites. If you are unable to change this information through the member profile form provided, you can use our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact.html) form to request the change. We do not currently provide an interface for changing access information for third party sites via the Yodlee site. To change this information you will need to follow the procedures set forth by the third party sites themselves. 

  6. #### Who can I contact if I have any questions regarding my privacy?

You can contact Yodlee for any questions or suggestions you have via our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/contact.html) form. For more information regarding privacy you can visit the following sites: 

    * TRUSTe and BBB Online provide web site certification programs.
