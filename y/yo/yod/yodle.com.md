## Information

#### Information Yodle May Collect

Yodle may collect different types of Information from Users, including identifying information, non-identifying information, and anonymous browsing information, collectively referred to as “Information” in this Policy.

A. Identifying Information.  Yodle may collect identifying information provided by any User, including, but not limited to, a first and last name; a home, business, or other physical address; a telephone number; an email address, as well as any other identifying information that may be submitted via the Site, included in an e-mail or conveyed in a telephone call (collectively, “Identifying Information”).  In general, Yodle collects Identifying Information from Site Users in connection with inquiries about Yodle’s services and notes the referring URL (e.g., the search engine that directed you to Yodle).  If a User sends an email to a Yodle agent, employee and/or affiliate, Yodle may store the Information provided in connection with that e-mail.  In addition, Yodle records and monitors User communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via e-mail and telephone.  By engaging in communications with Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates via e-mail and/or telephone, you consent to such recording and monitoring.

B. Anonymous Browsing Information and Non-Identifying Information.  Yodle may collect general, non-identifying, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on.  Yodle collects this information through the use of “cookies”, and Yodle may aggregate this information.  A cookie is a small text file that a website transfers to an individual’s computer, mobile device, or tablet for record-keeping purposes.  For example, Yodle may use cookies to collect information about Site activity.  You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.  Anonymous browsing and non-identifying information is not used, nor is it intended to be used, by Yodle to identify an individual.

#### How Yodle May Use Information

Yodle may retain and use Information collected from Users for quality assurance purposes, including: (i) facilitating a User inquiry or request; (ii) ensuring that Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates have communicated with you in accordance with Yodle’s policies; (iii) confirming your understanding of the information communicated to you by Yodle agents, employees and/or affiliates; (iv) confirming the terms of any agreement with its customers; (v) enforcing its agreements with its customers; (vi) training its agents, employees and/or affiliates; (vii) preventing fraud and other prohibited or illegal activities; (viii) for other legally permissible purposes; and (ix) generally to ensure that Yodle complies with applicable laws. 

Yodle reserves the right to send you certain communications relating to the Site or the services provided by Yodle, such as service announcements, e-mails related to your account, or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

## Security

Yodle takes commercially reasonable security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of Information.  These include internal reviews of Yodle’s data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where Information is stored.  Yodle employees with access to Information are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.

Yodle wants you to feel confident using the Site and providing Information to us.  However, no system can be completely secure.

In the event of a breach of the confidentiality or security of your identifying information, we will notify you if reasonably possible and as reasonably necessary so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may notify you under such circumstances using the e-mail address(es), if any, we have on record for you. You should also take care with how you handle and disclose your identifying information. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s Web site at <http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm> for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
