**PRODÉGÉ Privacy Policy**

PRODÉGÉ LLC owns and operates a number of different sites on the Web (each, “ PRODÉGÉ LLC. "). PRODÉGÉ LLC. is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of its user community. The intent of this privacy policy is to detail the information PRODÉGÉ LLC. may gather about individuals who visit the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites, how that information is used, and PRODÉGÉ LLC. disclosure practices. Please note that this policy applies only to the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites, and not to the Web sites of other companies or organizations to which we provide links. 

**Anonymous User Information:**

PRODÉGÉ LLC. Collects some anonymous information each time you visit PRODÉGÉ LLC. Site so we can improve the overall quality of your online experience. We collect your IP address, referral data, and browser and platform type. You do not have to register with PRODÉGÉ LLC. before we can collect this anonymous information. The PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address, in order for you to use the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites. The PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites assign an anonymous ID number to your requests and links the following additional data to that number: the date and time you visited the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Site, your search terms, and the links upon which you choose to click. Like most standard Web site servers, we use log files to collect and store this anonymous user information. PRODÉGÉ LLC. analyzes the information to examine trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

**Tell-A-Friend:**

If you elect to use our referral service for informing a friend about any of our sites, we ask you for your friend's name and email address. PRODÉGÉ LLC. will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Site. PRODÉGÉ LLC. does not store the information related to your friends and the one-time email sent pursuant to your input will be our only contact with that person for such input. 

**Correspondence:**

If you contact PRODÉGÉ LLC . , we may keep a record of that correspondence and we may collect your email address. 

**Third Party Information Gathering:**

The PRODÉGÉ LLC . Sites include content and ads from third parties that may perform user activity tracking other than that described herein. For more information about each third party content provider, cookies, and how to "opt-out", please refer to such third party advertiser's privacy policy 

The PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites contain links to other sites on the Web. Please be aware that PRODÉGÉ LLC. is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. 

**Cookies:**

PRODÉGÉ LLC. May set and access PRODÉGÉ LLC. or partner cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small data file that a Web site may send to your browser and which may then be stored on your system. We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. For the session cookie, once you close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

We use cookie and web beacon technology to track which pages on the PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites our visitors view and which Web browsers our visitors use. We may also use cookies to help us provide personalized features and preferences to you within various PRODÉGÉ LLC. Sites in a way that may be linked to individual user information that you elect to share with us. We also use "action tags" to assist in delivering the cookie. These action tags allow us to compile statistics and other data about our customers on an aggregate basis, by embedding a random identifying number on each user's browser. Then we track where that number shows up on our site. 

**Sharing:**

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with current judicial proceeding, a criminal investigation, a court order, or legal process served on our Web site. We may also share your personal information if we believe it is necessary in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of PRODÉGÉ LLC. or such PRODÉGÉ LLC. Site's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

**Mergers; Business Transitions:**

In the event PRODÉGÉ LLC. goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

**Choice/Opt-out:**

We desire to keep you in control of the personal information you provide to us. Accordingly, you can review, correct, change or remove the personal registration information you provide to PRODÉGÉ LLC. and that PRODÉGÉ LLC. controls. In order to elect not to receive future communications from us, please email us at [info@prodege.com](mailto:info@prodege.com).

**Notification of Changes:**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement in places deemed appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

If, however, we are going to use Individually Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days. 

**Special Notification with respect to Children's Privacy (Users under the age of 13):**

In response to concerns about protecting children's privacy online, Congress enacted the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 ("COPPA"), which sets forth rules and procedures governing the ways in which Web sites may collect, use and disclose any personal information for children under the age of 13. In accordance with PRODÉGÉ LLC. policy and COPPA regulations, we DO NOT: 

  1. Request or knowingly collect personally identifiable information online or offline contact information from users under 13 years of age; or 
  2. Knowingly use or share personal information from users under 13 years of age with third parties; 



It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information given to us or pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately delete the information from our servers 

Questions regarding children's privacy should be directed to:
