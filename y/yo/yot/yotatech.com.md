**_Answers_**

Does YotaTech ask for personal information?

  * We do not require you to divulge any personal information to read the forums, but in order to post you are required to enter a valid email address in order to register.
  * This is usedÂ  for the boards own protection against spammers who make bogus accounts and try to post info about their products, and to help us keep track of malicious users.
  * You can choose to not reveal your email address on the forum for anyone else to see.

Does YotaTech use any personal information it may gather?

  * The only information we need from the membership is a valid email address so you can sign up, and so the board can email you a lost password if you lose yours.

Will YotaTech sell or disclose any of your personal information?

  * We will never give out your private information to a 3rd party or to anyone unless you authorize it.

What about kids?

  * The overall safety of children is very important to us here at YotaTech. Children should get their patents permission before partaking in any type of an online discussion.
  * Children should also be encouraged to not give out any personal info while online.

Does YotaTech use cookies?

  * Cookies can be enabled or disabled by the members here. The benefit of using cookies is that it will display the correct time on the forums posts for you, and also the live clock that the forum uses.
  * They are also used for keeping track of which posts you have already viewed, and for telling you which new posts have been composed since you were away when you click on the "[View new posts](http://www.yotatech.com/search.php?s=&action=getnew)" at the top right of the forums index page.
  * Cookies are also used so you do not have to log in every time you open up your browser and surf on over to YotaTech if you so choose to remain logged in all the time.
  * If you wish to log out of the forum if you will be away from your PC for an extended period, you will find on the main  [ index ](http://www.yotatech.com/) [ page](http://www.yotatech.com/) in the lower right there is a place to log out.

Does YotaTech use my IP address in anyway?

  * YotaTech may collect IP addresses for the purpose only of tracking a malicious user who is abusing the system, or for the harassment of other members. Then the IP can be used to block an abuser from posting on the forums.

What else should I know about my privacy?

  * Any information you divulge on a public forum can be collected by a 3rd party without your knowledge. For example any info you type in chat, email, or on BBS's can be collected and used by others. If you post your email address for example, a spammer could take your address and add it to his list for future emailings.
  * Like was mentioned earlier, you can in your setting in your Control Panel turn off your email address from being visible. Members can still contact you if you leave the option to receive Private Messages is turned on. I would in my opinion at least have that feature enabled as a member may want to contact you privately without the whole board seeing their message.
  * Only you can protect your personal information is deciding what and how much you want to post in your posts about yourself. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact any staff member or  [email me](mailto:corey@yotatech.com?SUBJECT=Question%20on%20forum%20privacy).
