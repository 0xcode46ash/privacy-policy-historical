## Privacy

We at YP.Com are constantly striving to provide excellent service to you, our customers and business partners, while building a long-lasting relationship with you. To achieve these goals, we occasionally need information about you when you visit our site.

First and foremost, YP.Com respects your right to privacy. When you visit YP.Com, you may be providing information to YP.Com on two different levels about your visit:

• Anonymous statistics collected as you browse the site,

• And personal information you knowingly give us.

We want you to be aware of how we handle this information. 

### Our Commitment to Your Privacy

YP.Com would like to assure you that we do not:

• Collect personal information from you unless you provide it to us.

• Provide or sell the names and addresses of our customers [site users] to outside vendors.

YP.Com does:

• Safeguard customers' information from unauthorized access.

• Collect, maintain and use customer information as necessary to provide the most helpful and targeted products and services to meet customers' needs (e.g. customer care or new products or services).

• Honor customers' requests to remove their names from our telephone or mail solicitation lists. (Just contact us.).

• Maintain confidentiality of customer information when undertaking projects with other companies.

YP.Com has always valued your privacy, and we reinforce this belief throughout our organization. Your information will be protected as described unless the specific web page says otherwise. If you have further questions about our privacy policy, please contact us. 

## Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

### Statistics about your visit

As you browse the site, YP.Com's computers collect information about your visit, not about you personally. Via web server logs and browser cookie files, we monitor statistics such as:

• How many people visit our site

• Which pages people visit on our site

• From which domains our visitors come (e.g., "aol.com")

• Which browsers people use to visit our site

While we gather this information, none of it is associated with you as an individual. We use these statistics to improve our web site, to monitor its performance, and to make it easier for you and other visitors to use. 

### Organizational and personal information you knowingly give us

Within the YP.Com web site, you may be asked to give us personal or organizational information when you ask a question that requires a response, request rate information online, or order a service online. This information may range from your generic zip code, to your specific phone number, account number, a credit card number, e-mail address, organization URL, business description, business graphics, or mailing address. 

## Use of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

### Your IP Address and Host Name

YP.Com's web site logs Host Names and IP addresses (when the Host Name is not available) for systems administration and security purposes. These logs are monitored and analyzed to maintain systems and information security and allow us to constantly improve the value and the availability of the web content. 

### YP.Com Registration Forms

We encourage all visitors to register with YP.Com, although registration is not required, except for access to our premium content areas. The registration forms require users to give us accurate contact information (like name and e-mail address) and preferences that help us better serve you. Your name and e-mail address are used to send you information about our company, product updates, special offers, and newsletters. You may change your preferences at any time, or remove your name entirely from our user registry. 

### Order Forms and Enrollment Forms

Our order forms securely collect visitor's contact information and financial information (like your credit card number and other billing information). Contact information on the order form is used for order fulfillment and may be shared with our Partners or Resellers if that is necessary to fulfill your request. The information that we require on our order form is only used to process your order quickly and accurately. Your contact information will only be used to send you the product that you purchase and your billing information will only be used to bill you for that product. During the purchasing process, you may be given the opportunity to sign up for future e-mailings regarding our products, services, and promotions. If you sign up here, YP.Com will share your contact information with other YP.Com companies only, not with other companies.

As YP.Com's online systems become more sophisticated, you may also be given the option of registering a profile with YP.Com. This would store your name, purchase history, and billing information to make it easier for you to shop and purchase products/services from us in the future. Once profiling is available, you may opt out of this feature at any time by changing/canceling your profile online. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a small, encrypted data string our server writes to your hard drive that contains your unique YP.Com User ID. We use cookies to deliver web content specific to your interests and to control access to YP.Com premium content. A cookie cannot be used to access or otherwise compromise the data on your hard drive. You can choose to change your browser settings to disable cookies if you do not want us to establish and maintain a unique YP.Com User ID. Please be aware that cookies may be required to complete certain functions on YP.Com. 

## Sharing of the Information this Site Gathers/Tracks

The information you submit on the order form is never shared with any third parties unless it is necessary to complete your request. Also, as required by law, YP.Com will not share customer proprietary network information with other YP.Com companies, unless you give YP.Com permission to do so (either online, or via phone or mail). 

## Information Security

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. When you place an order, the information you submit is encrypted using the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. 

## Links to Other Sites

The YP.Com web site contains links to other web sites. Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these sites. 

## Opt-out Policy

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us and our Partners at the point where we request information about the visitor. Visitors who wish to remove their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service can contact us. 

## Privacy Policy

The Site is a general audience site. We do not currently collect any personal information from children under the age of thirteen (13) on the Site. If in the future, we collect personally identifiable information from children, we will do so in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (15 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.). 

## Third-Party Ad Serving & Audience and Traffic Measurement Services

The Site may use third party network advertisers to serve the advertisements on the Site and may use a traffic measurement service to analyze the traffic on the Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on your visits to this Site and other Web sites you have visited. Third-party ad serving enables us to target advertisements to you for products and services you might be interested in. Although advertisers and other companies do not have access to your cookies as provided by the Site, the Site's third party network advertisers, the advertisers, the sponsors, and/or traffic measurement services may themselves set and access their own cookies on your computer if you choose to have cookies enabled in your browser. These third party cookies are set for purposes including but not limited to targeting advertisements to you that you might be interested in, to prevent you from seeing the same advertisements too many times and to conduct research regarding how useful certain advertisements are to you. Note that any images (or any other parts of a web page) served by third parties in association with third party cookies may serve as web beacons, which enable third parties to carry out the previously described activities. Third party cookies are governed by each third party's specific privacy policy, not this one. Please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp in order to learn more about the information collection practices and "opt-out" procedures of third party ad servers we may use. 

## Web Beacons

Consistent with standard practice within the web publishing industry, web pages throughout the Site may contain electronic images (generally, single-pixel ".gif" images) called "web beacons." These web beacons allow SITE to access certain cookies that were set in a domain different from that which is displayed in the current web page's address bar. SITE's use of web beacons, includes, without limitation, the following: 

• SITE may use web beacons within the Site in order to count unique users (actually, unique web browsers), visits and page views. Unique browser recognition is possible through the use of web beacons and associated cookies that may be managed by a third party site analytics partner.

• SITE may use web beacons to monitor SITE traffic and conversion patterns through our various product and service offerings. For example, web beacons may be integrated into a merchandise product page as well as the subsequent shopping cart, transaction and verification pages. This allows us to determine the most appropriate methods to serve our transaction-oriented customers.

• SITE includes web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages in which we are able to include graphics). These beacons allow us to determine whether or not email messages were opened, links were clicked and notifications/offers were acted upon. 

## Third Party Advertising

The ads appearing on this Web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. Information about your visit to this site, such as number of times you have viewed an ad (but not your name, address, or other personal informa-tion), is used to serve ads to you on this site.
