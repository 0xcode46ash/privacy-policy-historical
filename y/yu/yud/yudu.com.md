# YUDU Library - Privacy-policy

  


###### Overall privacy statement

Our websites are designed to allow authors/editors/publishers (collectively, 'Authors') a wider distribution of their work, to the benefit of interested readers ('Readers') by making them available on the internet. Anyone who accesses our sites, whether as an Author or a Reader, is regarded as a 'User'. YUDU Ltd may differentiate between Authors and Readers with respect to the gathering, use and sharing of User information, but for purposes of this Privacy Policy each User should assume that the entire Policy applies to such User. 

We take User confidentiality and privacy seriously. Because we gather certain types of information about our Users, we want to help you understand the terms and conditions surrounding the collection and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses the types of information we gather, how we use it, and how to correct or change it.

We may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name, company name, email addresses, postal addresses, phone numbers, mobile numbers. We may also collect other sensitive information such as your job title, gender, and username. Passwords are not stored directly; we use a hash of the password to maintain security.

###### Cookies

'Cookies' store a small amount of data on your computer about your visit to our sites. Cookies are active in some portions, but not all portions, or our site. Cookies by themselves do not tell us anything about you. We need to combine them with the personally identifiable information you give us. We then use this information to improve our services.

We also use technologies, including electronic images - sometimes called transparent GIFs, clear GIFs, or beacons - that allow us to track general user-traffic patterns. We also automatically receive and record information from our servers and from your browser, including your IP address, the time of your visit to pages on our site, and information about pages you visited. Unless you have registered for one of our products or services, the information we gather through the use of tracking technologies cannot be matched with any personally identifiable information about you. 

We use cookies and tracking technologies in a variety of ways, including: 

  * Keeping count of return visits to our sites;
  * Accumulating and reporting anonymous, aggregate (data collected in mass), statistical information on Web-site and advertisement usage;
  * Determining which features our overall user population likes best;
  * Saving your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our sites;

By using a cobranded service you grant us permission to pass your registration information back to that partner, whose use is subject to their applicable privacy policies.
  * We may hire third-party vendors to provide specialized services, who are only allowed to use the information to do their jobs, and not for their own use.
  * You decline a mailing that we send to you on behalf of a third party, in which case. we may share your removal instruction so that it may be added to the third party's 'do not contact' list.
