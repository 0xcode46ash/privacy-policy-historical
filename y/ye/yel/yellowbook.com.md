# Yellowbook Privacy Policy at Yellowbook.com

This statement explains our privacy policy with regard to our data protection practices. It is important for yellowbook.com to safeguard its users' privacy while providing a valuable and personalized service.

## What information does this website gather?

Yellowbook collects personally identifiable information that you knowingly provide to us. For example, if you register to post or to provide ratings & reviews, Yellowbook may ask you to provide personally identifiable contact information (such as name and email address). You would also provide us with personally identifiable information if you sign up for a free listing, including First Name, Last Name, Business Name, Address, Phone and Email Address.

As you navigate through **yellowbook.com** your browsing activity is automatically retrieved. This is used online in aggregate form: no individual user is identified. This aggregated data allows us to analyze site traffic and thus improve on the relevancy of services provided for you. For instance, based on the choices you make as you visit the site, we may want to recommend information that will be of interest to you. We may also provide "aggregated" statistics about users to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will not include information that would allow the recipient to identify any particular individual.

## How does Yellowbook use information collected on this website?

When users provide personally identifiable information to us through this website, we may use such personally identifiable information in the same way as we would use the same information obtained in a traditional non-electronic manner. For example, we may use personally identifiable information to publish your name, address, and phone number in our directories (unless you have asked us not to publish your number), to contact you in connection with user reviews and/or to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. When users provide personally identifiable information in connection with a feature on this website, we may also use such personally identifiable information in connection with the operation of such feature.

We may also use personally identifiable information you provide to communicate with you (e.g., to send you emails) and to otherwise serve you. For example, we may use your name and email address to send you emails to (a) provide information regarding our company, marketing information about products and services, and newsletters, (b) conduct online surveys, (c) confirm orders placed online and (d) otherwise communicate with you. However, you may request not to receive (i.e., "opt-out" of receiving) commercial email messages from us, by unchecking the checkbox beside the "I wish to receive updates and information from Yellowbook" line on the registration page. Please note that we reserve the right to send certain types of email messages that are not subject to opt-out, including those who have opted out of receiving commercial email messages.

In addition, Yellowbook may use personally identifiable information you provide and information Yellowbook automatically collects through this website (and may combine personally identifiable information you provide with information Yellowbook automatically collects through this website and non-personally identifiable information you knowingly provide) as it deems appropriate to protect its property or other rights (for example, to enforce any policies or contractual provisions regarding copyright, use of the "ratings and reviews" feature or the "save and send" feature).

## What about cookies?

Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences on particular sites, thus enabling website owners to provide more useful features for their users. The use of cookies is an industry standard. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to take full advantage of a website if you do so.

## Third Party Advertising

Yellowbook utilizes Third Party Ad Networks as part of its online display advertising. These companies may use anonymous and non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically place a cookie or third party web beacon on your computer to collect such non-personally identifiable and anonymous information about you. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you may visit the Network Advertising Initiativeâ€™s website at [http://www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) and its opt-out page at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp>.
