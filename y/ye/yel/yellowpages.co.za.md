### Privacy Policy Updates

This Privacy Policy supersedes and replaces all previously posted Privacy Policies.

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes to this Policy and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

### Display Advertising:

We will not facilitate the merging of personally-identifiable information with non-personally identifiable information previously collected from Display Advertising features that is based on the DoubleClick cookie unless we have robust notice of, and the user's prior affirmative (i.e., opt-in) consent to, that merger.

The Google Analytics features we've implemented based on Display Advertising (e.g., Remarketing, Google Display Network Impression Reporting, the DoubleClick Campaign Manager integration, or Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting).

Using the Ads Settings, visitors can opt-out of Google Analytics for Display Advertising and customize Google Display Network ads.  
We are encouraged to point visitors to Google Analytics' [currently available opt-outs](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) for the web.

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online.

Third-party vendors, including Google, may show our ads on sites across the Internet.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone's past visits to our website.

We and third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to report how our ad impressions, other uses of ad services, and interactions with these ad impressions and ad services are related to visits to our site.

How we use data from Google's Interest-based advertising or 3rd-party audience data (such as age, gender, and interests) with Google Analytics.

Because laws across countries and territories vary, and because Google Analytics can be used in many ways, Google is unable to provide the exact language we need to include in our privacy policy. We understand the unique aspects and special considerations of our business, and our privacy policy should account for this information that only we can provide.
