We may use your order history to send you information we think you may be interested in.

Unless you tell us otherwise, when you sign up for a free line entry or register or attend one of our events, we will contact you every now and again to see if you are interested in buying any advertising from us. If you order any of our products and services, we will contact you every now and again with news from the Yell group, with information about our products and services and to see if you would like to renew or buy more advertising from us.

If you advertise with us, we may share any business address you give us with your customers on a case by case basis if there is a genuine consumer dispute, whether or not your address is published in your advertising and whether or not you agree for us to share it.

Every now and again, we receive requests for information from government departments, the police and other enforcement agencies. If this happens, and there is a proper legal basis for providing your personal information, we will provide it to the organisation asking for it. 

## 6 Where we process your personal information

When we use your information as described in section 2 - How we will use information we collect about you, this may occasionally involve sending your information outside the European Economic Area (EEA). Where we do this, we make sure that appropriate steps are taken to protect your personal information and your rights. By providing us with your personal information, you agree that we may transfer, store and process your information outside the EEA.

## 9 Why we link to other websites

Our websites contain hyperlinks to websites that are owned and operated by other organisations. These websites have their own privacy and cookie policies, and we urge you to read them. They control how your personal information is used when you give it to these other organisations or they collect it with cookies. We do not approve any other websites and we are not responsible for any information, material, products or services that are on or accessible through those websites or for the privacy practices of websites run by other organisations. If you use these other websites you do it at your own risk.

## 10 Using cookies on our websites and how you can reject them

A cookie is a piece of information that a website transfers to the cookie file of the browser on your computer's hard disk so that the website can remember who you are. Cookies can help to display the information on a website in a way that matches your interests. Most major websites use cookies. Cookies cannot be used by themselves to identify you. We use two types of cookie on our websites.

The first type is a 'session-based' cookie. This means that it is only saved on your hard disk for the time you are using our website. On our websites, this cookie helps the website to 'remember' that you are logged into the site. If you log in and then don't do anything for 20 minutes you will get a message telling you that your session has timed out and that you need to log in again. This is a security measure to help us protect your information. 

We only use the second type of cookie on Yell Direct, not on Yell Business or any of our other advertiser-focussed websites. It stays on your hard disk for up to five years. This 'persistent' cookie helps us understand the number of different people coming to Yell Direct, rather than the total number of times the site is used. Without the persistent cookie, if you visited Yell Direct once each week for three weeks we would count you as three separate users. We also use them for research surveys, to make sure you are not invited to fill in a questionnaire too often, or after you have already done so. 

We do not store any of your personal information in either type of cookie. We do not link cookies to information you have given us during registration. We only use cookies to help us make the services we offer on our websites better for all our advertisers.

If you do not want a website to create a cookie on your computer, most web browsers provide the option to disable them. However, our websites may not work properly if you reject our cookies.

If you want to know more about how cookies work and how to manage or delete them, visit the [World Wide Web Consortium's website](http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/wwwsf2.html#CLT-Q10) or visit the [Interactive Advertising Bureau's website](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/).

**Web beacons**

A web beacon – sometimes called a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) or pixel tag – is a line of code that we have installed on some of our pages to help us learn more about how our visitors make use of the content and services that we offer, and to count how often people visit different areas of our websites. A web beacon is invisible to you and doesn't affect the content you see.

Web beacons help us provide a better service to you by allowing us to understand which areas of our websites are more popular with visitors than others. We do not use web beacons to collect any personal information about you, but they allow us to build up general information about how people use our site. Certain pages on our websites may also contain web beacons put in place by our advertising agencies so that we can measure how useful our advertising on other websites is. Web beacon files let our agency recognise a unique cookie on your web browser, which in turn means we can learn which adverts bring users to our websites. The web beacon only records a limited amount of information that includes the cookie number, the page ID and the time and date you accessed the page. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number or email address.

[Find out more about web beacons](http://www.yell.com/legal/cookies/home.html#11).

  


## 11 What rights you have in your personal information and how can you use them

You have the right to ask us not to use your personal information for marketing purposes. We will usually tell you when we collect your personal details if we are planning to use them for marketing purposes or if we plan to pass them to any other organisation for marketing purposes. For more information, please read section 4 - Direct Marketing and how you can manage your marketing preferences.

You have the right to see information we hold about you, (with some exceptions, which are described in the privacy laws). If you would like a copy of your personal information, you should contact our [data protection officer](mailto:privacy.officer@yellgroup.com). You will need to pay a processing fee of £10.

You have the right to review and update your personal details. You can do this quickly and easily through Yell Direct. 

If you prefer, you can also change the personal details we hold by contacting our customer services team using the address or phone number below

## 12\. How we can make changes to this privacy policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time so you may want to check it each time you give us personal information or look at or change your personal details on our websites.

  


## 13\. What privacy organisations we belong to
