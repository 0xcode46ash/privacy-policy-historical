Whenever you give us your personal information, legally we have to use it in accordance with the terms of various privacy laws, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (we refer to these laws in this privacy policy as the ‘privacy laws’).

**a. When you use our websites**

When you give us information while using our websites, we will use it for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, on the data entry forms, in any relevant terms or conditions and on pages or emails which link to the data entry forms.

**b. When you use our Keyword Search Tool**

Our Keyword Search Tool allows you to search for keywords being used to find businesses on Yell.com and the number of searches being made against different keywords. When you use our Keyword Search Tool, we will store your email address and will use this information to identify any activities that are prohibited under our [online services conditions of use](https://www.yell.com/legal/). We collect this information from everyone that uses the Keyword Search Tool.

**c. Your browsing activity on Yell.com**

If you use Yell.com, your computer will store up to 5 of your last searches using cookies. We will also save the location you searched for (such as the postcode or geographic area). This lets you do the same search next time you use Yell.com or search for other types of business without having to re-enter the location every time. This information is stored only on your computer. We also collect information on your activity while you use Yell.com, such as:

  * your IP address (this is a unique 12 digit number used by programs on the internet to recognise and communicate with your computer);
  * the type of browser you use (a browser is the program you use to look at websites, such as Internet Explorer, Firefox or Safari);
  * the times when you access the site and for how long; and
  * your referring URL (the site you come from to reach our website).



This information does not allow us to identify you. We collect it from lots of visitors to our websites and analyse it. This lets us build up a picture of how people use our websites. This helps us improve the services we offer.

We may also give anonymous statistics about users to other, reputable organisations, but the information we provide will not include details that would allow these organisations to identify you.

For more information on our use of cookies please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.yell.com/legal/cookie-policy/).

**d. Customisation of our online services and advert targeting**

We may use the information you give us about yourself when you register on or for our online services, or the information we collect via cookies when you use our online services to build up a picture of your interests. We may then use this information to try to make sure that when you visit our websites or use our online services, you don’t miss offers and information that might interest you. This is called advert targeting or interest based advertising. For more information on how to reject targeted advertising or interest based advertising cookies, please read our [Cookie Policy](https://www.yell.com/legal/cookie-policy/).

  * target the adverts or offers, such as banners, on our online services and on the websites and other online services of other organisations; and
  * track the use of our internet banner adverts and other links from our marketing partners’ websites to our websites.



For these purposes, we and the other organisations we use keep information on the path you take to get to our online services and on some of the pages you visit or use through our online services, using cookies, web beacons and other on-device storage. You cannot be personally identified from the information that we or these other organisations collect.
