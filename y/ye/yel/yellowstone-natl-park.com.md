Please read the complete Policy below and [_contact us_](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com) with any questions. If you are not comfortable with this Policy, do not provide us with any personal information. By using this website or service, you expressly accept this Policy and consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Policy, including without limitation its transfer to and storage on our servers in the United States or elsewhere in the world.

WE MAY MODIFY OUR POLICY AT ANY TIME. NON-MATERIAL CHANGES AND CLARIFICATIONS WILL TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY; MATERIAL CHANGES WILL TAKE EFFECT 30 DAYS AFTER PROVIDING NOTICE VIA THIS WEBSITE OR THE EMAIL ADDRESS WE HAVE ON FILE FOR YOU. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO KEEP YOURSELF UP-TO-DATE BY CHECKING THIS POLICY AT LEAST EVERY 30 DAYS. THE LATEST MODIFICATION DATE WILL BE DISPLAYED AT THE TOP OF THE POLICY.

**OUR COMMITMENT**

This Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use and safeguard the personal information you provide to us and to assist you in making informed decisions when using our sites and our products and services offered through our sites. Demand Media is committed to industry self-regulation and strives to assure disclosure of our privacy practices to make our data practices transparent for our users. Realizing that each user has specific concerns and needs, we also seek to give you ways to manage your own level of privacy by offering you choices and by continuing to educate both you and ourselves on Internet privacy issues.

We participate in the cross-industry [_Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising_](http://aboutads.info/) , which provides our users with a mechanism to opt out of certain interest-based advertising. We also comply with [_the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework_](http://export.gov/safeharbor/) set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union countries, and in connection with that program have addressed the Safe Harbor Privacy principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.

## PRIVACY POLICY HIGHLIGHTS

## This section highlights the key takeaways from our Policy, but you should also read the full text of our Policy. 

## Personal Information: We use the term “personal information” to describe information that is associated with a specific person and is used to directly identify that person. We collect personal information about you when you voluntarily disclose or authorize the disclosure of such information to us (such as by registering an account or posting on our forums). We also use cookies and other technologies to gather information about your use of our website so that we may give you a personalized experience of our website and help us understand how users are using the website.

## Information Uses: We may use your personal information to communicate with you, run and improve our services and websites, personalize content, and ensure compliance with the law.

## Information Sharing: We do not knowingly disclose personal information that we collect from you to third parties other than our affiliated companies unless you consent to such transfer, or in the limited circumstances where such information is provided to a third party performing services for us under an obligation of confidentiality, in connection with a transfer of all or part of our business or assets, and for legal or regulatory compliance and safety purposes.

## Your Choices: You can manage your privacy by editing your information on your account, opting out of emails and certain interest-based advertising, and turning off cookies in your browser.

## PRIVACY POLICY

## 1\. INFORMATION COLLECTION

**Information You Provide To Us.**

We collect information you provide to us through the registration process on our websites or websites that use our services.  Many of our websites use Facebook Login so you can use your existing Facebook account to register. For our websites which use Facebook Login, you must explicitly authorize Facebook to share your information with us when you first login to our websites with your Facebook credentials. You should review your privacy settings on your Facebook account because those settings govern what personal information may be available to us when you access our websites. 

We may also collect any information, including personal information, you post on any public areas of our websites, like comments or forums, or that you may give us in any other way (such as through an email or survey or in connection with a promotion, sweepstakes, or contest). Please note that we are not responsible for any personal information you post in public areas. We use the term “personal information” to describe information that is associated with a specific person and is used to directly identify that person. Since information you post to public areas of our websites is not considered private information, we may also feature your posted content, such as reviews or comments, on our websites. 

We do not knowingly collect any personal information from any children under 13 or allow them to register on our websites or use our services. If you become aware that a child has provided us with personal information without her parent’s or guardian’s consent, please contact us at [privacy@demandmedia.com](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with such information, we will take steps to delete the information and terminate his/her account. We recommend that users between the ages of 13 and 17 ask their parents or other legal guardians for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet.

**Health, Medical and Dietary Information.**

On some of our websites, you may be able to submit information about your personal medical and health condition or dietary information to us (for example, through a symptom checker, weight tracker, calorie counter or other online tool). That information may be associated with your profile and therefore become personal information subject to the handling procedures set forth in this Policy. We do not share your private medical, health or dietary information with advertisers, even on an anonymous basis. However, advertisers may use cookies to track your activities on our websites and draw conclusions about your medical and health condition or dietary preferences based on these third-party cookies to serve potentially relevant advertisements. Also, to the extent you include any medical, health or dietary information in public areas of our website, such information will not be considered private information.

**Other Information We Collect From You.**

In addition to the information you provide to us by registering an account or posting content on our websites, we also collect information through the use of cookies and pixel tags. This information helps us personalize content and advertisements for users to enhance their experience on our websites.

**Cookies.**

When you visit our websites, we may send one or more "cookies" – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser to help you log in faster and enhance your navigation through the sites. We use persistent, identifying cookies to remember your information, such as your preferences, login information, and previously read articles. Our cookies do not collect personal information that you provide during the account registration process, but they do collect other information such as the following:

·         Your computer's IP address and information about its operating system or platform (Mac, Windows XP, etc.), browser type, and browser language setting;

·         URL of the last webpage you visited before arriving at our websites;

·         The date and time you access our websites and pages you visit; 

·         Demographic and other non-personally identifiable profile information about you; 

·         Your activity on our websites (such as your clicks, pages viewed, comments, search results selected, etc.); and

·         Information to combat fraud or misuse.

For more information about cookies and how to manage them, please see the section below labeled _Your Privacy Choices_.

**Pixel Tags.**

Also known as a web beacon or clear GIF, a pixel tag is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email). We may use pixel tags to measure the number of clicks on articles or advertisements. Our pixel tags do not record any user activity outside of the Demand Media network of websites and are not used to collect any personal information. Please note the next section regarding the use of pixel tags by third parties.

**Information Collected by Third Parties** **.**

Our websites include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third party businesses. We do not provide any personal information to these advertisers, third-party websites, or other businesses. However, we may sometimes mutually share non-personally identifiable (e.g., demographic) information to facilitate delivery of relevant advertisements. These third-party advertisers, or advertising networks or agencies working on their behalf, use cookies and pixel tags to, for example, personalize or optimize advertising content and to measure the effectiveness of their ads. These practices are known as interest-based or online behavioral advertising. We do not have access to or control over cookies or other technologies that these third parties may use, and the information practices of these third parties are covered by their privacy policies, not ours. Most advertisers provide an opt-out mechanism for interest-based advertising. For more information on opting out, please see the section below labeled _Your Privacy Choices_.

Similarly, if you click a link to visit another website or use the third-party referral service available on some of our websites, you will be subject to that website or provider’s privacy policy. This Policy only applies to information collected on this Demand Media website or through a Demand Media service.

You may also be asked to provide personal information or permit the transfer to a third party in connection with promotions, sweepstakes or contests we host. If you are not willing to share the information with such third parties, do not participate in such promotions, sweepstakes or contests. 

## 2\. HOW WE USE, SHARE AND MAINTAIN YOUR INFORMATION

**Information Uses.**

We use your personal information to respond to your requests, personalize content and advertisements, administer our websites, communicate with registered users, enforce our rights and the rights of third parties, and investigate and ensure compliance with our Terms of Use and applicable law. We use non-personal information (such as demographic information, anonymous usage data, IP address, web browser information, referring/exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, etc.) to help us understand how our users are using our websites and in turn make our websites more useful to you. 

**Information Sharing.**

We share your personal information if authorized by you or in the following limited instances:

·         **Third Party Services**. We use outside vendors and services to help us better understand how users interact with our websites, and to provide services to us or to you on our behalf. These third parties may have access to your personal information for use solely in connection with these authorized business activities. 

·         **Business Transfer**. We may transfer your personal information to a third party if we or any of our affiliates are involved in a corporate restructuring (e.g., a sale, merger, or other transfer of assets). 

·         **Affiliates**. We may share personal information with our corporate affiliates (see www.demandmedia.com for our major affiliates). Any use of your information by our corporate affiliates is subject to this Policy or another policy no less protective of your privacy. Conversely, we may obtain information about you from our corporate affiliates.

·         **Compliance and Safety**. We may disclose personal information when we believe disclosure is necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity or to protect the safety, rights, or property of us, our users, or others. We may also disclose personal information in response to a civil or criminal subpoena or other legal process.

**Information Retention**.

We retain information for as long as required, allowed or we believe it useful, but do not undertake retention obligations. We may dispose of information without notice, unless the law specifically requires otherwise. You must keep your own, separate back-up records. If you choose to permanently delete personal information (such as health-related information) from your account, back-up copies may exist for a short time in our databases .

**Information Security.**

On our side, we have physical, electronic, and managerial procedures in place to help safeguard your information. However, neither people nor security systems, even encryption systems, are foolproof. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If the law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, intentional misconduct will be the standard used to measure our compliance with that duty.

On your side, YOU MUST DO WHAT YOU REASONABLY CAN TO ENSURE THE SECURITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION. You should protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer and sign off when finished if you are using a shared computer. We will not ask for passwords in an email, so if you get such a request, assume it is fraudulent. We also advise you not to disclose any information in public areas of our websites that you do not wish to share, as it can be viewed and possibly used by others.

## 3\. YOUR PRIVACY CHOICES

We want to highlight the ways you can take control of your privacy at Demand Media. We urge you to explore these options and choose the level of privacy at which you are most comfortable. You can choose your privacy preferences at any time by following the links below.

**Account Preferences**.

If you are on a site that supports user registration, you can edit your account settings and information at the point of sign-in for each respective website. You also can delete your account if you choose. If you use your existing Facebook account to sign-in via Facebook Login, you should review your Facebook privacy settings, which govern what information we collect when you access our websites.

**Ad Choices Opt Out**.

While Demand Media cannot directly control the practices of third party interest-based advertisers, we have committed to using the Evidon assurance service to comply with the cross-industry [_Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising_](http://aboutads.info/). When you click on the Ad Choices icon at the bottom of the pages of our websites, you will be able to see a list of companies collecting data on the site and opt out of these by following the appropriate links.

**Marketing Preferences**.

Users can also unsubscribe from our newsletters or opt out of receiving emails (such as friend requests, daily messages, or promotional emails) by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email or newsletter. However, occasionally we may need to send you customary business communications such as website and administrative notices and confirmation emails, which you may not opt out of.

**Cookies**.

## You can follow your browser’s instructions to remove cookies at any time. However, please be aware that if cookies are disabled or removed, our websites may not function or appear as designed.

## 4\. ADDITIONAL TERMS

**Identity Theft**.

If you believe that you are a victim of identity theft entitled by law to request information from us, contact us at our Legal Notice address below and we will let you know what additional information you must provide to us. 

**Notice Required by Law**.

Where permitted by law, if we are required to disclose or provide notice of invasion of certain security systems, we will do so by email to the most current email address you have provided us.

**California Privacy Rights**.

Residents of California who have an established business relationship with us may obtain certain information about the categories of personal information we have shared with third parties, as well as the names and addresses of those third parties and examples of the types of services and products they market. To request a copy of this information disclosure, email us at [privacy@demandmedia.com](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com) and we will respond within 30 days.

**European Union Citizens**.

We comply with the U.S-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. We have disclosed our privacy practices regarding notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. Click _here_ ([http://www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor)) to learn more about the Safe Harbor program and view our certification. In line with the Safe Harbor Principles, we have also committed to referring unresolved privacy complaints to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU Safe Harbor, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB). See below for BBB’s contact information. Please note that your personal information may be transferred outside of the European Economic Area to us for processing. Your use of the site constitutes your express and informed consent to any such data transfer and processing. 

**Dispute Resolution**.

If you have any questions or concerns about this Policy, first contact us at [privacy@demandmedia.com](mailto:privacy@demandmedia.com) and we will do our best to answer your questions and resolve your concerns in a timely and professional manner. But in the unfortunate and unlikely event that we are unable do so, we work with the Council of Better Business Bureaus (BBB) as an independent dispute resolution provider. You can contact BBB and follow their guidelines for initiating dispute resolution procedures _here_ ([www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp](http://www.bbbonline.org/consumer/complaint.asp)), by phone at 703-276-0100, or by mail at Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., 4200 Wilson Boulevard, Suite 800, Arlington, VA 22203

European Union citizens with unresolved privacy concerns may also email BBB at [eusafeharbor@council.bbb.org](mailto:eusafeharbor@council.bbb.org) or direct your mail to Council of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., BBB EU Safe Harbor at the address listed above.

In the remote event that any dispute is not resolved as set forth above, any claim or controversy at law or equity that arises out of this Policy, the Terms of Use, this Demand Media website or any products or services offered on this Demand Media website (each a “Claim”) shall be resolved through binding arbitration. In such cases, the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (including without limitation the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes, if applicable), the arbitrator(s) conduct the arbitration in the English language and shall apply California law consistent with the Federal Arbitration Act and applicable statutes of limitations and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over such matters. The arbitrator(s), and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising under or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Policy, including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Policy is void or voidable.  Any Claim shall be arbitrated or litigated, as the case may be, on an individual basis and shall not be consolidated with any Claim of any other party whether through class action proceedings, class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

Alternatively, at Demand Media’s option, a Claim involving infringement of any of Demand Media intellectual property rights and Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Los Angeles County, California.
