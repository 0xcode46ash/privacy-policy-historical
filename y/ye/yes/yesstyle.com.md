# YESSTYLE: Customer Support - Privacy & Security

YesStyle is committed to protecting your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read this privacy policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our website (including its subdomains) or by purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this privacy policy. Please check back frequently, as this privacy policy may change from time to time. 

**How We Protect Your Information**

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures on our website.

When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorised access. 

YesStyle cannot be and is not responsible for unauthorised access to information by hackers or others who have obtained such access through illegal measures.

“Phishing” is a scam designed to steal your personal information. If you receive an e-mail that looks like it might be from YesStyle asking for your personal information, do not respond. YesStyle would not request your password, user name, credit card information, or other personal information through e-mail.

**How We Share Your Information**

Except as described in this privacy policy, YesStyle will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or under the following limited circumstances.

_Within Our Corporate Group_

YesStyle may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.

_Legal Requirements and Protection of Our Company and Others_

YesStyle may also share your personal information for the following limited purposes:

 _Business Transfers_

If YesStyle is acquired by or merges with another company, YesStyle may transfer personal information to that company (including transfers made as part of insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings). In such an event, YesStyle will notify you before your personal data is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy.

_Service Providers_

YesStyle may from time to time share the information we collect from and about you with other third-parties that provide support services to us, or that help us market our products and services. Examples are shipping vendors, billing and refund vendors, payment card processors, promoters and administrators of sweepstakes, contests, giveaways and promotions, and companies that help us improve our product and service offerings and our websites. These companies may need information about you in order to perform their functions. These companies are not authorised to use the information we share with them for any other purpose. In some cases YesStyle and third-party service providers may share tracking information, including your IP address, and YesStyle may provide information about your order to the website that has referred you to YesStyle (and the referral network utilised by such website), to facilitate calculation of any commissions payable by YesStyle.

YesStyle may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. A website traffic and user behavior auditing system operated by Google Analytics is being used on this website. Please see the [Google Analytics website](http://www.google.com/analytics) for information about Google Analytics, the Google Analytics auditing system, and the Google Analytics' [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/privacy.html).

The “Settings,” “Privacy” or other features on most browsers will enable you to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and to disable cookies altogether. If you have set your browser to reject cookies, you can still use our site, although you may need to re-enter information that would normally be obtained from the cookie.  


_Third-Party Cookies  
_  
YesStyle allows third parties that provide support services to us, or that help us market our products and services, to collect certain anonymous technical information (such as clickstream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, MAC address, cookie and session ID, and IP address) when you visit our website and to use that information to serve ads for YesStyle when you visit certain other websites. These third parties typically use a cookie to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, visit the [National Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the [Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising](http://www.aboutads.info/).

Though YesStyle encourages anyone who uses cookies to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, it is not responsible for cookies placed by third parties.

**Links to Other Websites**

The YesStyle.com website may have buttons, plugins and log-in interfaces from sites operated by third parties, as well as links and other connections to those sites. We refer to these buttons, plugins, login interfaces, links and other connections as “Links.” Links may include content from third-party sites that is framed within our website, such as the “Find us on Facebook” social plugin. If you click on a Link or input information in a framed Link on our site, those third parties may receive information about you. As a result, you may wish to review the privacy policies of those third parties to understand how such information is collected and used.

If you click on or input information through certain Links on our website, we may have access to information related to your account with third–party site. This may include your profile information and privacy settings for that site.

While YesStyle encourages third parties with Links on our site to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, we are not responsible for the actions of those parties, the content of their websites or any products or services they may offer.
