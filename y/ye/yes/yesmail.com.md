# Yesmail - Privacy

  
Your privacy on the Internet is important to Yesmail™. As part of the operation of Yesmail, certain pieces of information are gathered about Yesmail Members. Below are explanations regarding the types of information collected, what is done with it, and how to correct or change the information. 

What Information is Collected

As part of the Yesmail Member registration process, the prospective member is asked to provide an email address and interest category selections. The prospective member, at their option, may voluntarily provide additional information, including personal, geographic and demographic information. In addition to the information provided by members, Yesmail may also collect information about Yesmail Members from third party sources. Furthermore, Yesmail monitors incoming and outgoing Web site traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer its Web site. Yesmail also uses this data to assemble broad demographic information about its members in general. The purpose of this data collection is to ensure that Yesmail Members receive only the most relevant, targeted offers and information from Yesmail. 

Yesmail uses "contact us" forms as a way for clients, potential clients and members to communicate with Yesmail. Yesmail collects the information supplied by the sender of the "contact us" form in order to establish and maintain relationships with clients, potential clients and members. Yesmail also uses email links located on various pages of the Yesmail Web site to allow you to contact Yesmail with questions or comments you may have. Yesmail welcomes these email communications and makes efforts to respond to these communications where appropriate. Email communications and the ideas sent to Yesmail in these email communications become the property of Yesmail. Yesmail uses the email communications to evaluate and improve its services and Web site. Yesmail also may save these email communications for future reference or use. 

In an attempt to customize the Yesmail service and provide members with the information they may be most interested in, Yesmail also conducts internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior based upon information members provide directly to Yesmail and information that Yesmail may collect from third party sources and/or through the use of “cookies” (see below). Yesmail may combine or otherwise overlay some or all of the foregoing information to build profiles about Yesmail Members, which may be individual specific or in aggregate form. By becoming a Yesmail Member, you consent to Yesmail employing the foregoing techniques in its continuing efforts to better serve its members by providing them with the information in which they may be most interested. Yesmail does not use information about its members for any purposes unrelated to the services offered by Yesmail. 

As discussed above, Yesmail may, from time to time, obtain information about its members from third party sources. In addition, Yesmail may, from time to time, assist third parties in developing, implementing and monitoring advertising campaigns using data owned or supplied by the third party. Please be aware that this Privacy Policy does not cover the conduct or practices of these third party sources. However, Yesmail will treat information that it receives from third party sources according to the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

The Use of Cookies

As an important and necessary part of providing customizable and personalized services to its members, Yesmail uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about members. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a member’s browser from a Web server and stored on a member’s computer hard drive. Areas of Yesmail’s Web site where members are prompted to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. Cookies are also used to help Yesmail track the response to messages sent to members on behalf of marketers so that Yesmail can monitor and report campaign results to the marketer and track response history. With respect to cookies, you have a choice. By modifying your browser preferences, you have the choice to accept all cookies, to be notified when a cookie is set, or to reject all cookies. If you choose to reject all cookies, you will be unable to use those Yesmail services that require the use of cookies in order to participate. 

Children’s Online Privacy Protection

The safety of children is important to us. Yesmail’s Web site is a general audience site and is not directed to children under the age of 13. Similarly, Yesmail’s services are not directed to nor intended for anyone under the age of 13. Yesmail will not knowingly accept members who are under the age of 13 years nor will it knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable information from or about anyone under the age of 13 years. Accordingly, when registering to become a Yesmail Member, the new member must certify that they are not under the age of 13. Yesmail relies on the truthfulness of this certification when accepting new members. In the event that Yesmail receives information that establishes that a member is under the age of 13 years, Yesmail reserves the right, which it will exercise, to terminate that member's membership. Yesmail will also delete all information in its databases about that terminated member. 

If you believe Yesmail has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us at the address listed below.

Confidentiality

Yesmail will not provide personally identifiable information of a Yesmail Member to third parties except as noted under “Limits of Confidentiality.” Personally identifiable information means the member’s name, residence address, email address, social security number or other information from which the member’s identity may be reasonably ascertained. Yesmail uses proprietary technologies to preserve the anonymity of members while matching the member’s interests with targeted information sent via email. Yesmail will under no circumstance knowingly reveal any member’s identity to marketers. It is solely at a Yesmail Member’s discretion if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after visiting its Web site or otherwise. 

Limits of Confidentiality

As part of its day-to-day business activities, Yesmail must disclose certain aggregate level information about Yesmail Members to certain third parties; principally, (1) Yesmail’s Network Partners, and (2) Marketers who use Yesmail’s network. Below is the information and circumstances under which Yesmail may be required to disclose information to third parties. 

(1) Network Partners: When a Yesmail Member registers through the Web site of a Network Partner, Yesmail is obligated to disclose to that particular Network Partner the information submitted by the Yesmail Member during the registration process. In addition to the foregoing information, Yesmail may also disclose aggregate level information to the Network Partner about Yesmail Members who registered through that particular Network Partner’s site. Such aggregate information may include, for example, the number of individuals who registered through the Network Partner’s site; the turnover rate of Yesmail Members who have registered through the Network Partner’s site; with respect to any particular campaign, the response rates of the Yesmail Members who registered through the Network Partner’s site; and statistics on the interest categories selected by the Yesmail Members who have registered through the Network Partner’s site. Subject to the exceptions discussed below, Yesmail will not knowingly disclose any personally identifiable information about a Yesmail Member to a Network Partner unless such personally identifiable information was provided during the registration process through the Network Partner’s Web site. 

(2) Marketers: Yesmail will disclose aggregate level information about Yesmail Members to marketers as reasonably necessary to explain the services that Yesmail can offer, to report on the advertising campaigns that Yesmail undertakes for any particular marketer, and/or to implement and explain campaign strategies. Subject to the exceptions discussed below, Yesmail will not knowingly disclose any personally identifiable information about a Yesmail Member to a marketer. 

Due to the existing legal, regulatory and security environment, Yesmail may be required, under certain circumstances, to disclose aggregate level and/or personally identifiable information about its members. Yesmail will use its best efforts to limit such disclosure to the following: where Yesmail believes in good faith that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena or other legal process; where reasonably required to do so in order to maintain, update or otherwise implement Yesmail’s data security measures, equipment, technical operations and the like; or where reasonably necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against persons or entities to preserve and/or enforce Yesmail’s rights. 

Use of Information

Yesmail uses member information to deliver the Yesmail services. Thus, member information is used by Yesmail in identifying information that may be of interest to its members. A member's email address will be used by Yesmail to contact that member about member-selected interests. Yesmail also uses member information to monitor, interpret, analyze and report campaign results. Yesmail does not use member information for purposes unrelated to the services offered by Yesmail. 

Protection of Member Information

Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of the identity, preferences and other information it has collected about individual members and will never knowingly allow access to this information to anyone outside Yesmail other than to the member or as described above under the heading Limits of Confidentiality. Yesmail has made a substantial investment in its server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the Yesmail Network™, including the confidentiality of information collected about Yesmail Members. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. 

You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your Yesmail user name and password are confidential and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone. Unfortunately, neither Yesmail network nor data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect member information, Yesmail cannot ensure or warrant the security of member information. Thus, any information a member transmits to us is done so at the member’s own risk. Once we receive member information, Yesmail undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this information consistent with this Policy. 

Reviewing or Modifying Member Information or Terminating Membership

A Yesmail Member may choose at any time to review, modify or permanently remove all information stored by Yesmail about that member by accessing their account directly at [my.Yesmail.com](http://my.yesmail.com/). A Yesmail Member can also send an email to subs@my.Yesmail.com to terminate the account. If a member terminates their membership, the past member will no longer receive any communications from Yesmail. Yesmail will not sell, rent, or otherwise use the information about former members. 

Policy Changes

The foregoing policy is effective as of June 2000. Yesmail reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of Yesmail’s services following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes. Yesmail will take reasonable measures to notify you if there is a material change in our privacy practices with respect to use of the information you have provided to Yesmail. Yesmail will conspicuously post these changes in our Privacy Policy. Yesmail also will post a message on the home page of its Web site that states that the Privacy Policy has been changed, and will provide a link to the Privacy Policy. These postings will occur on Yesmail’s Web site at least 30 days prior to any material change. For more information, see our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603124746id_/http%3A//yesmail.com/terms.asp) of service.
