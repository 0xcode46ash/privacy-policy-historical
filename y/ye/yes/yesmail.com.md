# About The YesMail Network

|  | 

  
**Privacy** [](https://www.truste.org/validate/3213)   


**YesMail** is a powerful concept. The true value of this concept, however, is your privacy and your trust in our ability to ensure your privacy, as members, marketers, and network partners. We created the following privacy policy guidelines with a fundamental respect for your right to privacy. 

**_TRUSTe Licensee_**  
yesmail.com is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. This statement discloses the privacy practices for yesmail.com. When you visit a Web site displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, you can expect to be notified of: What personally identifiable information of yours is collected; What organization is collecting the information; How the information is used; With whom the information may be shared; What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information; What kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under the company's control; and How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@yesmail.com](mailto:privacy@yesmail.com). If the Web site has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact TRUSTe (<http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html>). 

**_BBBOnLine Privacy Program Participant_**  
We also participate in the Council of Better Business Bureaus' BBBOnLine Privacy Program, and comply with all the BBBOnLine Privacy standards. Further information about this program is available at [http://www.bbbonline.org](http://www.bbbonline.org/). 

**_What Information is Collected_**  
YesMail members will provide an email address and interest category selection. At their option they may also provide additional personal, geographic and demographic information such as zip code, gender, age, and education. YesMail marketers and network partners will provide company information via online contact forms such as company name, contact person, phone, fax, email, etc. YesMail will never knowingly collect or maintain information about anyone under the age of 13.

**_Confidentiality_**  
YesMail does not provide individually identifiable information to third parties except as noted under “Limits of Confidentiality”. YesMail uses proprietary technologies to preserve the anonymity of **members** while matching their interests with targeted information sent via email. YesMail will under no circumstance reveal any member’s identity to marketers. It is solely at a YesMail member’s discretion if he or she chooses to provide personally identifiable information to a marketer by making a purchase, requesting additional information, or communicating directly with the company or organization after visiting its web site. 

Contact information provided by **marketers** and **network partners** is never provided to third parties except as noted under “Limits of Confidentiality”. 

**_Limits of Confidentiality_**  
Due to the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we may be forced to disclose individually identifiable information to third parties. We will use our best efforts to limit disclosure to only these circumstances where necessary by contract, legal process, or the technical operation of the service. 

**_Use of Information_**  
A YesMail member’s email address will only be used by YesMail to periodically contact that member about member-selected interests. A marketer’s or network partner’s contact and company information will only be used in response to a direct inquiry about YesMail services. 

YesMail uses incoming and outgoing website traffic data to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our website. We also use it to gather broad demographic information about our users in general. We may combine demographic information supplied by a user at registration time with site usage data to provide profiles, in aggregate form, about our users and their preferences as it relates to the YesMail Network. 

As part of providing customizable and personalized services, YesMail uses cookies to store and sometimes track information about members. A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to a member’s browser from a Web server and stored on a member’s computer hard drive. Areas of YesMail sites where members are prompted to login or that are customizable require acceptance of cookies. Cookies are also used to help us track the response to messages sent to members on behalf of marketers so that we can report campaign results to the marketer and track response history. 

**_Security Technology_**  
YesMail has made a substantial investment in the latest server, database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information assets of the YesMail Network. These technologies are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and protocol. All data resides in a tightly controlled, secure data center. These investments mean that information about the identity and preferences of individual members is never accessible to anyone outside YesMail. 

**_Review/Modify/Terminate Membership_**  
YesMail members may choose at any time to review, modify or permanently remove all contact and interest information stored by YesMail by accessing their account directly at [http://my.yesmail.com](http://my.yesmail.com/).Once removed from the network, a past member will no longer receive any communications from YesMail. YesMail will never sell, rent, or otherwise use the contact information of former members. 

For more information see our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/web/20000304215951id_/http%3A//www.yesmail.com/terms.asp) of service.
