If you are ordering for the first time we will also require you to choose a username and password so that we can create your account. When you sell artwork on Customdropshipping .com we may also ask for your PayPal account so that we may pay your commission for any items sold.

They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
