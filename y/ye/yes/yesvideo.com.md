# YesDVD Transfer Service: Videotape to DVD

We at YesVideo respect your right to privacy and have a firm commitment to safeguarding our customers' personal information. YesVideo will not rent, sell, or share any information regarding any individual customer (such as name, address, e-mail address or credit cards numbers) to any third party other than under the terms outlined in this privacy statement. 

YesVideo collects information from you at several different points on our Web site. By using our services, you consent to the collection and use of information as described below. If YesVideo changes its privacy practices, those changes will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how it used, and under what circumstances (if any) it is disclosed. 

YesVideo may disclose information it has collected from any member of the YesVideo Site ("Member") and/or content any Member has made available on the YesVideo Site when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of YesVideo or others. 

**Third Party Service Providers**   
YesVideo may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist in providing our services to you, including but not limited to: third parties that assist with the administration of newsletters or contests or that help YesVideo understand survey results; third parties that track the number of visitors to the YesVideo site that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party Web sites and those visitors' activities on the YesVideo site; vendors enlisted to fulfill your product order (excluding credit card information). 

**Cookies**   
YesVideo's cookies do not contain any personal information about you. They contain a unique identifier that on YesVideo can match up with your personal information, which allows you to use member-related features on the YesVideo site. YesVideo cookies expire when you log off our site, or after 30 minutes of inactivity on the YesVideo site. 

**IP Address**   
YesVideo analyzes IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. YesVideo does not link IP addresses to your computer's User ID. If you entered the YesVideo Site by clicking a link or promotion on another Web site (including a YesVideo co-branded portion of another Web site), YesVideo will store the ID of that affiliate site in a YesVideo database along with your computer's User ID. YesVideo does this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. YesVideo may also use this information in conjunction with your activities on the YesVideo site to help identify what offers and services may be of interest to you. 

**Sharing**   
YesVideo may share aggregated demographic information with partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

**Surveys & Contests**   
Periodically, the YesVideo site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. 

**Security**   
This Web site takes every precaution to protect user information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected. 

When the registration/order form asks you to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as the order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked or open when you are just 'surfing.' 

If you have any questions about the security at this Web site, please email [support@yesvideo.com ](mailto:support@yesvideo.com). 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**   
If your personally identifiable information changes (such as your ZIP code), YesVideo will endeavor to provide a way to correct or update your personal data. This can usually be done by emailing YesVideo Customer Service at support@yesvideo.com. 

**Choice/Opt-out**   
You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to at the point where we ask for the information. For example, the order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who buy products or services from YesVideo, and want to receive marketing materials, surveys or other e-mail communication, can choose not to include their e-mail address in our lists. Users who no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional materials via email may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to the email with unsubscribe in the subject line or by sending an email to [support@yesvideo.com ](mailto:support@yesvideo.com).
