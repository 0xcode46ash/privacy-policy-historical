When you visit our Web site, YesAsia.com collects your IP address, which we use to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, and to improve our products and services. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. 

To receive our Web site's biweekly newsletter, you only need to leave us your e-mail address. But to order from us, you must set up a YesAsia.com account, by providing us your email address and a chosen password (your "Account Information"). When you place an order with us, we will also collect your name, shipping address, telephone number, credit card number, billing address, and card expiration date (your "Order Information"). This information is necessary for us to process your order and to notify you of your order status. We may use your Account Information and Order Information to occasionally notify you about important changes to the Web site, new YesAsia.com features, or special YesAsia.com offers that you may find useful. If you have purchased from our site or subscribed to one of our newsletters, we may occasionally update you on special promotions via email . We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes. If you choose not to receive updates when you enter a contest or sweepstakes, it will not affect your chances of winning. 

If you would rather not receive email from us, simply visit the Preferences section of My Account, select the "unsubscribe" "radio" button and click "Update Preferences" to unsubscribe to our newsletter.

This Web site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control. When you place orders or access your account information, we use a secure server. The secure server layer (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. All of the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. 

YesAsia.com will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to (1) comply with the law or with legal process, (2) protect and defend our rights and property, (3) protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the YesAsia.com Web site, or (4) protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public. 

YesAsia.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related Web site information to third parties, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Put simply, we will not tell our business partners that you bought a particular product, but we may tell them how many customers in certain demographic groups bought certain products.

At YesAsia.com, we understand that children's privacy is important. Except in connection with surveys and contests, we do not monitor the age of our user audience. However, if you are under age 13, you should not submit personal identifying information to YesAsia.com without the consent of your parent or guardian. If you are a parent and want to limit your children's access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware, software and filtering devices. If you are interested in learning about these protections, information is available at <http://www.worldvillage.com/wv/school/html/control.htm> and other similar sites.
