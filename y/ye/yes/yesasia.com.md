YesAsia.com's Privacy Policy

YesAsia.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read this policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our website or by purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this policy. Please check back frequently, as this policy may change from time to time.

What information we collect and how we use it

When you visit our website, YesAsia.com collects your IP address, which we use to improve our products and services as well as to help us administer our website and diagnose problems that may occur with our server. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you.

To receive our website's newsletters and/or periodic emails with special offers, you only need to leave your email address with us. However, to order from us, you must set up a YesAsia.com account by providing us with your email address and a chosen password. These constitute your "Account Information". Account Information also includes any information that you may provide to us in response to customer surveys. 

When you place an order with us, we will also collect your name, shipping address, and telephone number, as well as credit card number, billing address, and card expiration date, if applicable. This information constitues your "Order Information". Order Information is necessary for us both to process your order and notify you of your order status. Order Information also includes any information that you provide us in connection with an order that you later cancel or that is not completed for any reason.

We may use your Account Information and Order Information to occasionally notify you about important changes to the website, new YesAsia.com features, special YesAsia.com offers that you may find useful, or offers from companies with whom we have business relationships. 

If you have purchased from our site or subscribe to one of our newsletters, you may periodically receive special promotions from us via email. We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes. Choosing not to receive updates when you enter a contest or sweepstakes will not affect your chances of winning.

If you would prefer not to receive email newsletters or email messages with special offers from us, simply visit the "Preferences" section of "My Account". From here, select "Newsletter Subscriptions" and/or "Personalized Email Reminders and Special Offer Email Subscriptions," indicate which newsletters or email reminders you wish to unsubscribe from then click the "Update" button.

How we protect your information

To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures at this website.

When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed.

All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access.

YesAsia.com will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure or the disclosure is necessary to:

(1) Comply with the law or with legal process  
(2) Protect and defend our rights and property  
(3) Protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the YesAsia.com website, or   
(4) Protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public.

If YesAsia.com is acquired by or merges with another company, YesAsia.com may transfer personal information to that company. In such an event, YesAsia.com will notify you before your personal data is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy.

YesAsia.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. Put simply, while we will not tell our business partners that a particular individual bought a particular product, we may tell them how many customers within certain demographic groups bought certain products.

Making changes to your information

You may change your personal information on file with YesAsia.com at any time. To do this, simply visit the "Account Management" section of "My Account". From here, choose "Change your Sign In and personal information", "Manage Shipping Addresses in your address book", and/or "View and change your Credit Card Profiles". Enter the changes to the information as desired, and then click the "Update", "Edit", or "Delete", button, as appropriate.

The YesAsia.com website contains links to other sites, operated by third parties that we believe may be of interest to you. While YesAsia.com encourages third parties to follow appropriate privacy standards and policies, it is not responsible for the actions of those parties, the content of their websites or any products or services they may offer.

Children's privacy online

At YesAsia.com, we believe that the privacy of children is important.

We do not monitor the age of our user audience except in connection with surveys and contests, and except for age data optionally provided by users who wish to customize their account preferences, However, visitors and users under the age of thirteen (13) should not submit personal identifying information to YesAsia.com without the consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s).
