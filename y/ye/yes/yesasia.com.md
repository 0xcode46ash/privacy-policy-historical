# YESASIA: Customer Support - Privacy & Security - YesAsia.com's Privacy Policy - North America Site

** **

Last Updated: Nov. 5, 2008

YesAsia.com is committed to protecting your privacy. We hope that you will take the time to read this policy, which explains what information we collect from you and how we use that information. By using our website or by purchasing products or services from us, you agree to be bound by this policy. Please check back frequently, as this policy may change from time to time. 

_What information we collect and how we use it_  
When you visit our website, YesAsia.com collects your IP address, which we use to improve our products and services as well as to help us administer our website and diagnose technical problems. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information that does not personally identify you. To receive our website's newsletters and/or periodic email notifications with special offers, you only need to leave your email address with us. However, to order from us, you must set up a YesAsia.com account by providing us with your name, email address and a chosen password. These constitute your "Account Information". Account Information also includes any information that you may provide to us in response to customer surveys. When you place an order with us, we will also collect your shipping address and telephone number, as well as credit card number, billing address, and card expiration date, if applicable. This information constitutes your "Order Information". Order Information is necessary for us both to process your order and notify you of your order status. Order Information also includes any information that you provide us in connection with an order that you later cancel or that is not completed for any reason. We may use your Account Information and Order Information to occasionally notify you about important changes to the website, new YesAsia.com features, special YesAsia.com offers that you may find useful, or offers from companies with whom we have business relationships. We may also contact you if you have entered one of our contests or sweepstakes, or responded to one of our surveys. Choosing not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us when you enter a contest or sweepstakes will not affect your chances of winning. If you would prefer not to receive email newsletters or email notifications from us (other than email notifications relating to order processing), simply visit the "Preferences" section of "My Account". From here, select "Newsletter Subscriptions" and/or "Personalized Email Reminders and Special Offer Email Subscriptions," indicate which newsletters or email notifications you wish to unsubscribe from, and then click the "Update" button. _How we protect your information  
_ To protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information under our control we have implemented security measures at this website.   
When you place orders or access your account information, a secure server is employed. All information you input is encrypted by the secure server layer (SSL) before it is sent to us and all the customer data we collect is similarly protected against unauthorized access. _Limited Sharing of information  
_ YesAsia.com will not share your personal information with third parties unless you have consented to the disclosure, you are a “TVB Visitor” (as defined below) or the disclosure is necessary to:   
(1) Comply with the law or with legal process, or with requests from law enforcement authorities;  
(2) Protect and defend our rights and property;  
(3) Protect our customers or users from misuse or unauthorized use of the YesAsia.com website; or   
(4) Protect the personal safety or property of our customers or the public. YesAsia.com may share your personal information with other companies in our corporate group.  Also, if YesAsia.com is acquired by or merges with another company, YesAsia.com may transfer personal information to that company. In such an event, YesAsia.com will notify you before your personal data is transferred if this information would become subject to a materially different privacy policy. If you have come to our website by clicking on a link posted on the website of TVB.com Limited, you are a “TVB Visitor,” and under a special arrangement between YesAsia.com and TVB, YesAsia may provide to TVB personal information that you provide to YesAsia.com.  This information includes your name, shipping address and e-mail address.  YesAsia.com may also inform TVB of any TVB products that you purchase on the YesAsia.com website and your order number for such products.  Please note that YesAsia.com has no control over any use of such information by TVB. For information regarding the TVB's practices with respect to personal information, please see [TVB's privacy policy](http://www.tvb.com/affairs/faq/policy/index_e.html). 

YesAsia.com may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related website information to third parties, but these statistics will not include any personally identifying information. Put simply, while we will not tell our business partners that a particular individual bought a particular product, we may, for example, tell them how many customers within certain demographic groups bought certain products. 

A website traffic and user behavior auditing system operated by Google Analytics is being used on this website. Please see the [Google Analytics website ](http://www.google.com/analytics/)for information about Google Analytics, the Google Analytics auditing system, and Google Analytics' [privacy policy](http://www.google.com/intl/en_ALL/privacy.html).

If you are a parent and want to limit your children's access to material you believe may be harmful to them, you may want to look into commercially available hardware, software and filtering devices. Relevant information can be found at <http://www.safetysurf.com/> and other similar sites.
