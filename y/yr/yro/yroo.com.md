# Privacy Policy | yroo

RETAILCOMMON Inc., the owner of yroo.com (“yroo.com,” “us” or “we”), owns and operates the yroo.com website (the “Web Site”) and the services related to or offered on the Web Site (the “Services”).

Your privacy and the respectful and responsible handling of your personal information is very important to us. The purpose of this privacy policy (the “Policy”) is to outline the types of information that may be collected about you when visiting the Web Site, how that information will be used and disclosed, and how you can control, correct and update the information.

Each visit to the Web Site or use of the Services constitutes your acknowledgement and acceptance of the Policy. Providing personal information or authorizing a third party to disclose personal information to us signifies your consent to yroo.com’s collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.

For the purposes of this Policy, “personal information” means information that can identify an individual directly or through other reasonably available means. The meaning of “personal information” shall be interpreted in a manner that conforms with the minimum requirements of applicable provincial and federal privacy legislation.

## 1\. Our Privacy Principles

Type of Personal Information Collected

The type of information we collect is linked to the purposes. For instance, when you sign up to be a Member, we may collect your name, email address, and other payment information as well as information about the products or services you view or purchase. If you are part of a referral program we keep track of who you refer and who refers you (as applicable). In addition, we sometimes host contests, so we will collect information as set forth in the contest rules.

Identifying Purposes and Obtaining Your Consent

The purposes for which we collect personal information are mostly what you would reasonably expect. Where it is not reasonably evident why we’re collecting information, we would identify the purposes for collecting your personal information at or before the time it is collected. We will not collect, use or disclose your personal information without your informed consent, unless required or permitted to do so by law.

To provide to you a few example of why we collect personal information, we collect, use and disclose personal information about you so we can:

  * maintain and manage our membership;
  * account for reward points or cash back earned under your account;
  * allocate cash back;
  * process payments; and
  * target advertisements to make the Web Site and/or Services more personal and useful to you. 



We may also use your personal information to communicate with you about new products, Services, offerings or other information we reasonably believe may be useful to you.

## 2\. Limiting Collection, Use and Disclosure of Your Personal Information

Information Gathered and Used

We collect personal information by fair and lawful means and limit collection to that information which is reasonably necessary for the purposes identified in this Policy.

The choice to provide us with your personal information, either directly or through a third party, is always yours. However, your decision to withhold particular information may limit our ability to provide you with some of our products or Services.

How your Information is Collected

Most of the personal information we collect will be done online. However, personal information may also be collected in a number of ways, including: over the phone, by mail or, yes, even by fax if necessary (and such fax machines exist). We may also collect personal information from third parties who you have authorized to disclose personal information to us (for instance, our Affiliate Stores will have information on your purchases and that information may be provided to us if necessary to audit transactions and ensure rewards are properly allocated).

We make every reasonable effort to ensure that those third parties that disclose your personal information to us have first obtained your consent. If you believe that a third party has inappropriately disclosed your personal information to us, please contact that third party directly. If the third party does not sufficiently respond to your inquiries, please let us know immediately.

Your personal information will only be used or disclosed in accordance with the purposes for which it was collected, unless you have otherwise consented and except where required or permitted by law.

Web cookies are very small text files that are stored on your computer from a webpage to keep track of information about your browsing on that Web Site. Cookies are essential to our ability to track what you’ve viewed and your purchases. We cannot offer the Services or allocate rewards or cash back without cookies being installed in your system.

In addition, through the use of web cookies, we may monitor the ads you see and the number of times you view them. The use of cookies also allows us to capture standard web traffic information, such as the time and date you visited our Web Site, your IP address, and your browser information.

Information from Social Media. If you access or log-in to the yroo Service through a social media service or connect yroo to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service. When you access the Services through social media services or when you connect a Service to social media services, you are authorizing yroo to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

In some instances, such as a legal proceeding or court order, we may also be required to disclose your personal information to authorities. Only the information specifically requested is disclosed and we take precautions to satisfy ourselves that the authorities that are making the disclosure request have legitimate grounds to do so.

Your personal information may be disclosed in situations where we are legally permitted to do so, such as in the course of employing reasonable and legal methods to enforce your rights or to investigate suspicion of unlawful activities. We may release certain personal information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of ourselves and others.

You also understand and agree that we may use your personal information and disclose your personal information to third parties in connection with the proposed or actual financing, insuring, sale, securitization, assignment or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets (including accounts) for the purposes of evaluating and/or performing the proposed transaction. These purposes may include, for example, permitting such parties to determine whether to proceed or continue with the transaction, fulfilling any reporting or audit requirements to such parties, and/or disclosing personal information as part of concluding a sale or transfer of assets. Our successors and assigns may collect, use and disclose your personal information for substantially the same purposes as those set out in this Policy. In the event the transaction does not go through, we will require, by contract, the other party or parties to the transaction not to use or disclose your personal information in any manner whatsoever for any purpose, and to return or destroy such personal information.

Personal information may also be disclosed to service providers and/or third-party contractors who we work with and/or employ on our behalf to help operate yroo.com, the Web Site and/or the Services.
