## Privacy Policy

As of 26 October 2011

#### Basic principles for processing personal data

As the operator of YieldKit, YieldKit UG is subject to the following principles regarding the protection of personal data: YieldKit collects, processes and uses personal data in compliance with the data protection laws of the Federal Republic of Germany and the data protection provisions of the European Union. YieldKit uses personal data solely to enable the use of YieldKit internet services that require registration. YieldKit will under no circumstances disclose or otherwise pass on personal data to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.  
What does YieldKit know about you, what rights do you grant to YieldKit and visitors to the YieldKit website, and what happens to your personal data? 

#### Personal data

Personal data means information, e.g. your name, e-mail address, etc. We will only collect personal data to the extent and for the purpose that you voluntarily provide us with the data, e.g. in the context of registration. 

#### Registration details

In order for YieldKit services to work, YieldKit must collect certain personal data from you as your registration details and process these during registration. This is primarily the following data:

First name, Surname  
Address  
Website  
E-Mail address  
Password

Your email address and password will under no circumstances nor at any time be visible to other YieldKit members or users of YieldKit webpages. YieldKit will under no circumstances divulge or pass on this data to third parties. 

#### Further details

Furthermore, at the time of registration or at a subsequent date you must provide certain information:  
access data for a credit account (e.g. PayPal, bank account, etc.)  
This data will under no circumstances nor at any time be visible to other YieldKit members or YieldKit website users. YieldKit will under no circumstances divulge or pass on this data to third parties. 

#### E-mails and newsletter

We send a newsletter to all YieldKit users at irregular intervals. In this newsletter YieldKit informs you about new YieldKit products, features, etc. Bills are also sent by e-mail. You can disable the receipt of the newsletter in your personal profile settings. 

#### Cookies

“Cookies” are small files that allow us to save on your PC or other end device information related specifically to you, the user, while you use YieldKit services. Cookies help us for example, to determine the frequency of use and the number of users of our webpages, as well as to make our offerings as convenient, efficient and interesting as possible for you.  
After you register, YieldKit services use “session cookies”, using which you can be identified for the duration of your visit. After the end of the session and after a certain period of inactivity, the session cookies will expire automatically.  
YieldKit services and YieldKit partners also use “permanent cookies” to record information about visitors that repeatedly access YieldKit services. The purpose using permanent cookies is to continuously improve our products and services for you. Permanent cookies do not contain any personal data. Names, IP addresses, etc. are not saved. No individual profile is created as regards your usage patterns.  
You can deactivate the storing of cookies in your browser, restrict it to certain sites, or set your browser to notify you immediately when a cookie is sent. You can also delete cookies from the hard drive of your PC at any time. However, please note that the use of YieldKit services is not possible if session cookies are rejected. 

#### Log files

Access information is stored in a log file (server log) whenever a page is viewed. This stored data set contains the following data:  
• The time, status, request made by your browser to the server, amount of data transferred, the internet page from which you arrived on the requested page (referrer), and  
• The product and version information of the browser used (user agent).  
To do this, YieldKit uses the standard “combined” log file format. However your IP address is not stored at the end of your visit to the YieldKit Web site. Subject to any legal retention requirements, users’ IP addresses should be erased or made anonymous after termination of use. In the case of anonymisation, IP addresses are changed such that the individual details as regards personal and factual circumstances can no longer or only be associated with a specific or specifiable natural person given a disproportionately large expense in time, cost and labour.  
YieldKit uses log files anonymously, i.e. without reference to or association with your person, for statistical evaluations. YieldKit can thus learn on which days and at what times the offerings of the YieldKit websites are particularly popular and what data volumes are created on YieldKit websites, for example. Using the log files, YieldKit can also detect possible errors, e.g. broken links or program errors, and thus use the log files to further develop YieldKit websites. YieldKit does not link the page views or usage data stored in the server log to individuals. YieldKit reserves the right to use data from log files if certain facts indicate sufficient suspicion that a user is using YieldKit websites and/or YieldKit services in a manner that is unlawful or in violation of the contract. This serves to protect YieldKit members and their data, as well as YieldKit websites and YieldKit services. 

#### Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”). Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how you use the site. The information generated by cookies about your use of the website will normally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will first truncate your IP address within the area of Member States of the European Union or other contracting parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will the full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. Google will use this information on behalf of the operator of this website for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage for the website operator. The IP address that your browser transmits within the scope of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google. You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also prevent the collection of data generated by cookies and related to your use of the website (including your IP address) for Google, as well as the processing of this data by Google, by downloading and installing the browser plugin available at the following link: <http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en>. 

#### Data security

We have taken appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect your personal data from loss, destruction, tampering, unauthorised access and other abuse. 

#### Information/revocation/correction

You can obtain information about your data stored by us and can ask for inaccurate data to be corrected at any time without stating reasons and free of charge. In addition, you can at any time withdraw your consent with future effect. In the event of revocation, we are obliged to immediately delete the personal data, unless mandatory statutory retention obligations preclude deletion. Both revocations and information requests can be sent informally either by mail to:  
Yieldkit GmbH, Jarrestraße 44b, 22303 Hamburg  
or by email to the electronic mailbox [privacy@yieldkit.com](mailto:privacy@yeldkit.com) at any time.
