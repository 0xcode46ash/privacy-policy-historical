Please read this policy carefully, and feel free to contact us at privacy@YieldMo.com or at the mailing address set forth below if you have any questions regarding its content. 

The YieldMo Website may link to third party websites or applications. YieldMo is not responsible for such third parties' privacy practices. Users should consult the privacy policies of such third party websites or applications to learn about such third parties' privacy practices. 

**Use of YieldMo Website**

**Log Data**

Our servers may automatically record non-personally identifiable information (" **Log Data** ") from anyone who visits the YieldMo Website. This Log Data may include the visitor's IP address, browser type, operating system and language settings, referring domain, pages visited, visit duration and submitted search terms. This data is used to monitor usage, conduct administration and troubleshooting, and assist in improvements to the YieldMo Service. We may vary and tailor the content the visitor receives in future visits to the YieldMo Website based on such visitor's preferences and activities as determined based upon such Log Data.

**Registration and Account Data**

If you register to use the YieldMo Website as an advertiser or publisher, we ask for and store information you provide such as your email, first name, last name, company name, username, address and phone number (collectively, " **Registration Data** "). After you register to use the YieldMo Website, you may set up advertising campaigns and other account parameters (" **Account Data** "). We collect and retain this information so that we can provide the YieldMo Service to you and perform internal analysis, account maintenance and billing, and so that we can offer personalized features, including varying the content you receive in future visits to the YieldMo Website based on your preferences and activities. When you update information, we usually keep a backup copy of the prior version for a reasonable period of time. 

**Combination of Log Data and Registration Data**

Log Data may be combined with a visitor's Registration Data and Account Data once the visitor has registered or subsequently logged into the YieldMo Website. The combined data is used to provide, monitor and assist in improvements to the YieldMo Service, and to customize content and advertising displayed to the user on the YieldMo Website.

**Cookies**

Use of certain features on the YieldMo Website requires that the visitor accept the use of cookies, which are small data files that the website sends to the visitor's browser for storage on such visitor's computer's hard drive. We use cookies to track activity at the YieldMo Website and better serve visitors' needs, preferences and interests as noted above. 

**End Users of the YieldMo Advertising Network**

YieldMo partners with numerous companies to provide online advertisements to end users of websites, mobile websites and applications (" **End Users** "). 

As an End User browses the Internet, he or she may visit Web pages that include references to the YieldMo Service. When this happens, an End User's browser or device may request advertisements from YieldMo's system. When YieldMo receives these requests, we may collect non-personally identifiable information about this interaction (as well as any further interaction with the advertisements provided by the YieldMo Service such as views, clicks, mouse movements, etc.) including the End User's IP address and time of request, information about the general geographical location from which an End User is viewing an advertisement, device type, and other information made available by the browser or device, such as operating system and language setting. Such non-personally identifiable information is stored on YieldMo's servers. **** The information collected may be used to provide reports to advertisers and publishers who participate in YieldMo's advertising network, to schedule, deliver and optimize advertisements, to limit the number of times a specific advertisement is presented to the same browser or device (frequency capping), to detect and eliminate fraudulent activity and to administer the YieldMo Service. YieldMo does not sell or rent information it collects about End Users. 

**Advertisers and Publishers**

We may collect and use non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information from advertisers and publishers who participate in YieldMo's advertising network, as specified under "Use of YieldMo Website" above, to provide customer support to the applicable advertiser or publisher, and to send to such party account-related information, including invoices, payments, technical notices, updates, security alerts, and support, administrative and promotional messages. 

**Legal Compliance**

We may disclose information to fulfill legal or regulatory requirements or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm. 

**Third Party Service Providers**

We retain certain third party service providers to perform functions and services for us. We may share information with these third party service providers, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and services, and only pursuant to obligations that are no less restrictive than those contained in this privacy policy. 

**Aggregate Information**

YieldMo may share aggregate and anonymous usage statistics regarding the YieldMo Service with the public or businesses with whom we work.
