**Details**

Right Media runs an online advertising exchange for our clients that enables them to buy and sell ad space on websites for online advertising.  Our clients are businesses engaged in Internet advertising - advertisers, agencies, publishers, ad networksand other technology providers. Our Yield Manager technology powers this online exchange. When ad space on a website is sold, usually to an advertiser, agency or ad network by a publisher or other ad network, the Yield Manager technology fulfills the transaction by delivering the ad to that publisher’s site. Generally, an Internet user's computer comes into contact with Right Media when a user visits a website whose publisher utilizes the Yield Manager technology, or views an ad that has been served by Yield Manager. The ads sent by the Yield Manager technology are sent from the domain ad.yieldmanager.com and through client domains that forward ads and ad requests to and from ad.yieldmanager.com. **

**Types of information we collect and how we use it**

Right Media Technology Platform

Right Media is a technology provider for our clients.  As a technology provider, we contractually prohibit our clients from sending personally identifiable information to the Yield Manager technology and require our clients to post privacy policies that comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations. 

Before the Yield Manager technology delivers an ad, the technology uses information collected from several sources to decide the best ad to display.  The information used helps the technology infer the context in which the ad will appear; resulting in a more relevant ad.  This section describes the technologies used on our clients’ websites to help deliver the most relevant ad to you:

  * Cookies are small text files that are stored within a browser.  They are accessed and recorded by the web site visited and by the companies that show ads on that site to enable them to “recognize” the same browser or user.  They are used as part of the ad serving process and also help us collect information about a user’s online interactions.  The Yield Manager cookie helps us maintain a list of ads previously delivered by the Yield Manager technology.  The cookie also stores the number of times the same ad was delivered, the number of times you have clicked on an ad served by our technology, and the number of times you have possibly engaged in a business transaction on the advertiser’s website. 
  * When an ad is served on one of our client’s websites, Right Media’s Yield Manager technology collects non-personally identifiable information such as the date and time of your visit to our client’s website, your IP address, the type of browser you are using, and the web page address that you are visiting.  This information helps our technology infer the context in which the ad will appear.  This information is saved in a log file and kept by Right Media for auditing and fraud detection purposes.
  * The Yield Manager technology responds to requests from ad tags placed on the website you are visiting.  Ad tags provide Right Media with information to determine the size and location of the ad.  In some cases, websites can also provide information about you, such as non-personally identifiable demographic information.
  * The Yield Manager technology uses web beacons (also known as clear GIFs or 1x1 pixels).  A web beacon serves a tiny graphic placed on a web site that is not visible to the user.  We allow our clients to use web beacons to measure campaign effectiveness and to optimize campaign performance.  For example, if you click through an ad to the advertiser’s website, a web beacon on the advertiser’s website can report to the Yield Manager servers what pages within the advertiser’s site that user has visited.  The advertiser can then utilize this information to measure the effectiveness of their campaign and provide more relevant advertising.  Our technology also uses pixels to allow our clients to create identify consumer segments and select the appropriate ad based on the segment.
  * The Yield Manager technology collects and stores aggregated ad delivery reporting data.  This data is used to provide our clients with campaign reporting and used for billing purposes.  A typical report includes information about the ads delivered, including the date and time of ad delivery, the websites on which the ads were shown, and statistics on user response.  A report also includes statistics about browser types, date and time of ad delivery, and inferred geography (the IP Address for the web browser is used to approximate, general geographic location).



Right Media Website   


The Right Media website collects personally-identifiable information about users only if a user voluntarily provides that information to this site.  This website also collects non-personally identifiable information to help us maximize our website performance and to improve its usefulness.  This section describes the types of information we collect about you when you interact with this web site:

  * The Right Media website uses cookies to evaluate the performance and usefulness of this site.  The information collected by cookies on this site is not combined with information from the Yield Manager cookie that is used for increasing your ad relevancy.  In addition, the Right Media cookie does not provide or link to any personally identifiable information you may have provided on this site.
  * The Right Media website collects personally identifiable information, such as a name, email address, mailing address and phone number, only in situations where you provide it on our site.  Personally identifiable information is collected on our site in the following instances: Contact Us! function, blog posts, subscription feed, forward to a friend, inquiry about adware or spyware removal, Yield Manager client, Inquiry about the Right Media Exchange, and Request for feedback.  Right Media uses the personally-identifiable information you provide to respond to your inquiries and request, and to keep accurate records concerning the services you are requesting through the Right Media site.  This information is not collected or used by the Yield Manager technology to deliver ads to you.
  * The Right Media website collects non-personally identifiable information, including demographic information (such as city or state) and web site activity information.  Our website collects non-personally identifiable information from browsers that send information such as the site you visit, your IP address, browser type, language and time of your visit.  This website also uses web beacons to remember the pages of sections of the site you visit.  We use this information to analyze the performance and usefulness of this site.



**Transparency, Choice and Opt-Out**

The Yield Manager technology does not collect any personally identifiable information about you during the ad delivery process.  Accordingly, Right Media is unable to provide access or the ability to change information stored by our technology. 

The Yield Manager technology uses cookies for ad selection in order to enhance ad effectiveness.  Right Media believes that cookies enhance your web experience by limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level of relevant ads.  Because some users may not want information to be collected using cookies,, we offer consumers the ability to opt out from our use of data associated with the Yield Manager cookie to deliver relevant ads.  You can disable the Yield Manager cookie by [opting out](http://ad.yieldmanager.com/opt-out).  By opting out, the Yield Manager technology will place an opt-out cookie on your computer that will prevent our technology from using profiled information about you.

Because cookies are browser specific, if you use more than one browser on your computer, you will need to opt-out of the Yield Manager cookie on the other browser(s) in order to opt-out completely.  Please note that you will need to opt-out of the Yield Manager cookie again if you buy a new computer, upgrade or change the browser on your existing computer, or delete the Yield Manager opt-out cookie.   


**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Right Media may provide copies of log files to advertisers, clients and certain partners relating to the specific transactions they are a party to.  These files contain information that allows clients to analyze the effectiveness and performance of their advertising campaign.  Our clients also have the ability to use any or all of the information collected in connection with our services for their own purposes. The information provided to our clients does not contain personally identifiable information about you.  In cases where Right Media provides information to our clients, our clients are obligated to use the information they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

Right Media may share the information it collects with selected partners, vendors, agents or others who work on our behalf, in order to provide products or services you’ve requested, or when we have your permission.  Right Media may share information about you if Right Media is acquired by or merged with another company. 

Right Media may also share information in the event that we are asked to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims, or as otherwise permitted by law.

**Report Adware and Spyware Problems**

Right Media does not control or condone the creation or supply of these ads on your computer.  Occasionally a website, software publisher, or other entity with access to the ad serving process will bundle ads with spyware or adware without Right Media’s knowledge or consent.  In these cases, Right Media does everything we can to track down who is doing it and put an end to it.

Pop-up ads originate from two sources: websites that show pop-up ads to generate advertising revenue; or programs installed on your computer.  Such ad-enabled programs are often bundled with freeware/shareware and peer-to-peer sharing programs that you may have downloaded.

If you would like help in removing the adware or spyware, please contact us using the [contact form](https://my.yieldmanager.com/spyware_form.php), or at the address below.  Please note that in order to prevent this from happening again to you and to others, we also request that you send us the click-through URL to assist us in identifying the party responsible for this problem.   


**Other**

Right Media maintains safeguards to protect the security, integrity and privacy of the personally identifiable information in our control.

Right Media may update this policy from time to time.  Please check this privacy policy for updates.
