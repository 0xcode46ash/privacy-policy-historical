** We use cookies on this website to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Yieldify. A cookie is a text file sent by a web server to a web browser, and stored by the browser (session cookies) or stored on hard disc (Persistent cookies). The text file is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. This enables the web server to identify and track the web browser and lets us learn about your behavior and usage patterns when you are on our Service. 

We may send a Persistent cookie which may be stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. We may use the information we obtain from the cookie in the administration of this website, to improve the website’s usability and for marketing purposes.

An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session.
