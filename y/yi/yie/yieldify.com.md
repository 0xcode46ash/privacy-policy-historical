Log file information is automatically reported by your browser each time you access a web page on our Service. Yieldify may gather information such as IP address, internal session ID, user’s domain, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and other such information. An “Internet protocol address” or “IP Address” is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. Such information will not identify you personally: it is statistical data about our visitors and their use of our site. This statistical data does not identify any personal details whatsoever. It is used only to provide statistical information regarding the use of our website.

Zeus Enterprise Ltd (Yieldify) and our partners, affiliates, or analytics or service providers, uses technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags, and scripts to analyze trends, administer the website, tracking users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

We use cookies for our shopping cart, to remember users’ settings (e.g. language preference), for authentication. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. If you reject cookies, you may still use our website, but your ability to use some features or areas of our website may be limited.

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our website or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this website and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/)  (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/) ). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

We use Local Storage Objects, such as HTML5, to store content information and preferences. Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our website or to display advertising based upon your web browsing activity also use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

However, we will not sell, transfer, or use the information relating to the terminated account of an individual in any way. The transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure and therefore Yieldify cannot guarantee the security of data sent to us electronically and transmission of such data is therefore entirely at your own risk.
