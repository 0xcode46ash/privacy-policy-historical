# YachtWorld.com

The YachtWorld.com Web site ("Web site") is owned and operated by boats.com, Inc. ("Boats"). The following privacy statement describes the practices of Boats with respect to the collection, maintenance and disclosure of information on the Web site. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please contact [cs@yachtworld.com](mailto:cs@yachtworld.com) for more information.

**Information Collected**   
This Web site offers services to marine professional individuals such as vessel brokers and dealers who want either to sell boats, as well as to site visitors who want to buy boats. Our membership program is created for marine professional individuals. To participate in the membership program a member, on his/her own behalf or on behalf of his/her company, is required to submit certain information about the company and personal information about the contact person within the company. The personal information required is a contact name, and postal and e-mail addresses. The provision of this personal information is not optional and by not submitting the requested information we will not be able to provide members with the services they wish to obtain on the Web site.

To list a boat to find a broker, site visitors must complete the requested forms. By virtue of these forms we collect a limited amount of personal information such as: (i) name, and (ii) postal and e-mail addresses. The provision of this personal information is not optional and by not submitting the requested information we will not be able to provide site visitors with the services they wish to obtain on this Web site. Through the requested forms we also solicit the provision of non-personal information about boats and other details.

To improve services and the quality of the Web site as well as our site visitors' experience on the Web site, we conduct surveys and contests among site visitors that request the provision of personal information such as name and e-mail address as well as non-personal information regarding the site visitor's experience on the Web site. Participation in the surveys and contests and the corresponding submission of personal information is optional. 

To keep site visitors informed with respect to new listings of boats on the Web site we offer the Personal Boat Shopper feature, which is an e-mailing list service. In order to provide this e-mailing list service we collect e-mail addresses from site visitors who want to participate in the Personal Boat Shopper. The provision of information in the form of e-mail is not optional if a site visitor chooses to participate in the e-mailing list service.

To apply for a job with us a site visitor might send a resume for our consideration. We collect information provided in the resume.

**Use of  
Personal Information Collected**   
Personal information collected on the Web site is used primarily for the purposes it is requested. For example, contact information such as name, e-mail and postal addresses of a prospective member is used to inform him/her whether his/her application for membership has been approved, or whether a broker contacts a site visitor who listed a vessel in search of an interested broker, or to provide the site visitor with the Personal Boat Shopper messages. 

We use non-personal information such as aggregate demographic data and information about our members' companies and boats to analyze and develop our marketing strategy and to determine how site visitors found out about us, our site visitors' interests regarding our services and how to further improve the Web site based upon these data.

We may disclose personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the requirements of the law or comply with a legal process served on the Web site. 

**Partners**   
Some of our partners offer services on the Web site. To provide services our partners collect personal information from site visitors. We exercise great care in choosing our partners but we neither control nor are we responsible for our partners' information collection practices. Every time our partners request the provision of information, site visitors will be notified that a different privacy policy applies, and site visitors will be granted an opportunity to review our partner's privacy policy to make an informed decision whether to provide personal information.

**Correcting/Updating  
Personal Information**   
If a site visitor or member's personal information changes, or if a member no longer desires our service, we have provided a way to correct, update or remove personal information. Site visitors or members can have their personal information updated, changed or removed by contacting a customer service representative at [cs@yachtworld.com](mailto:cs@yachtworld.com).

**Forums**   
Forums are very popular informative discussion opportunities for our site visitors, and for our members, a members-only discussion opportunity. Please note, however, any information a forum visitor posts in a forum session becomes public information. Exercise caution when you decide to disclose personal information in forum sessions because all site visitors will have access to this information. Members are also advised to exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information in the members-only forum, because all members will have access to this information.

**Cookies**   
We use cookies, which are small text files that are stored on the site visitor's computer, to gather and keep track of information related to the site visitor.  Cookies also help us review the Web site traffic patterns and improve our Web site. Although many Web site browsers are set to accept cookies, a site visitor can set his/her Web browser to reject cookies, but this may prevent the site visitor from using some of the convenience features of the Web site. Non-personal information collected through cookies is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Log Files**   
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track site visitors' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Links to Other Web Sites**   
The Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Boats is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage site visitors to be alert when they leave the Web site and to review the privacy statements of each and every Web site that they visit before disclosing personal information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected on this Web site. 

If you have any questions about the security at the Web site, you can send an e-mail message to [cs@yachtworld.com](mailto:cs@yachtworld.com). 

**Children's Use of Web site**   
The YachtWorld.com site is suitable for viewing by all members of your family. In fact, we know that some site visitors call on the talents of young people to assist in searching for a boat to buy. This section also includes certain guidelines from the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

For the protection and privacy of children, we seriously discourage unsupervised persons under the age of 13 from posting messages to any forum on YachtWorld.com. Further, we encourage parental guidelines that match ours with respect to our forums. This guideline protects children and their privacy.

We do not knowingly acknowledge or accept orders, registrations or requests for any goods or services from persons under the age of 13. If it comes to our attention that a request has come from a person under the age of 13, we will not respond to such a request. Instead we will automatically delete any information provided by a person who acknowledges being less than 13 years of age.

**Notification of Changes**   
It is your responsibility to follow our privacy link, so you are always aware of our current practices. Anyone can follow the privacy link on any page on our site, so that site visitors and members are always aware of our current information collection, maintenance and disclosure practices. Each update is noted with the last updated date. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify site visitors and members by way of an e-mail message. Site visitors will have an option whether to let us use their information in a different manner.
