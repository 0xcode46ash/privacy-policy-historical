### Consumer Privacy Policy

(YASHI ADVERTISING TECHNOLOGY)

Updated October 5, 2016

1\. General

Yashi, Inc. (“Yashi”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), is committed to safeguarding your privacy.  We use this privacy policy to clearly disclose to you our privacy practices in a manner that is easy to understand.  This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) describes, among other things, the types of information collected through use of our digital advertising technology (“Yashi Platform”), including how such information may be used and/or disclosed, and our practices for data choice.  Through the Yashi Platform, Yashi is able to provide to its clients, technology that can be used by such clients to display and serve ads to consumers who access a particular website, mobile application, or online content.  To review our privacy policy governing our corporate website, please go to [Corporate Privacy Policy](https://yashi.com/corporate-privacy-policy).

We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time and will post the revised version on this page, with a notice of such change in the modified Privacy Policy.  It is important that you review this Privacy Policy regularly to ensure you are updated as to any changes. 

2\. What Type of Information Do We Collect From You?

In providing an advertisement through the Yashi Platform, we may collect Platform Data. Platform Data may include:

  1. information related to your computer, including your browser type (e.g., Internet Explorer), operating system (e.g., Windows), and computer monitor resolution;
  2. your Internet Protocol (IP) address when accessing a website or mobile application;
  3. your internet provider;
  4. sites and/or applications you visited, including information regarding your use of our client’s websites or mobile applications, and any websites or mobile applications in which our client’s advertisements are displayed;
  5. web pages and advertisements you view,
  6. clickstream data; 
  7. unique identifiers, including but not limited to mobile device identification numbers, that can identify the physical location of such devices and operating system device identifiers (e.g., IDFA, Android ID);
  8. information collected through cookies, web beacons, and other technologies;
  9. information about your interactions with video content, such as the type of content viewed; and
  10. information or inferences about a user’s interests.



Platform Data does not include information that by itself, individually identifies an individual, such as your e-mail address, phone number, or name.

3\. How Do We Collect Information?

When Yashi, or Yashi on behalf of a client, purchases online advertisements on a website/application, and an individual interacts with such advertisement or visits the website/application, Platform Data is collected on such website or application through the use of cookies, web beacons, pixels, tags, and other similar technologies.  Once collected, the Platform Data is used by Yashi to target advertisements, measure the effectiveness of advertisements, and to deliver interest-based advertisements on behalf of Yashi’s clients.

4\. How Do We Use Cookies, Web Beacons, Pixels, Tags, and Other Technologies?

_Cookies._   A cookie is a small text file created by a website and stored in a user’s web browser.  Yashi uses cookies to store data for: advertising and/or interest-based advertising purposes; delivery and reporting of advertisements; tracking users’ responses to an ad (e.g., click rate and conversions); reviewing the frequency and time of the display of an advertisement; storage of user preferences; and the collection, aggregation and analysis of anonymous tracking data to help measure and track traffic and general user behavior.  Further, to better serve relevant ads to you, we may also assign an identifier (“ID”) to your device, computer, or browser when serving an ad.  The ID may be implemented on your computer/device through a cookie.  Such method does not enable Yashi to personally identify you.  The ID can be used to attempt to match an assigned user by inference, based on the user’s activities tracked across multiple devices or browsers. 

_Tags, Beacons, and Pixels.  _ Tags are computer codes incorporated into a HTML/JavaScript code of a web page and delivered to a web browser or application when the web page loads.  A beacon, web beacon, or a pixel is a transparent web image that can be placed on a web page.  Overall, Yashi utilizes tags, beacons, and/or pixels to set cookies, collect data, extend audiences between multiple marketing partners, and to serve more relevant ads. 

Our third party service providers, advertisers and affiliates may also use cookies, web beacons and other similar technologies to manage or measure the performance of the information displayed or delivered over a website/application.  For more information regarding this use, please see our “How Do We Work With Third Parties?” section below.

5\. How Do We Use The Platform Data?

The Yashi Platform allows advertisers to buy ad space and publishers to sell ad space. The Platform Data collected may be used by Yashi’s clients or by Yashi on behalf of Yashi’s clients to: evaluate and modify existing services and features; provide demographic and geographic information regarding users to Yashi’s clients utilizing the Yashi Platform; identify a target audience to serve an advertisement and obtain the best advertisement response rate; provide interest-based advertising; aggregate statistics related to the Platform Data; develop new services and features that may be of interest to you; prepare advertising segments that may be used to target based on demographics, geography and/or relation to the content on the viewing page; control the amount of times a user may see an advertisement; sequentially organize ads for purposes of viewing; and analyze the response of users to the advertisements.

6\. How Do We Disclose Your Information?

We may share Platform Data with our affiliates, service providers, clients, related companies, and advertisers.  We may also disclose your Platform Data in response to a court order or subpoena, in response to a law enforcement agency request; when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or to anyone that could be harmed by such activities; in situations involving threats to the physical safety of any person; where it is necessary to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activity or suspected fraud; or as otherwise required by law.  We may transfer Platform Data to another company, if we are acquired by, sold to or merged with such company.

Our agents and contractors who have access to your Platform Data are required to protect the information in a manner consistent with our Privacy Policy and may not use the information for any other purposes other than to carry out the activity they are performing on our behalf.

We continue to expand our online presence in order to offer users rich and deep interactive experiences.  We may share information we collect about you so that we can provide you with information about products and services that might interest you.

We may share aggregated or anonymized Platform Data, with third parties.  Much of the information we collect is in the form of aggregated statistics, such as the traffic generated by visits on various pages within our Yashi Platform, and the habits and preferences of our audience.  Such aggregated data does not include any information that would identify you personally. We may use such aggregated data and disclose it to third parties as we see fit.

7\. How Do We Work with Third Parties?

We may work with one or more advertisers, advertising agencies, advertising networks, service providers, and/or audience segment providers to help deliver advertisements or other content. These third parties may utilize cookies, web beacons, or similar technologies on your computer, mobile, or other device to serve you advertisements or content tailored to your perceived or stated interests and/or preferences based on information you provided, and/or your browsing behavior, on their websites and/or other sites and applications you have visited.  These third parties may also use such technologies to help determine whether you previously have seen particular advertisements or content and to avoid sending you duplicates.  In doing so, these third parties collect information such as your browser type, your operating system, web pages visited, time of visits, content viewed, ads viewed, and other click stream data.  In all of the above instances, this Privacy Policy will not apply to any information collected by these third parties. This collection of information is not under our control and such third party information practices may be different than ours.

Further, these third parties may offer you a way to choose not to have your information used for interest-based advertising purposes.  To manage your preference for interest-based advertising provided by third parties, please see Section 8, “What Are Your Choices?” for more information.
