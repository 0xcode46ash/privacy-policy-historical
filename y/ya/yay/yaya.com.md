Because collecting information on our registered users is an integral part of our business model, it is EXTREMELY important that you, our customer, feel comfortable furnishing us with this information. We are absolutely committed to protecting your private information as evidenced in our Privacy Policy, below.

**Yaya will not furnish your specific personal information to ANYONE**. We use the registration information to better serve you on our site, or to provide aggregate information to advertisers. The only time we would violate this policy is if we are required to share your information by law (and served with a subpoena, search warrant or court order). 

           **a. What is "aggregate information"**? Aggregate information is non-specific information on large groups of individuals used to show trends and patterns (e.g., women between the ages of 20 and 35 years old). We repeat, no specific personal information is given to anyone without your express permission. 

           **b. Why are you giving aggregate information to advertisers**? We could say that we want to better serve you through more relevant advertisements, but we don't want to lie to you - the reason is money. Cashola. Moola. Cheddar. Advertisers pay us to place advertisements on our site and in our games, but they want to make sure that the relevant content reaches the target audience. This aggregate information allows us to display specific advertisements to the people who are most likely to be interested in the content. This excites advertisers, which in turn pays our electric bill. You dig?

**Yaya will not contact you without your permission**. There is only one small exception to this rule. We may send you an email introducing ourselves you once, and only once, if someone has entered your name as a referral.

**Security**. Yaya employs strict security measures that protect the misuse, loss or alteration of information under our control. The servers for our site are stored in a physically secure, climate-controlled facility and all information is stored behind a barrier, known as a "firewall," that prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing our servers. Access to data is limited and strictly enforced. 

**Use of Cookies**. Yaya, like thousands of other web sites, uses cookies. In case you don't know, cookies are small files stored by your browser onto your hard drive. They do not damage your system or files in any way. We use cookies for a variety of purposes: To personalize the site and to access your account information (how many points you have). We use cookies to track the games you play and how long you play them. Cookies will also help us target specific advertisements based upon your interests.

Some of our business partners use cookies on our site. However, we do not have access to or control over these cookies.

**Log Files**. Yaya uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to your personally identifiable information.

**Links**. Yaya contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site.

**Referrals**. If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site, we'll ask you for the friend's name and email address. Yaya will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. Yaya stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email. The friend may contact Yaya to request the removal of this information from its database. 

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**. If your personally identifiable information changes, such as your zip code, or if a you no longer desire to be a registered user, Yaya will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove the data you provided to us. This can usually be done at the member information page or by emailing our Customer Support.

**Kids**. Yaya wants everyone to enjoy the quality games we provide. However, children under the age of 14 must get parental consent prior to registering on Yaya (we at Yaya believe that some parents must get consent from their children before registering for our site, but that is a different story).

**Bust us**. If at any time you believe that Yaya has not adhered to these principles, please notify us by email at [privacy@yaya.com](mailto:privacy@yaya.com) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly determine and correct the problem.
