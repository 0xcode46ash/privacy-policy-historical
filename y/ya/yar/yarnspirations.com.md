# Privacy Policy | Yarnspirations

### Our Pledge

Spinrite LP ("Yarnspirations.com", "we" or "us") respects your privacy and pledges to earn and keep your trust. All personal information that we collect from you is maintained in accordance with this privacy policy and will not be used in ways that are contrary to this privacy policy. "Personal information" is any information that identifies you, or by which your identity could be deduced. It does not include the name, title, business address or business telephone number of an employee of an organization.

###   
Consent

In most cases, we will ask you to provide explicit consent if we collect, use or disclose your personal information, however sometimes your consent may be implied through your conduct with us. For example, if you provide your personal information to become a member, you consent to the use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy.

### Personal Information

**Collection**

We collect personal information only by lawful and fair means and not in an intrusive way. We usually collect personal information directly from you, for example, through online information forms. Sometimes we may use the information that you provided when you signed up as a member, however we will only do so in accordance with this privacy policy.

  
**Use**

Personal information collected by Yarnspirations.com about its users is used internally by authorized employees of Yarnspirations.com for three main purposes: First, we collect personal information to figure out which areas, features, and products our users like the most and find most helpful, so we can continue to improve the web site. Second, we collect personal information in order to personalize the web site for our users (for example, it allows us to know if you're a member or not). Finally, we collect personal information to enable our users to participate in sweepstakes, contests, services, and other activities on our web site.

******  
**Disclosure********

Your personal information will only be disclosed to third parties in the following circumstances:

  * when we are required or authorized by law to do so, for example, if a court issues a subpoena;
  * when you expressly or impliedly consent to the disclosure;
  * when the services we are providing to you require us to give your personal information to a third party your consent will be implied, unless you tell us otherwise;
  * where it is necessary to establish or collect amounts owed to us;
  * if we engage a third party to provide administrative services to us (such as computer back-up services or archival file storage) and the third party is bound by this privacy policy;
  * if the personal information is already publicly known.



###   
Contests

If you choose to participate in one of our contests, we may have to collect personal information in order to allow you to participate in that contest. In addition, your personal information may be used in a specific way in relation to that contest. All contest details are posted during the contest period and will disclose how your personal information will be used. Those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this privacy policy.

###   
Email

If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. However, aside from our reply to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a particular service that involves email communications. There may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list or electronic newsletter that will send information about our web sites or our advertisers to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications. You may request at any time that we not email you in the future by clicking the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email that you receive from us. If you unsubscribe, we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email communications as soon as practicable.

###   
Security

**Cookies**

At times we send your computer a "cookie," a small piece of data that is stored in a file on your hard drive. Cookies are a standard procedure for websites, and those from our website are secure and do not carry viruses. We use cookies to give you better, more personalized service once you've become a member of Yarnspirations.com. This information is for internal use only; we don't share it with others. You're always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our web site may not work properly for you if you do.

  
**IP Address Tracking**

All computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. Collecting IP addresses allows us to administer and analyze our web site and report non-personal information (such as how many visitors we have). When you call up a Yarnspirations.com page on your computer, Yarnspirations.com servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log.

  
**General Security**

Your personal information and your password are safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to your data.

  
**Reviewing and Changing Your Member Profile**

As a member of Yarnspirations.com, you can review and change the information in your member profile at any time. To do that, click the membership link at the top of any page.

###   
Changes
