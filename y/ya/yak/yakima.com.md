## Privacy Statement

Privacy matters. As a visitor to yakima.com, you don't have to worry about your privacy or security.

There is a limited amount of information we can collect without having you answer a few questions. We automatically collect only the domain name (IP address), but not the email address of visitors to our site. If you want to hear from us, you have to tell us and provide a way for us to contact you. If you fill out your warranty information or one of our surveys, your information is stored in Yakima's customer database. You are not at risk of being deluged with junk mail, because we don't rent or sell our online list. If you have filled out the survey or warranty forms, requested further information, and entered your email address, we'll send you a message when something special happens at yakima.com. A major site update or new season's products qualifies as something special. You might receive three or four emails from us in the course of a year.

Please read on for more details regarding our commitment to your privacy.
