POLICY CONCERNING LINKS AND CO-BRANDED SITES

This Yamaha web site may allow you to link directly to sites operated by our service providers or marketing partners. Some of these sites may be “co-branded” with a Yamaha logo; even so, they are not operated or maintained by Yamaha. These sites may ask you for personally identifiable information. 

Because these web sites are operated by business partners or third parties, you should remember that Yamaha is not responsible for the content or practices of such Web sites. These links are provided for your convenience only and should be used with your discretion and prudent judgement. Links from our Site to third party sites do not constitute sponsorship, endorsement, or approval by Yamaha of the content, policies, practices of such third party sites. Yamaha is not responsible for any information these sites may obtain and does not oversee their policies or practices in collecting personally identifiable information.

**The Privacy Policies of these other sites may differ from those of Yamaha. Therefore, once you have left this Site via such a link, you must review each site’s privacy policies separately. You should make your own determination of the acceptability of each linked site.**

This Site may also be linked to Web sites operated by companies affiliated with Yamaha. You are advised to refer to the privacy policies and practices of these sites before providing any personally identifiable information.

NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION

When visitors come to this Site, Yamaha collects non-personally identifiable information or “aggregate” information concerning how its visitors use this Site, including the pages viewed and links used. Collecting such information involves the logging of IP addresses, the visitor’s operating system, types of browser software and internet service providers used by each visitor to this or linked sites. Although such information generally is not personally identifiable, it can be used to determine the IP address of the visitor’s Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of her/his point of connectivity to the internet. This information allows us to analyze and improve the effectiveness of our services and those of our affiliates and service providers.

USE OF “COOKIES” AND TRACKING TECHNOLOGY

This Site and its service providers use current industry methods, including “cookies” and tracking technology (“clear gifs”, “web beacons”, “log files”, etc.), to enable Yamaha to make visits to this Site and communications with our visitors more personalized and effective, and to analyze the services we provide through this Site. For example, “cookies” are tags sent to reside on the visitor’s computer, to enhance a visitor’s experience at our site, to allow repeat visitors to be served more quickly and efficiently, or to tell us where our visitors go and how our visitors use our Site and related sites. Yamaha does not use cookies to obtain personally identifiable information about a user that was not previously provided.

Visitors may receive cookies from other third party sites that they visit, including service provider sites. Yamaha cannot control the content or use of these cookies or tracking technologies by third party sites or service providers. Visitors should consult their browser’s manual for instructions on how to refuse or disable cookies. Refusing or disabling cookies may affect our ability to complete requests you have made for products or services from this Site. Yamaha may disclose non-personally identifiable information to affiliates or advertisers regarding content viewing, traffic levels or browser paths to their advertisements on this Site. 

THE SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION

Yamaha uses current technologies to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We follow industry-standard methodologies, including the utilization of SSL (Secure Socket Layers) where appropriate, to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the data provided. However, data transmission or storage on the internet can not be guaranteed to be 100% secure and Yamaha does not make such a guarantee. You should take all precautions to safeguard your passwords and any account information that you may have or provide and to employ current virus-scanning or firewall software and other security safeguards. You should also log out of your account and close your browser window when you are done.

However, there may be residual information that will remain within our databases and logs that may or may not contain personally identifiable information or that is very difficult to locate and remove. There may be information that has been transmitted already to third parties which is beyond our control. Your request for deletion of this information may prevent or reduce our ability to service your earlier request to this Site or to access this web site in the future. We will follow the policy outlined here, but we are not responsible for any failure or shortcoming in deleting or controlling the disclosure of information you have made available through use of this Site or for the timing of our actions after your request. 

For each of your requests, you should receive an email response from Yamaha, confirming receipt of the request. If you do not receive such a response, you must assume that your request has not been received by our servers or processed. Your request should be repeated until receipt confirmation is received or, as an alternative, your request should be sent by regular mail to the address indicated above.
