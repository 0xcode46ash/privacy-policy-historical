###### New Construction Housings

In contrast to remodeling housings, new construction housings are bulkier and need to be installed between joist beams or onto hangar bars and thus you need full access to the space above the fixture.

If the environment exposes the lighting system to moisture condensation, then the location is a damp location. Lights that are approved for damp locations can be used in sheltered outdoor areas such as roofed porches or interior locations subject to moderated degrees of moisture such as basements.

###### Wet Location

If the lighting system is exposed to direct impact by water from splashing or dripping, which will make the fixture wet, then the location is a wet location. Your most common wet locations are uncovered outdoor areas.
