If you believe your credit card/debit card has been used in an unauthorized manner on our site (as determined by your credit card company), we will work together with the credit card company to provide any information we can to their fraud department.

We also accept PayPal as a form of payment that many online customers feel safer using.

We ensure that your transaction is safe and hassle free.

##   
CVV (credit card security code)

Draganfly Innovations does require that you to enter your credit card's 3 to 4 digit security code (CVV). This information is on the actual credit card and we feel makes the transaction more secure. We cannot process your order online or via phone without it. If there is ever a concern regarding the card, we do call for authorization to the card issuing bank as an extra step for our customers' security as well as ours. If you have any questions about this requirement, please contact us.

##   
Bank or credit card company liability

Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (US customers only) your card issuing bank or credit card company cannot hold you liable for more than $50 of unauthorized or fraudulent charges on a credit card. The liability for any unauthorized use of a debit card may be higher or different, so always check your cardholder agreement with your bank. Remember: If unauthorized use of your credit or debit card does occur, you must notify your card provider, in accordance with the agreement you have with the company.
