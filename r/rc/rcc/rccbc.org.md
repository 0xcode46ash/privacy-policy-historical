Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

**What this Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy covers the Rural Coordination Centre of BC's (RCC _bc_ ) treatment of personally identifiable information that may be collected when you are on the site, and when you use our services. This policy also covers RCC _bc_ 's treatment of any personally identifiable information that our business partners share with us.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to people that we do not employ or manage, including without limitation, any of our affiliates or business partners.

When you register with RCC _bc_ , we ask for your name, email address,  postal code, occupation and other voluntary information. Once you register with us and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.

We automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, RCC _bc_ cookie information and the page you requested.

RCC _bc_ uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see on our pages, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, improve our services, conduct research, and to contact you about specials and new products or for service announcements or administrative messages relating to the RCC _bc_ service.

Information found under Resources has been gathered by RCC _bc_ for research and reference purposes.  It has not been and can not be reproduced for any purpose, used for commercial use, or modified in any way.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

  * RCC _bc_ will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone.
  * We will not share personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people unless:
  * We have your consent to share this information; 
  * We need to share the information with companies who work on behalf of RCC _bc_ to provide a product or service to you. Please know that whenever we share your personal information with these trusted business partners, they work under confidentiality agreements. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.); 
  * We reasonably believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required or permitted by law; 
  * We respond to warrants, subpoenas, court orders or legal process or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or 
  * We may transfer information about you if RCC _bc_ is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, we will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

RCCbc allows other companies that are presenting advertisements on some of our pages to set and access their cookies on your computer.

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who, as part of their job, we believe need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you.   
We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.   
In the event that you believe that your personal safety is at risk or if you believe that you may be the victim of identity theft or other illegal conduct, please contact the appropriate federal, provincial or local law enforcement agencies directly.
