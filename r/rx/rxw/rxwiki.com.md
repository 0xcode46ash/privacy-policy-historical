This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you, how that information is used and other related topics about your use of the Site. We may change this Privacy Policy from time-to-time at our sole discretion without notice. As a result, we encourage you to review this Privacy Policy from time to time. 

The Site contains links to other sites. Once you enter another Internet site (whether through an advertisement, service or content link), be aware that RxWiki is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage you to look for and review the privacy policies of each and every Internet site that you visit.

  * Personally identifiable information that can be traced back to an individual person such as your name, date of birth, home address, email address ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII"). 
  * Information that can not be traced back to an individual person such as the type of web browser you are using or aggregate information such as the total number of users over 65 years old accessing the Site per month ("Non-Personal Information" or "NPI"). 



Personally Identifiable Information is referred to as "Personal Information," and Personal Information and Non-Personal Information are collectively referred to as "Information."

## [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used")] Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used 

The following types of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) may be collected and stored by the Site and used by RxWiki: 

Name, Address(es), other (PII) 

As part of registering for the RxWiki newsletter, you may be asked to voluntarily provide your real name, address, and other such real contact information. Your name will be used for newsletter delivery, and communications with RxWiki. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Network Address")] Network Address 

Each time you access the Site, the Site will record the network address of your computer ("Network Address"). Although this address is used to identify your computer, it may or may not be a unique address. For example, in some cases, your computer will have a unique Network Address, while in other cases, the public transmission to/from the Internet will be completed using a shared Network Address that is common to all users on a particular portion of the Internet. This saves addresses by allowing routers to use a single public Network Address, then translate the shared public Network Address into unique private addresses behind the gateway router. A Network Address may be traceable only to your Internet access service provider or all the way to your own location. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Site Logging")] Site Logging 

Every time you visit a page of the Site, a small amount of information is recorded on your actual activities, such as which page(s) is/are viewed. This information is used to form an overall statistical picture of the Site, such as determining popular Content, other Internet sites linked to from RxWiki, and the types of web browsers being used to access the Site. These logs may also be used to solve technical problems and to investigate abuse of the Site, vandalism, harassment or other violations of the Terms. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Email Address")] Email Address 

As part of registering for the newsletter on this site, you will be asked to voluntarily provide your email address. Your email address will be used to deliver the Rxwiki newsletter and for other communications with RxWiki. At your option, you may remove your email address from the newsletter subscription list at any time. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Emails and Other Communications")] Emails and Other Communications 

When you send the Site emails, letters, faxes or other communications, we will retain and store such communications in order to keep a reliable record and validate the information. This also includes any voice recordings we may make of phone conversations we may have with you. 

## [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Non-Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used")] Non-Personal Information We Collect and How it is Used 

When you access the Site, we collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our Site. We use Cookies or Web Beacons (both defined and described below) to collect or store Personal Information, or link Non-Personal Information from Cookies or Web Beacons to Personal Information, without your prior permission. 

We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our Site and your use of the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons. 

"Cookies" are small files placed on your computer by the Site to hold information such as the times and dates you visit the Site, information about purchases or requests, and validation information for members-only sections. Every computer accessing this Site is assigned a different Cookie. 

"Web Beacons" are small, often-transparent, graphic images that may be placed on the Site to monitor your behavior while on the Site. The information collected by Cookies and/or Web Beacons (i) helps us dynamically adapt Content on the Site or in newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our Site and the sites of selected 'sponsors' and 'advertisers', (iii) helps us determine how many people open our emails and (iv) helps us determine why certain actions are being taken. We may also use Cookie and/or Web Beacon information to target certain Content to you or to determine the popularity of certain Content. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aides, and as session timers. 

Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies with instructions on how to do this found in the "Help" section of the toolbar. This may or may not remove all Web Beacons from a downloaded page. Even if you reject our Cookies, and this results in certain functions and conveniences of our Site not work properly, you do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use our Site. 

## [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Opt In and Opt Out")] Opt In and Opt Out 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Opt In")] Opt In 

You can access most portions of the Site without entering any information and without expressly having the consent to any specific question (beyond complying with the Terms). "Opting-In" (and its derivatives) however is the process by which you expressly indicate that you want to participate in the Site or one of its features, options, tools or services. In many such cases, you will be asked to voluntarily provide some Personal Information to validate your identity and expressly indicate your intention to Opt-Out. For example, you may have to enter your name and email address, and then check a "Yes" box in order to receive a newsletter. In these cases, it is common for us to store such Personal Information on the Site in order to facilitate your request. 

In the event we propose to use such Personal Information for a purpose other than its original intent, we will ask for your prior consent or to Opt-Out. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Opt Out")] Opt Out 

"Opting-Out" (and its derivatives) is the process by which you expressly indicate that you want to stop participating in the Site or one of its features, options, tools or services. In these cases, you will need to provide some Personal Information to validate your identity and take some affirmative action to expressly indicate your intention to Opt-Out. For example, you may have to enter your name and email address, and then check a "Cancel" box in order to stop receiving a newsletter. In these cases and if your Personal Information is no longer needed by the Site, we will delete such Personal Information from the Site. 

In some cases, you can also Opt-Out without entering any Personal Information by simply clicking a button such as "Unsubscribe" from a newsletter. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Default")] Default
