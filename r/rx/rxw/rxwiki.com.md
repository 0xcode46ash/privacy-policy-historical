# RxWiki:Privacy Policy - RxWiki

### From RxWiki

Axirim takes personal privacy very seriously. This policy applies to all of the Axirim owned and operated services and websites. It does not apply to companies that Axirim utilizes as third parties or for partner relationships. Each of these companies have their own privacy policies and you are strongly encouraged to look for and review the polices of each and every Internet site that you visit or are directed to. In addition, this site contains links to other Internet sites. Once you enter another Internet site (whether through an advertisement, service or content link), be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these other sites and that these privacy terms do not apply to those sites. Once again, we encourage you to look for and review the privacy policies of each and every Internet site that you visit. 

This Privacy Policy will tell you what information we collect about you, how that information is used and other related subjects about your use of the site. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time at our sole discretion. However, version dates may be posted with a notice banner on the Web site, through our eNewsletters, and/or via email notification. 

The following policies describe how we treat: 

  * Personally identifiable information that can be traced back to an individual person such as your name, date of birth, home address or email address ("Personally Identifiable Information" or "PII") 
  * Information that can not be traced back to an individual person such as the type of web browser you are using or aggregate information such as the total number of users over 65 years old accessing the site per months ("Non-Personal Information" or "NPI")

As part of registering for the RxWiki.com eNewsletter, any other Axirim newsletter (individually and collectively, "Newsletters") or for use on our sites, you will be asked to provide your email address.

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Demographic Information")] Demographic Information

As part of registering for Newsletters or for use on our sites, we may ask you for specific demographic information so we may strategically target information that is more relevant to you and your interests. For example, we may ask you for gender, race, subject matter interest, age and other information that would aid us in delivering targeted services to you. Axirim may also combine information that we have about you with information we obtain from business partners or other parties. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Polls, Surveys and Quizzes")] Polls, Surveys and Quizzes

As part of using various applications on our site such as polls, surveys, quizzes and other interactive features, we collect information including answers and other input. We may share the results of these applications in aggregate with third parties. 

## [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Our Commitment to Children's Privacy")] Our Commitment to Children's Privacy

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to Axirim. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our Web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Web site is structured to attract anyone under 13. 

## [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Non-Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used")] Non-Personal Information We Collect and How It Is Used

When you access the site, we may collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our site. We may use Cookies or Web Beacons (both defined and described below) to collect or store Personal Information, or link Non-Personal Information from Cookies or Web Beacons to Personal Information, without your prior permission. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Cookies and Web Beacons")] Cookies and Web Beacons

We may collect Non-Personal Information about your use of our site and your use of the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers through the use of Cookies and/or Web Beacons. "Cookies" are small files placed on your computer by the site to hold information such as the times and dates you visit the site, information about purchases or requests and validation information for members-only sections. "Web Beacons" are small, often-transparent, graphic images that may be placed on the site to monitor your behavior while on the site. Every computer accessing this site is assigned a different Cookie. The information collected by Cookies and/or Web Beacons (i) helps us dynamically adapt content on the site or in Newsletters, (ii) allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and the sites of selected sponsors and advertisers, (iii) how many people open our emails and (iv) for what purposes certain actions are being taken. 

We may also use Cookie and/or Web Beacon information to target certain content to you or to determine the popularity of certain content. Cookies are also used to facilitate a user's log-in, as navigation aides and as session timers. 

Most browser software can be set to reject all Cookies with instructions on how to do this found in the "Help" section of the toolbar. This may or may not remove all Web Beacons from a downloaded page. You do not have to accept our Cookies in order to productively use our site. However, if you reject our Cookies, certain functions and conveniences of our site may not work properly. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: 3rd Party Advertisers and Cookies")] 3rd Party Advertisers and Cookies

We allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. We will not give any third-party ad servers access to any personally identifying information about you. 

### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Cookies")] Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Cookies

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). We have relationships with various third party ad servers. Please [click here](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=Third_Party_Ad_Privacy_Policies "Third Party Ad Privacy Policies") to see a list of third party advertisers and links to their privacy policies and opt out pages (if available). 

#### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Network Address")] Network Address

Each time you access the site, the site may record the network address of your computer ("Network Address"). Although this address is used to identify your computer, it may or may not be a unique address. For example, in some cases, your computer will have a unique Network Address while in other cases the public transmission to/from the Internet may be completed using a shared Network Address that is common to all users on a particular portion of the Internet. This saves the address by allowing routers to use a single public Network Address, and then translates the shared public Network Address into unique private address behind the gateway router. Network Address may be traceable only to your Internet access service provider or all the way to your own location. 

#### [[edit](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Privacy_Policy&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Site Logging")] Site Logging 

Every time you visit a page of the site, a small amount of information is recorded on your actual activities such as which page is viewed. This information is used to form an overall statistical picture of the site such as popular content, other Internet sites linked to and the types of web browsers being used to access the site. These logs may also be used to solve technical problems and to investigate abuse of the site, vandalism, harassment or other violation of the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/index.php?title=RxWiki:Terms_of_Use "RxWiki:Terms of Use").
