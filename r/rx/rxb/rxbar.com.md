# Privacy Policy | RXBAR

The RXBAR privacy and security measures are designed with the highest interest of our clients in mind, so any personal information that you provide to RXBAR is used for the purpose of personalizing and enhancing your web experience with RXBAR, and for no other purpose. RXBAR specific privacy policies are outlined below.

### The Information We Collect

There are three ways that RXBAR obtains information from you: (1) via registration on the RXBAR website; (2) from an online purchase; or (3) from any other form of direct purchase from RXBAR.

### How We Use The Information

The information obtained from registration online is utilized to improve your web experience with RXBAR by enabling you to obtain a faster checkout for purchases and/or to receive occasional e-mails which provide you with the latest and greatest information regarding RXBAR and its products.

The information we ask from you when ordering online is your name, address, phone number, credit card number, email address, etc. and is used only to complete the order, to confirm the order and to confirm shipment of the order. You may, upon placement of an order, opt to allow RXBAR to save the information for a speedier checkout process the next time. This information is then stored only for the purposes of faster checkout and is not used for any other purpose.

RXBAR does not otherwise utilize your personal information in any way and never shares or sells your e-mail address or other personal information to other companies. No information is collected about you unless you apply for registration or purchase products from us. "Cookies" (small bits of text that your web browser software stores on your computer when you visit certain websites) are used by RXBAR only to allow you to use RXBAR website in the most efficient manner.

### E-Mail

RXBAR will only send e-mails to you if you ask for them and you can easily unsubscribe at any time you do so choose. RXBAR has a strict company policy not to flood people with e-mail correspondence, but simply gives you periodic information so you can stay up to date on what RXBAR is offering. RXBAR also uses your e-mail address to confirm your order and to confirm shipment of your order and to respond to any inquiries you make on-line. All e-mails you receive will provide you with information as to how to get off the e-mail mailing list if you so desire.

### Children's Privacy

If you are under 18, you may use rxbar.com only with involvement of a parent or guardian. For their protection, RXBAR asks that anyone 13 years of age or younger not attempt to register with RXBAR or otherwise provide RXBAR with any personal information without the consent of a parent or legal guardian.

### Access To Your Personal Information

RXBAR will provide you with access to the personal information you provided to RXBAR by allowing you to view and modify the information we store related to you. In order to protect your privacy, RXBAR takes steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the private information or enabling you to make corrections. RXBAR will accomplish this through the use of passwords and personal data.

### Security

Our website's system is designed to monitor activity and prevent any unauthorized disclosure of credit card numbers or other personal information. In addition, we utilize a licensed system for credit card authorization and fraud detection. We use industry standard SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect the confidentiality of your personal information.

### Updates to Privacy Information

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post a new policy on our Site and change the date at the bottom of the policy. Therefore, we encourage you to check the date of our privacy policy whenever you visit this Site for any updates or changes.
