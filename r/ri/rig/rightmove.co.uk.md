We are registered under the Data Protection Act 1998, number Z4726900. We provide this website to subscribing estate agents and new homes developers to display properties they are marketing.

Information collection and use

Searching and viewing properties

When you use the site we anonymously record the details of the searches you make and the properties you look at. We make this data available to our member estate agents to help them monitor their properties performance on the site and to gauge market interest in their areas. This data is not personally identifiable i.e. we can't tell which properties you or any other person are looking at or have looked at.

The following features, by their nature, require and make use of personally identifiable information.

Sending emails

When you use the 'contact agent' forms on the site we record your answers to the questions. The information is sent to the agent you are contacting to help them provide a more personalised service. We also send the agent details of your last search to help them find property that matches your requirements more closely.

Email a Friend

When you use the 'email a friend' feature of the site we record which properties have been sent so we can track their popularity. We record the other details provided in the email for internal monitoring of the service but we will NOT add this information to our mailing lists to protect you and the recipient's privacy.

Registering with Rightmove.co.uk

If you [register](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/publicsite.PublicSiteLogin?rl=true) with Rightmove we save the details you provide (they are the same as are on the email forms). You can update your details at any time via the '[my details](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/RegistrationAction?update=true)' page on our site. When you are signed in, we automatically pre-fill your saved details on the contact agent forms.

Saving properties

We do not currently make this individual information available to our member agents or third parties.

Using the 'email updates'

If you [register](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/publicsite.PublicSiteLogin?rl=true) with Rightmove and use the 'email updates' feature to receive notification when new properties matching your criteria are added to the site, we record the settings you use and which properties have been sent to you. If you are signed in when you send an email to an agent, we include these settings to help them provide more personalised services to you. We do not currently make information about which properties have been sent to individuals available to our member agents or third parties.

Who has access to the information you provide or we collect

Rightmove has access to the information described above. We may aggregate the information to identify patterns which we can use in our marketing and to help us improve our services and features. When our service is available on other partner websites, our partners have access to information recorded from their site as described above, subject to their own privacy policies.

Rightmove, our partner websites (or the members you send emails to) may provide any of the information we collect to carefully screened third parties who may wish to inform you of appropriate products or services. If you do not want Rightmove, our members or partner websites to pass your information on to third parties, you can opt out using the privacy settings on the email forms or if you are a registered user, your '[my details](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/RegistrationAction?update=true)' page. 

We will not disclose your information to any other third party without your permission unless we are required to do so by law.

Registered users can update their information, change settings or cancel their membership on their '[my details](http://www.rightmove.co.uk/rm/action/RegistrationAction?update=true)' page once signed in.

Non-registered users can request we provide them with a copy of the personally identifiable information we hold via [talk-to-us@rightmove.co.uk](mailto:talk-to-us@rightmove.co.uk). We may charge a small administration fee to cover the data search, preparation and delivery.

Communications

From time to time Rightmove may need to send you emails, e.g. to confirm or remind you of your registration details. By registering you accept this can happen.

We'd also like to send you occasional emails with details of services or features we feel you would benefit from or to gather feedback. If you are a registered user you can opt-out of receiving these kinds of emails on your 'my details' page. For non-registered users you can opt out using the privacy settings on the emails forms. If you've already sent emails without opting out, you can ask us to remove your email address from our database by sending an email to [talk-to-us@rightmove.co.uk](mailto:talk-to-us@rightmove.co.uk).
