##### How Secure is My Information?

Notice that the "http" portion of the web site address in your browser changes to "https." The "s" stands for "secure." In addition, both Firefox and Internet Explorer use special symbols to indicate that you're in a web site's secure area. Recent versions of Firefox and all versions of Internet Explorer show a closed, highlighted lock. Some browsers let you know that you're moving in or out of a secure area by notifying you with a special pop-up window that requires you to click "ok" before continuing.

In addition, we encrypt every credit card number we store in our databases. Please see our Credit Card Security page for more about credit card safety.

Protecting your password: We also attempt to limit unauthorized access to your account. If you forget your password, you can create a new one. You can do your part to protect your personal information by keeping your password a secret and making sure you log off completely if you share a computer.

##### What about My Account?

Creating an account: Unlike many e-commerce sites, we don't require our customers to create an account and keep information on file with us. However, creating an account makes it even faster and easier to shop at our site.

Storing your credit card number: Do you want to keep your credit card information on file as part of Your Account? It's your decision. Your credit card number also helps us identify you if you forget your password and request a new one to access your account information.

If you don't want to keep your credit card information on file when you create an account, that's fine, you can re-enter your credit card number each time you checkout.
