# Letter from the CEO of RightBiz Enterprises

A Warm Welcome From   
RightBiz Enterprises!

Hi, 

My name is Stanley E. Kennedy, and I established RightBiz Enterprises in March 1999, with the intention of making a serious and permanent web presence for the purposes of re-selling quality goods and services, at the best possible price, to the International consumer. The website is also a base for information relating to Internet Marketing, Business Opportunities and the Web Resources required to develop a profitable site. 

Our main aim is customer satisfaction first, and profit second. We like to think of our site being the Right Business, in the Right place, at the Right Time. 

Below I've provided a brief explanation of our name, a no spam policy, and also because we ask visitors to join our mailing list we've provided a privacy statement to allay any fears that your contact details would be mis-used. 

OUR NAME 

Four creteria were used to create the name RightBiz. First the name had to be short and easy to remember, the business name and final registered domain name would have to be similar if not the same, the name would have to be appropriate for the intended sales and marketing content, finally the name would have to be available, i.e. un-registered as a business name or by Internic. 

Well we searched far and wide and came accross dozens of names we'd like to have used, although the domain names had already been registered with Internic. We eventually decided that if we took something as catchy and simple as "the right business" and condensed it, then we'd get rightbiz and add enterprises to the end of it to form RightBiz Enterprises would do perfectly. What's even better is that the domain name had not been taken and there was no business registered in the State with that name either. 

Spam Policy 

Spamming, such as sending unsolicated email or posting to off-topic USENET groups, is perceived by the vast majority of netizens as unprofessional, second rate and an utter nuisance. Therefore, RightBiz Enterprises has formed a strict policy against spamming of any description and none will be tolerated. 

Privacy Policy 

Part of conducting daily busines requires us to ask visitors for personal data when enrolling, placing an order, such as name and address, credit-card information, and e-mail address. We use this data only for the purpose of processing a request, order, or communicating with the customer on a status of an inquiry or order. We treat this customer information as private and confidential, and we will not disclose this information to other individuals or organizations unless required by law. We will not distribute customer information to be used in mailing lists, surveys, or any other purpose other than what is required to perform our services. We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of our customers' personal data. 

External Links 

RightBiz.com contains links to other Web sites. RightBiz Enterprises is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

If you have any problems with or suggestions for the site please e-mail or fax us. It is our intention to make this site easy to use and of greatest benefit to you. 

Best Regards, 

Stanley E. Kennedy   
CEO, RightBiz Enterprises.   
28 June 1999
