If you know the terms of skateboarding then you already know what a "manual" is but for those of us who aren't familiar, it's similar to a bike wheelie where the two front wheels are off the ground. Swiss skateboarder Simon Stricker cruises down the road with nothing but his back wheels for 1.35 miles in this [Red Bull](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCblfuW_4rakIf2h6aqANefA) video.

Foxes are known for being clever and sneaky. One fox, however, didn't seem to get that memo. He got his cute little head stuck in a not-so-cute chain link fence. Some good samaritans found the fox, got out the bolt cutter, and managed to set the fox free. Speaking of stuck animals, an antelope wasn't running wild and free so much as it was flailing and getting trapped in barbed wire fencing. Luckily for the antelope, local resident Bret Lee stopped by and was able to lend a hand. He helped free the antelope, who seemed a little embarrassed that it got stuck in the first place.
