###  [Thrilling Overnight Challenge In Abandoned Hospital](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-thrilling-overnight-challenge-abandoned-hospital)

YouTubers do some pretty wacky challenges — and all for the views. [The FAM](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSCuCzQIFeYe6bs20-YUdw) has decided to do something entirely crazy and we don't recommend it. He's in Miami Gardens, Florida at three in the morning about to stroll through the former Parkway West Hospital. It's a complete abandoned mess and some might even argue haunted. We could speculate it very well might be — based on the spooky things he encounters during his time there.

Here's something you probably didn't expect to feel today, sympathy for a spider. When Chris and his buddies found a wolf spider, he figured that it was trying to start a fight. We think the spider was actually trying to start a web, but still, Chris decided to end the fight by...eating his opponent. Super gross and totally not cool, Chris! via [Viral Hog](https://www.facebook.com/YA.BOYY.231/videos/10216855535399647/) [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-dude-thinks-spider-snack)

The dreaded folded sheet is creating closet messes everywhere — why can't we figure it out! [Terri Metz](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp5l87bM-Csl-VqLbyojDUA) is here to help, so no need to fear! First, you put your legs in two corners, then lay down and put your arms into the other corners, roll to one side, ease your way out, and BOOM! You're done! We love this chick's method. Honestly, it looks fun. So much fun that Gayle and Charity had to give it a try.   [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-teach-us-how-fold-fitted-sheet-terri)

The [Stanley Hotel](https://www.facebook.com/thestanleyhotel/) in Estes Park, Colorado is home to a lot of scary things, but bears are not usually one of them. The famously haunted hotel that inspired Stephen King to write "The Shining" became a nice staycation destination for this black bear when it wandered into the hotel lobby. The person working the front desk was lucky to get this on camera, but then again, they've probably seen way scarier.  [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/bear-wanders-shining-hotel)

At Pilanesberg National Park in South Africa, you can get really close to the wildlife. Like, _really_ close! Folks on safari were lucky enough to see a leopard hunting for its lunch. Despite the fact that the leopard seemed to miss out on a meal, the onlookers had a once-in-a-lifetime experience. via [Kruger National Park](https://www.youtube.com/user/exRanger7) [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-leopard-hunt-right-outside-your-car)

Thanks to an alert by a resident in San Clemente del Tuyú, Argentina, a rescue crew was quickly able to help a young humpback whale tangled in fishing nets. With 70 percent of its body out of the water, they took advantage of the low-tide — braving the brutal elements the whole way through.

Tommy the dog got himself stuck between two narrow garage walls in Russia. The heat was intense and with no food, rescuers didn't have a lot of time. Firefighters needed permission to break into one of the garages and knock out a hole in the wall to reach the pup. It took a while but the effort was certainly worth it. Now Tommy is back home and safe with his favorite human! via [Viral Video UK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zML4ffk7-w) [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-breaking-down-walls-doggie-rescue)

Time away from those you love can feel like an eternity. This can certainly be said for 53-year-old Matt and his father. Matt went to New York City for five days with his sister and although he had a great time, he couldn't wait to get back home to dad! Let's be honest, being surprised with a pet is one of life's greatest joys. Ewan Bamford would most definitely agree! Happy birthday, Ewan!

When Blossom was first found, she didn't really know how to be a normal dog. The pooch was rescued from a horrifying hoarding situation, and when she first came home with foster dad Rocky Kanaka, she couldn't stop shaking and hiding.

We've seen it before — the animals of South Africa aren't always in the mood for tourists or safari vehicles. In this buffalo's case, it certainly was not having any kind of tourist activity. The animal repeatedly rams into the open-sided vehicle until the guide is safely able to drive away. [View Now](https://web.archive.org/video/rtmtv-take-your-safari-elsewhere)
