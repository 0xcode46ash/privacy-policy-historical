### Important Matters That Deserve Your Prayerful Consideration

We are delighted that you have decided to join us as we seek to participate in God’s work in nations around the world. While recent events have certainly caused us to reexamine the nature and depth of our own commitment to our mission, they have also served to emphasize the enormity of the need for the message of God’s Grace around the world. 

While we are confident of God’s call on our lives to continue our work in other countries, we want to be sure that in deciding to go, you have thoughtfully and prayerfully “counted the cost” in arriving at your decision to “Go.” Our desire is that your decision is a thoughtful one, taking into account all relevant information available in light of God’s call on your life and His promise to be with us as we make disciples of the nations. (Matthew 28:18 – 20) This would include any information concerning special risks that may apply to the time and location of your travel. 

We can not make this decision for you or anyone else. This is your decision to make before God. You may recall that Jesus rebuked Peter for asking about John’s calling when Jesus had told Peter: “Follow me.” We are all unique with unique callings. How the risk of a certain situation might determine your decision to go or not is for you to assess. 

By requesting information through the Rightnow.org website or The Rightnow Campaign, you are agreeing to the following: 

> I understand that travel, particularly for mission purposes, may involve significant risks and that travel to some areas of the world involves greater health and safety risks than foreign travel in general. I understand that it is my sole responsibility to gather whatever information I need in order to assess the risk involved in any travel, stay or other activity. My participation in any such activity means that I have to my full satisfaction obtained all information necessary for me to assess the risk and to participate willingly.

If you need any help in getting information to help you make a decision, please let us know. A good place to start is the web site of the U.S. State Department at <http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/tw/tw_1764.html> and the country information that it includes. Or you can call them at 202.647.5225. Please read and consider all the material carefully. 

As always we want to serve you as you seek to discern what your piece of the Great Commission task is, and then as you step out in faith to be obedient to God’s call. Thank you for allowing us to serve you as you serve Jesus.
