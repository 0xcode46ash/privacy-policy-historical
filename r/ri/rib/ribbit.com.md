Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. The information we collect is not sold, lent, rented, or otherwise shared with other organizations for any purpose. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

### What kinds of voluntary information do you gather?

Our site and email communications may contain links to subscribe, or opt in, and receive special information and publications. For example, we may sponsor an email newsletter, and you may subscribe to this email and other communications from Ribbit. Any communication we send will contain an option to opt out of future communications. 

Ribbit may occasionally conduct user surveys to better target our content to our audience. We sometimes share the aggregated demographic information in these surveys with our sponsors, advertisers, and partners. We never share any of this information about specific individuals with any third party. 

### What other types of information do you gather?

Information Ribbit gathers through aggregated tracking information is derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs. Under no circumstances does Ribbit divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

Ribbit tracks user traffic patterns throughout our sites. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. does break down overall usage statistics according to a user's domain name, browser type, and MIME type by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser). 

Ribbit sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms users enter in our Search function, but this tracking is never associated with individual users. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. 

### What are "cookies" and how do you use them?

We may place a text file called a "cookie" in the browser files of your computer. The cookie itself does not contain personal information, although it will enable us to relate your use of this site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. The only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data from your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Ribbit may use cookies to track user traffic patterns (as described above). 

### I'd rather not be cookied. Can I turn them off?

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use this site. 

### What is your policy on underage users?

Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without requesting parental consent. 

### What if I need to contact you?
