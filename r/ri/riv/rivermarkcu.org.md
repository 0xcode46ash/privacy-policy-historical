 **Online Privacy Protections**

Rivermark Community Credit Union collects and stores information on the domain you use to access its Web site, the Internet address of the site from which you linked directly to its site, and the date and time of your visit to its Web site. This information is used to measure the number of visitors to the various pages on the Web site, to help the credit union make improvements to the information contained in the site, and to better serve our members through special marketing and service programs. To protect the information you provide us online, we use multiple levels of security. The application information we accept online and our Online Banking service rely on industry standard "Secure Socket Layer" (SSL) encryption to secure your transaction information and communication. When you visit our Web site, you can access site information, without revealing your personal identity. Personal identifying information is collected when a member registers to access the Online Banking sections of the Website. This information lets the credit union regulate entry to these portions that are reserved for access only by our members and to measure member usage. Personal identifying information is also collected in our online registration to access our online auction service. Any personal identification information gathered during the registration process is not disclosed or sold to third parties.

**E-Mail.** Personal information contained in e-mail sent by members and non-members may be used by the credit union to answer questions, follow up on suggestions or complaints, or to improve the level of service the credit union provides. Please be advised that e-mail may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, if you wish to communicate sensitive or personal information, you may want to send it by regular mail.

**Cookies.** Some parts of the credit union's Web site may use a "cookie," which is a file placed on your computer hard drive that allows our Web site server to log the pages you use in the site and to determine if you have visited the site before. The cookie captures no personal identification information. The server uses this information to provide certain features during your visit to the Web site. You can set your browser to warn you when placement of a cookie is requested, and decide whether to accept it. By rejecting a cookie, some of the features available on the site may not function properly.

**External Links.** Our Web site contains links to other sites. Rivermark Community Credit Union is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by our Web site. Some of the links from our site will take you off the rivermarkcu.org site to a "co-branded" site where you will see the Rivermark Community Credit Union logo as well as the logo of another service provider. Co-branded Web sites may include Members Financial Services, and Verified by VISA, and may change from time to time. The service provider collects any information that you provide. You are encouraged to read the privacy statement of that provider.

**Children's Information Privacy.** The financial services offered through our Web site are not directed toward children under age 13. We do not knowingly solicit or collect information from children, and we do not knowingly market to children online without express parental consent or notification. If we receive online information from any child, we will only use the information to respond directly to a child's request. We recognize that protecting children's identities and online privacy is important and that responsibility rests with us and with parents.
