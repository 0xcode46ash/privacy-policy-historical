## Privacy Statement for Rivals.com

Rivals.com, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for all Rivals.com-affiliated Web sites. 

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information. We will not provide or sell user-specific demographic information to any other person or business. We will only share this information on an aggregate basis. 

Our site uses cookies (user data collectors) to keep track of your shopping cart. We use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site, and for other purposes.

**_Advertising_**

Rivals.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.

Advertisements served by DoubleClick appear on pages throughout this Web site. DoubleClick utilizes certain technologies to deliver specific advertisements to visitors to this site. Privacy issues surrounding this technology are disclosed in their privacy policy, which can be viewed at [www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy). 

**_Registration Form_**

Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and email address) and demographic information (like their zip code, age, gender or income level). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the selected user information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data for other purposes, such as tailoring the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared with advertisers, but ONLY on an aggregate basis. We will NEVER share your address and personal data with any advertiser unless you specifically opt-in to one of our/their programs (a sweepstakes, for example). The choice to specifically identify yourself to an advertiser will always be yours. We will occasionally email you items of interest from some of our advertisers. You will have the opportunity to opt-out of such programs, and once again, your email name and personal information are never shared with those advertisers unless you choose to identify yourself to them by participating in offers that interest you. 

This site contains links to other sites. **Rivals.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**_Order Form_**

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (like their email address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, gender or income level). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders, information about our company, and promotional material from some of our partners to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared by Rivals.com with advertisers only on an aggregate basis. 

**_Contests_**

We run contests on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (like their email address), financial information (like their account or credit card numbers), and demographic information (like their zip code, age, gender or income level). We use contact data from our contests to send users information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Financial information that is collected from our users is used to bill the user for products and services. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor our visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. This information is shared by Rivals.com with advertisers on an aggregate basis. Unless the user opts-out in the contest registration process, he has identified himself to advertisers and marketing partners and this information is not necessarily used in aggregate. 

We use an outside advertising company to display ads on our site. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad company, and we do not have access to this information.
