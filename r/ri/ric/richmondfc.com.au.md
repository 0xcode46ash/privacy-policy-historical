Introduction
The Richmond Football Club respects the privacy of personal information that it collects from its
Supporter and Membership Services and is committed to managing that information in an
accurate and responsible manner.
The Richmond Football Club is covered by the Privacy Act 1988 and its ten National Privacy

correct or update it.
This Privacy Policy summarises how we adhere to the NPPs.
NPP 1 Collection
The Richmond Football Club will only collect personal information that is required to service your
Supporter and Membership needs. The club does not seek to collect information that will not
enhance your time as a member or supporter of the club, nor shall it be intrusive during collection
time in any manner.
The Richmond Football Club collects information that identifies you, such as your name, address

participate in a football clinic. The club may use this data as prospecting data for future use. In
such situations, this shall be clearly stated during collection time.
