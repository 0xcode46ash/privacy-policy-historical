We need to collect and process personal information about you including your name, gender, birth date and so forth. 

We may ask you for this information through our Sites, or via one of our service centre operators, or we may collect this information through your email or other communications with us. 

Certain information is collected automatically, as described later in this Privacy Policy.

Although we do not make it compulsory to give us every item of information we ask for, the more information you volunteer (and the more accurate it is), the better we can tailor our services for you.

We also collect information from you if you choose to take part in any of our surveys. We use this information to help us plan promotional campaigns.

Certain RICS services, such as the RICS Directory, are offered in conjunction with our business partners. 

In such cases, we may need to share your personal information with them in order to provide these services. 

Please note that certain services may be unavailable if you do not want to disclose the personal information you are asked for.

**Log files and IP addresses**  
When you visit our Sites, we automatically log your IP address (the unique address which identifies your computer on the internet) which is automatically recognised by our web server. We use IP addresses to help us administer our Sites and collect broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

Anonymous user data is collected on a monthly basis for us by WebtraffiQ ( **[www.webtraffiq.com](http://www.webtraffiq.com/)** )

**Non personal information  
** We may automatically collect non-personal information about you such as the type of internet browsers you may use or the site from which you linked to our Sites. 

You cannot be identified from this information and it is only used to assist us in providing an effective service from our Sites.

We may from time to time supply the owners or operators of third party sites from which it is possible to link to our Sites with information relating to the number of users linking to our Sites from their sites. 

You cannot be identified from this information.

**Information placed on your computer  
** We may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer when you look at our Sites. 

This information facilitates your use of our Sites and helps us to provide you with the best level of service. 

For example, cookies ensure that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you order from us or visit our restricted member access site and help us to show you advertisements which are relevant to your interests.

You can erase or block cookies from your computer if you want to (your help screen or manual should tell you how to do this), but certain RICS services may not work correctly or at all if you set your browser not to accept cookies.

**Disclosing your information to others  
** Other than the disclosures referred to here, we will not disclose any personal information without your permission unless we are legally entitled or obliged to do so (for example, if required to do so by Court order or for the purposes of prevention of fraud or other crime).

**Information about products and services  
** It is very important to us that we provide the highest level of service. 

In order to help us do this, from time to time, RICS companies may send you details of products and services which we think may be of interest to you. 

In addition, from time to time, RICS companies may share the information you supply to us with selected third parties to enable them to send you information which may be of interest to you. 

Member data may also be used to provide mailing lists to selected and relevant third party suppliers for direct marketing. 

These member lists are selected on the basis of professional specialisation, location, company size etc.
