**Richmeetbeautiful Holding Ltd** **. Privacy Policy**

Richmeetbeautiful Holding Ltd. ("Company" or "we") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it through compliance with this privacy policy. This policy describes the types of information we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit the RichMeetBeautiful® websites and mobile application, including but not limited to https://www.richmeetbeautiful.ie (collectively our "Website" or "RichMeetBeautiful") and our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting and disclosing that information.

Please read this privacy policy carefully to understand our policies and practices regarding your information and how we will treat it. If you do not agree with our policies and practices, your choice is not to use our Website. By accessing or using this Website, you agree to this privacy policy. This policy may change from time to time (see Changes to our Privacy Policy, below). Your continued use of this Website after we make changes is deemed to be acceptance of those changes, so please check the policy periodically for updates.

**Scope**

This privacy policy applies to information we collect: on the Website; in e-mail, text and other electronic messages between you and the Website; and through mobile and desktop applications you download from this Website. This policy does not apply to information collected by: us offline or through any other means, including on any other website operated by the Company or any third party such as a social media site; or any third party (including our affiliates or subsidiaries), including through any application or content (including advertising) that may link to or be accessible from or on the Website.

**Information We Collect and How we Collect It**

We collect several types of information from and about users of our Website, including information that can identify you such as your name and e-mail address ("personal information") and other information that is about you but individually does not identify you. We collect this information: directly from you when you provide it to us and; automatically as you navigate through the Website.

**Information you provide to us.**

We may collect and store any personal information you enter on the Website. This includes information, such as your name, address, email address, and telephone number, and, if you transact business with us, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information). We may also collect information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information such as your hometown or your username.

The email address you provide during account registration will not be visible or otherwise available to other users. We nonetheless encourage all of our members and users to create an anonymous separate email account. This will help secure your privacy when using this Website.

If you choose to upload an image to your profile, there is a risk of being recognized and linked to your real identity. We therefore advise you to use photos that do not show your face fully or to use out unique AnonymousBlurTM feature to make your face unrecognizable in the photos you choose to upload. This will maintain your anonymous identity while at the same time allowing users to get an impression of your physical appearance.

When you pay via the Website, the Company and sites other than the card processor cannot access your bank account or credit card number. RichMeetBeautiful does not store any credit card sensitive information, and uses Payex which is a leading professional payment service for online transaction. Your Payex account is secured by BBS ePay.

**Information we collect automatically.**

We automatically collect information from your browser or device when you visit our Website or application. This information may include your IP address, device ID, your browser type and language, access times, the content of any undeleted cookies that your browser previously accepted from us and the referring website address. The technologies we use for this automatic information collection may include Cookies (See "Cookies and Usage Reports" below).

**Cookies and Usage Reports**

By placing a small file known as a "cookie" on your computer (or other device), we and our third party service providers passively gather information about your use of the Website for several reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: statistics collection and analysis, Website optimization, analytics (as described below), market research, and maintenance of user login information. The information that we and our third party service providers track with cookies includes, but is not limited to, the type of browser (such as Google Chrome or Internet Explorer) and Internet-connected device being used to access the Website, your Internet protocol ("IP") address, your home domain or Internet service provider, your referrer URL (which is the URL for the website that you were viewing prior to visiting the Website), how you were directed to the Website, which specific pages you access on the Website, how long you view each page, the time and date you access our Website and the total number of visitors to the Website and any portions thereof. We use your IP address to determine the general physical location of your computer or device and understand from what geographic locations our Website visitors come.

We, and/or our third party service providers, may place cookies or similar files on your computer for security purposes (such as authentication), to facilitate site navigation and to personalize your experience while visiting our Website. Cookies allow us and our third party service providers to collect technical and navigational information, such as browser type, time spent on our Website and pages visited (these types of cookies are typically referred to as "Session Cookies").

Our third party service providers use pixels which cause "cookies" or similar technology to be stored on your browsers when you visit the Website. This is necessary for our third party service providers to provide retargeting services. The collection of this anonymous data allows us to better target our advertising to your interests. The data also helps us and our third party service providers improve our respective product and services. You can opt out of this tracking at any time by following the instructions below in the section called "Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information."

Most popular Internet browser applications will allow you to configure the browser so as not to accept cookies. However, setting your browser to reject cookies may, in certain instances, prevent you from taking full advantage of the Website (or some portion thereof) and its capabilities, or cause some features of the Website to function improperly or more slowly. If there are any problems related to "Cookies", you may be told to change your security settings. Consult your user manual for instructions on adjusting your browser settings.

The Website uses Google Analytics (a web analysis service provided by Google, in order to better understand your use of our Website and how we can improve the Website. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit a Website, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other websites they used prior to coming to such Website. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Websites, rather than your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with your personal information. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit a Website, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to the Website is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy. Google utilizes the data collected to track and examine the use of the Website, to prepare reports on its activities and share them with other Google services. Google may use the data collected on the Website to contextualize and personalize the ads of its own advertising network. To more fully understand how Google may use the data it collects on the Website, please review "How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps", (located here or any successor URL). If you would like additional information regarding the security and privacy practices of Google’s Universal Analytics feature, please review the materials provided by Google here.

Some of the areas of the Website may contain electronic images known as web beacons (sometimes known as clear gifs) that allow the Company and its third party providers or affiliates, to count and track users who have visited certain portions of the Website. Web beacons collect only limited information, including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the Web beacon resides. Certain features of our Website may use local stored objects (of Flash Cookies) to collect and store information about your preferences and navigation to, and from, our Website. Flash cookies are not managed by the same browser settings as used for browser cookies. For more information about managing the privacy and security settings of Flash cookies, see Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Personal Information: Tracking Technologies and Advertising.
