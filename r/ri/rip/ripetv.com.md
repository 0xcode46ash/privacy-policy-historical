####  III. Information Collection and Use 

Ripe collects PI when you register with Ripe, when you visit certain Ripe pages and when you deliver communications or content to the Site. Ripe may combine information about you that Ripe has with information we obtain from business associates or otherwise. Without limitation, information collected, including PI, may be used by Ripe for internal research purposes, marketing, promotions and public relations, subject only to the terms of Ripe's privacy policy. 

Ripe will not disclose, transfer, sell or otherwise communicate your PI to any third party, other than Ripe's parent, subsidiaries, affiliates, successors, assigns, and licensees and each of their officers, directors, employees and vendors and contractors operating under confidentiality agreements and subject to Ripe's privacy policy, unless you give Ripe permission to do so, except as set forth in this privacy policy. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary, Ripe may disclose any information you provide if required to do so by law or pursuant to a request by law enforcement or if Ripe has a good faith belief that disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with the law or with the legal process; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Ripe or third parties; or (c) act in an emergency to protect someone's safety or legal rights ("Mandatory Disclosures"). Ripe may buy or sell assets or change its name or form of entity, and, depending upon the transaction, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets in which case Ripe reserves the right to sell or transfer your PI. Ripe will notify you before PI about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

To help administer the Site, Ripe does collect technology-related information. "Technology-Related Information" may include , but is not limited to the following: source IP address, domain name, date and time visited and visited pages.

The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major websites use them. Your browser has options to accept, reject or provide you with notice when a cookie is sent. Ripe uses cookies for many purposes such as to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Ripe also uses cookies to deliver content (which may include third party advertisements) specific to your interests. Ripe may set and access Ripe "cookies" on your computer. Ripe lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Ripe's cookies.

Accordingly, Ripe cannot and does not guarantee that the individual user information you have transmitted, including PI, will not be intercepted by others and/or decrypted or accidentally disclosed. Ripe cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted over the Internet, and Ripe accepts no liability for any unintentional disclosure. 

####  VI. Modifications to the Privacy Policy 

Ripe's privacy policy may change from time to time at its sole discretion. If Ripe decides to make any material changes, Ripe will post these changes on the Site. If, at any point, Ripe decides to use PI in a manner different than what was stated at the time it was collected, Ripe will notify users of this change via e-mail. Users will have a choice as to whether or not Ripe can use their information in this different manner. Ripe will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected unless you agree otherwise. 

####  VII. Note to Parents of Minors 

In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), Ripe is a general audience site and does not intend to collect any PI from children under 18 years of age, unless Ripe believes such collection to be permitted by law. The Site targets an audience that is 18 years of age or older and some content may not be appropriate for all ages. Parental supervision is recommended. If you are the pa rent or guardian of a child under 18 and believe that he or she has disclosed PI to Ripe, please contact info@ripe.tv. Upon request, the parent or guardian of a child under the age of 18 may review and request the deletion of such child's PI, as well as refuse to permit the further collection or use of such PI.
