## Returns & Exchanges

  1. ### Make Sure Your Order Qualifies

Orders may be returned so long as:

    * The order is new, unused/unworn, and unopened
    * The order is returned within 15 days of receipt
    * The order was not purchased on final sale

__Personalized, made to order frames,_  fabric, and other custom products are subject to a different return policy. Please [contact us](https://riflepaperco.com/contact/) if you are unsure whether your order qualifies for a refund._

  2. ### Return Your Order & Packing Slip

Send your order, along with its original packing slip, to:

> **RIFLE PAPER CO.  
>  **Attn: Returns  
>  133 Atlantic Drive Nº 1020  
>  Maitland, FL 32751 USA

If you are looking to make an exchange for an item of equal or lesser value, please note which item(s) you would like to receive on your original packing slip.

Please keep the tracking number and any other relevant shipping information in the unlikely event we do not receive your return shipment.

  3. ### Await Credit

Once a qualified refund is received we will process your refund as soon as possible. The charges placed on your card will be credited to you, though shipping costs are non-refundable.

_Please note that refunds may take up to ten (10) business days to show on your account  due to varying processing times between payment providers. If for any reason you do not receive the credited amount within that time frame, please feel free to [contact us](https://riflepaperco.com/contact/)._




## Shipping / Payment

Payment Methods
    

At this time we are accepting Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Discover. If you would like to get in touch with us about a different billing method please feel free to [contact us](https://riflepaperco.com/contact/ "Contact"). Payments are processed by _Square_ or _Paypal_ , depending on the option selected during checkout.

Sales Tax
    

We are not required to collect sales tax on any orders outside the states of Florida and New York.

Shipping & Fulfillment
    

Rifle Paper Co. currently ships all orders with either FedEx or USPS from our shipping and fulfillment warehouse in Maitland, FL.

International Shipping
    

We currently offer FedEx options for international orders. Rifle Paper Co. is not responsible for any customs fees or duties incurred on international shipments as these are the responsibility of the purchaser. We strongly recommend using International First or Priority methods if you need your package to arrive in a time sensitive manner. Please note, however, even with these shipping methods, transit times may vary due to customs delays. International Standard, while an affordable method, may vary in transit time and reliability depending on your own country's postal system.

Personalized Order Processing
    

Personalized orders typically take about 2–3 weeks to process and ship. If your order is time sensitive please [contact us](https://riflepaperco.com/contact/) before placing your order. If you order additional store products they will be shipped at the same time as the personalized goods. Please see the product descriptions for more information.

Returns & Exchanges
    

Unused and unopened orders may be returned within 15 days of receipt for a refund. Once we receive the returned item(s) the charges will be credited to you (though shipping costs are non-refundable). Used, opened, and/or final sale items cannot be returned. This does not apply for personalized orders.

Personalized orders are non-refundable after order confirmation. Upon final approval of your personalized order we cannot accept returns due to any and all errors (such as misspelled words etc.). By approving your final proof you accept responsibility for the information and layout as shown. If errors are discovered after proof approval, we are required to charge for a reprint.

Made to order frames are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged. If you have questions about your frame order, please contact us right away.

Fabric orders are non-refundable and cannot be exchanged. If you have questions about the fabric, please contact us right away.

Lost Packages
    

If you have a package that was marked as delivered but you have not yet received it, we ask you take the following steps:

  * Check with your neighbors or front office (if applicable) to see if the package was left there
  * Reach out to your local post office or FedEx facility.
  * Contact our team at help@riflepaperco.com and include your order number.



We kindly ask that you report your lost or stolen shipment within 10 days of the marked delivery date. If an order is lost after being shipped to a third party mail forwarding facility, we are unable to assume responsibility of the package once it is marked as delivered. Once an international shipment has been marked as ‘delivered,’ we are no longer responsible for the particular package.

_Please note, Rifle Paper Co. is not responsible for refunding or reshipping lost orders due to an incorrect address at checkout._
