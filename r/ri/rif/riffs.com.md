# Riffs: Your Social Recommender - Ratings, Rants, Raves, and Reviews

The following statement is about our uses of personal information you may submit to us in relation to your use of riffs.com. Here is what we do and how we do it: 

## Information we may collect from you:

riffs.com may collect information from you in the following ways: 

  * through information that you tell us directly (your name, age, e-mail, etc.)
  * through riffs and reviews that you write
  * through cookies
  * through click streams and log files (how and when you visit the site, what parts of the site you visit, etc.) and 
  * through keeping track of your searches and search results, as well as what we give you as search results (we don't do this yet, but we might!)



Cookies:   
A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer tied to information about you. We may use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once you close your browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on your hard drive for an extended period of time. Persistent cookies can be removed by following Internet browser help file directions. 

By setting a cookie, you will not have to log in with a password more than once. We store a cookie on each user's machine that contains a username and encrypted password. 

Some of our business partners may use cookies on riffs.com (for example, advertisers). We have no access to or control over these cookies once we have given permission for them to set cookies for advertising. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by riffs.com only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. 

Third Party Advertising 

The ads appearing on riffs.com are delivered to users by Google, among other services. Information about users' visits to riffs.com, such as number of times they have viewed an ad (but not your username or any other personal information), is used to serve ads to users on this site. For more information about Google and cookies, please [click here](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html). 

Log Files 

Like most commercial website servers, riffs.com uses log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We may use a tracking utility that uses log files to analyze user movement. 

## What we do with that information, and why:

  * Our primary reason for collecting this information is to enhance site performance and user experience. By seeing what areas of the site are frequently used, for example, we can make those areas richer or more prominent. We will not sell your personal information. We may make information available to third parties, but that information will never be personal: it will always be aggregated, anonymous information. In other words, any information that we share with third parties will not personally identify you, or link your activities to your name.
  * Your email address will only be used for the following things: 
    * to send you a link for resetting your password, if you have forgotten the password and request an email.
    * if you submit feedback and specifically request that we respond via email.
    * when you email riffs pages, including item pages or your profile page, to other people (your email address will appear as the "from" address in those emails).
  * Your phone number will be used only for the features of riffs.com that involve SMS. All of these features will be initiated by you, on a case-by-case basis; you will never receive unsolicited messages. Your phone number will never be visible to any third party or any other riffs user.
  * Certain information that you submit, including your picture, username and riffs and reviews, will be displayed to other users. We include your first name, if you've entered it, when you request that emails be sent to others (e.g., emailing item pages). Your phone number and e-mail information will not be displayed to other users.



Legal Disclaimer 

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, riffs.com may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on riffs.com. 

Business Transitions 

In the event riffs.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. 

Links 

riffs.com may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices any other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by us. 

Notification of Changes 

Whenever we change our privacy policy for riffs.com, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, and other places we deem appropriate so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

Chat Rooms, Journals and WebLogs, Message Boards, Classifieds and Public Forums 

Please be aware that whenever you voluntarily post public information to Journals, WebLogs, Message Boards, Classifieds or any other Public Forums that that information can be accessed by the public and can in turn be used by those people to send you unsolicited communications. 

## What are your options about your personal information?

As a riffs.com user, you control the information that we know about you. You can use many riffs.com features without giving us any identifying personal information. You may also modify or remove any of your personal information at any time by logging into your account and accessing features such as edit preferences.
