### Privacy Statement from RIA

**General**  
Research Institute of America ("RIA") respects the privacy of every individual who visits our website. This Privacy Policy outlines the information RIA may collect and how it may use that information. 

**Personal Data**   
RIA does not automatically collect personally identifiable information from each visitor through our site. We do recognize and collect IP address, browser type, ISP, referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, number of clicks, using domain name of the website from which you linked to our site, and country/state. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the site, track visitor's movement, and analyze broad demographic trends. 

When you view our website, we may store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a "Cookie" or similar file and can help us in many ways. For example, Cookies allow us to tailor a website to better match your interest and preferences. The use of cookies is relatively standard and you will likely find them used on most other major Web sites. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. With most Internet Browsers, you can erase Cookies from your computer hard drive, block all Cookies or receive a warning before a Cookie is stored. Please refer to your Browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. 

In some areas of our site, we ask you to provide personally identifiable information. The personal information you provide will be kept confidential and used to support your interactions with RIA. 

**Registration**  
During registration a visitor is required to provide us with specific personal information. The information requested may vary depending on the service being registered for. This information is used to notify the visitor about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the visitor to provide demographic information such as practice area or type of firm, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Newsletters and Special Promotions**  
If a visitor wishes to subscribe to our newsletters and special promotions, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. RIA will not sell, share, or rent this information, for commercial purposes, to any person or organization outside the Thomson Legal & Regulatory Group. 

**Purchases**  
RIA will request name, address, and financial information to facilitate your online purchase. This information is strictly confidential. Financial information is only used for billing purposes and to complete customers' orders. 

**Information requests**  
Questions and requests for information about RIA products and services will be retained for follow up with individuals in addressing their specific inquiries. RIA may also contact you by mail or telephone regarding information on new products and services related to that request. 

Circumstances may arise where RIA is legally required to disclose personal information to third parties such as in connection with a corporate divestiture or dissolution, or governmental investigations. 

**Choice/Opt-out**  
RIA may send you information about our various products and services. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, you may tell us when you register. Visitors and customers who no longer wish to receive our special e-mail promotions or newsletters may opt-out of receiving these communications by clicking on the unsubscribe link within the e-mail. 

**Notification of Changes**  
From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future we will post and highlight the policy changes in our privacy policy on the RIA Thomson website. You will have the ability to opt out of these new uses. 

**Security**  
Personal information is handled with the same quality of care as all RIA information to ensure the integrity and security of your data. When we ask users to provide sensitive information (such as credit card number or Social Security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology. While on a secure page such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of your Web browser becomes locked. You can also identify the secure connection by looking at the URL, which will begin with https: (instead of http:).
