# Privacy Policy - Ria Money Transfer

Last Updated: October 23, 2006

Welcome to Ria Money Transfer’s ("Ria") website, www.riamoneytransfer.com. Protecting your privacy is very important to us. Therefore the intent of this policy is to inform you about our collection and use of your personal and nonpersonal information. This policy is applicable to all Ria consumers and visitors who visit our website. [www.riamoneytransfer.com](https://www.riamoneytransfer.com/index.aspx)

##  Personal Information

In order to provide services, Ria collects and may disclose certain personal and nonpersonal information about you and the recipient of the fund transfer, such as name, address, and phone number. In addition, depending on the services requested and/or the amount of your money transfer, Ria may also collect and disclose personal and nonpersonal information, such as date of birth, social security number or other identifying number (including type, issuer, and expiration date), credit card information (including type, number and expiration date), and any other information necessary to verify and process the request. 

In addition, web log information is automatically gathered every time you visit the website. It gathers nonpersonal identifying information such as Internet browser type, IP address, and the pages you visited (see the use of "cookies" below).

##  Cookies

A cookie is a piece of text information that a web server may transfer to your web browser when you visit this website. Cookies are commonly used by websites to improve your experience and to enable systems to recognize your browsers. Only the information that you provide, or the choices you make while visiting a website, can be stored in a cookie. For example, the site cannot determine your e-mail name unless you choose to type it. Allowing a website to create a cookie does not give that or any other site access to the rest of your computer and only the site that created the cookie can interpret it. 

We may use cookies for a variety of purposes: to assist us in providing our services to you, to allow you to change pages during your visit to our website without reentering your password, to track activity on our website, or to determine whether you came to our site from an affiliate website.

##  Use of Information

Ria does not disclose nonpublic personal information about its consumers or former consumers to anyone, except as permitted by law. The law permits disclosure of nonpublic personal information, for example, where it is necessary to effect, administer, or enforce a transaction requested or authorized by the consumer, or in connection with the servicing or processing of a financial product or service requested or authorized by the consumer. The law also permits such sharing where it is released to protect the confidentiality or security of our records pertaining to our consumers, the services or products we offer, or the transactions we process or handle. The law also allows for the release of nonpublic personal information to protect against or prevent actual or potential fraud, identity theft, unauthorized transactions, claims or other liability, as well as for resolving consumer disputes or inquiries. The law further allows the release and/or disclosure of nonpublic personal information to comply with federal, state or local laws or regulations or other legal requirements, such as subpoenas or other legal processes. This list of examples of the types of sharing of information that is permitted by law is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather provides you with some basic information on some of the types of sharing permitted by law. 

Ria does not sell or exchange consumer lists or consumer information.

##  Safeguards to Protect Privacy

Ria takes precautions to protect the information of our customers. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards in an effort to secure your nonpublic personal information. When you enter sensitive or private consumer information, the information is encrypted and protected. Ria's database of consumer information resides on Ria's servers behind various firewalls to protect against loss, misuse, theft, and unauthorized modification, deletion, or alteration of the information contained in the database. 

Ria has taken preventative measures to restrict access to sensitive data and private information. Only those employees and agents who need to know that information to provide services related to the processing of fund transfers are granted access to personal information. Although Ria measures conform to those of the industry, Ria makes no claim or warranty as to the security or impenetrability of Ria's system under unusual circumstances or its resilience to future sophisticated attacks.
