We collect information from our customers which may include personal information related to the users of our customer's services. Such information may include a user's IP address, username, user ID, pages viewed, items viewed, items purchased, transaction information (such as price, billing method, address). Our customers integrate our Platform on their websites which enables us to facilitate the collection of the information necessary to provide our fraud detection Services to our customers. 

Riskified uses cookies and web beacons and other similar technologies in connection with our Platform and Service. Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when users visit certain web pages. Most Internet browsers automatically accept cookies. A user can instruct his or her browser, by editing its options, to stop accepting cookies or prompt the user before accepting a cookie from the websites the user visits. If the user does not accept cookies, however, he may not be able to enjoy the full functionality of many of the websites he visits. 

Riskified also uses web beacons, in combination with cookies, to analyze usage patterns. The use of a web beacon allows us to record that someone has visited a particular web page, along with additional Non-PII that the website may choose to include with the beacon. Therefore, even if a user disables the browser from accepting cookies we may be able to collect information on such user.

HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT? 

The information that we collect is used in order to analyze and provide our customers with an evaluation of whether a user may be engaging in fraudulent behavior or whether there is a risk that a transaction is fraudulent or unauthorized. Except for the information collected from our customer we may use information from different sources, including other customers or third party providers.

Riskified does not sell, distribute or disclose personally identifiable information or information on individual users or customers. 

Riskified may disclose information if it reasonably believe that it is legally required to do so or in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person. Riskified may share aggregated data derived from the Platform, including, for example, statistics about Platform activity.  Finally, Riskified may transfer information to a successor entity in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, sale of assets, reorganization, or other corporate change.
