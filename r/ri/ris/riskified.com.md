# Privacy Policy | Riskified

We, atRiskified Ltd. ("Riskified" "we", "our" or "us") provide online merchants(a “Merchant”) a service that helps them prevent fraudulent online transactions ( the "Fraud Prevention"). Such Merchants may be very much the one you are now placing an order on. 

Merchants integrate our Fraud Prevention on their eCommerce websites and mobile apps where consumers like you place orders (“eCommerce Platform”). This enables us to collect personal data from you. 

This Privacy Policy ( the “Policy”) explains our privacypractices for our Fraud Prevention. It describes how we collect personal information, use it and share it and the rights and options available to you with respect to your information. 

Please note that this Policy does not cover the practices or policies of Merchants, the eCommerce Platforms, or of other parties. 

You are not obligated by law to provide us with your personal data, but the eCommerce Platform may require that you provide us your personal data in order for it to be able to consider or process the order you place. 

## In short…

The following key points of the Privacy Policy are only brought for your convenience. They do not substitute the full Policy. 

  * We collect various data regarding your transaction, device data, geolocation data, analytical data and cross-referenced data. 
  * You information is processed pursuant to your consent or the legitimate interests of the Merchant.
  * We use the information first and foremost to analyze whether the transaction is fraudulent.
  * We share your information mainly to operate the Fraud Prevention. For that purpose, we may share elements of the personal data we collect with third parties and operators of online publicly available data sources for cross-referencing purposes. 
  * The Merchant may use Riskified’s fraud assessment to decide whether to accept or decline your order based solely on automated processing. 
  * You may request to access your personal information, or have us update, correct or delete such information, if the law provides you those rights. 
  * We may store and process information outside the country where you are located.
  * We retain the personal data we collect only for as long as needed in order to comply with our obligations under this Policy.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Transaction Data.** When you place an order with the eCommerce Platform, we collect various data regarding your transaction such as your name, email, the items you purchased, price paid, shipping information and basic information from your account on the eCommerce Platform (if you are registered with an account there ). We also collect basic information about your payment and billing method, but we do not collect or keep your complete credit card number. 

**Device data.** We collect information about the personal computer or mobile device youuse to access the eCommerce Platform, including its model, its operating system, unique device identifiers, browser type, mobile network information and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you accessed the eCommerce Platform. 

**Geo-location data .** If you use the eCommerce Platform’s mobile app we also collect your precise geo-location when you actively use the app. If you use the eCommerce Platform’s website, we will collect your town-approximate geo-location. 

**Analytical data .** We collect analytical data about your use of the eCommerce Platform. For example, we collect the frequency of your access tothe eCommerce Platform, the pages and items on the eCommerce Platform that you viewed or interacted with. 

**Cross-references.** We also cross-reference, verify and enhance the accuracy of the data outlined above, using publicly available third party sources such as online search engines, online ‘white pages’ and online mapping services. 

**Inquiries.** If you contact us for questions or complaints, we will collect the information related to your inquiry. This may include your name, email address, postal address, telephone number and other contact information, depending on the nature of your inquiry. 

## USE OF COLLECTED INFORMATION

We, as the data controller, process your personal data pursuant to your consent or the legitimate interests of the Merchant. You may withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of data processing we carried out based on your consent before such withdrawal. 

We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

  * When you place an order on an eCommerce Platform we crunch the aggregate data of your activities across the eCommerce Platforms of all Merchants we operate. We use this data to provide the eCommerce Platform a fraud analysis indicating whether or not the order is, in our assessment, a fraudulent online transaction. It is then up to the eCommerce Platform, not us, to determine in its own discretion, whether to accept and process your order, or decline it. 
  * Improving and enhancing Fraud Prevention and developing new services.
  * Statistical analysis of consumers' activities.
  * Handling complaints.
  * Enforcing this Policy and preventing misuse of the Fraud Prevention.
  * Taking any action in any case of dispute involving you, with respect or in relation to Fraud Prevention. 
  * As otherwise may be mandated by law or to protect our legal rights and property and those of third parties. 



## SHARING INFORMATION COLLECTED

We may share the information outlined in this Policy with others, in the following instances:

  * With our contractors and service providers, in order to help us to provide Fraud Prevention. For example, we process the data using cloud service providers. 
  * We may share limited elements of the personal data we collect with a number of third parties and operators of online publicly available data sources (such as online search engines, online ‘white pages’, online mapping services etc.). We do this in order to cross-reference, verify and enhance the accuracyofthe data we collect. 
    * Those data sources may use the data we share with them for their own purposes, in accordance with their own policies. 
    * Several of these data sources are companies operating in countries outside your local territory or the European Economic Area, in legal environments that may not be adequate by EU data protection standards. You may opt-outofhaving your personal data shared with those data sources. To exercise this right please contact [support@riskified.com](mailto:support@riskified.com)
  * In seldom occasions, we may share limited elements of your personal data with the Merchant with whom the transaction was made, for review or audit purposes.

  * If the operation of the Fraud Prevention is organized within a different framework, or through another legal structure or entity (such as due to a merger or acquisition). 
  * We may share personally identifiable information with our corporate group entities, but their use of such information must comply with the Policy. 



## AUTOMATED DECISION MAKING

The eCommerce Platform may, in its own discretion, use Riskified’s fraud score assessment to make a decision on whether to accept or decline your order, based solely on automated processing. Please direct inquiries concerning the decision about your order to the eCommerce Platform.

## ACCESSING, UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND OBTAINING A COPY OF IT

If the law grants you such rights, you may ask to access the personal information about you that is stored in our systems. You may also ask for our confirmation as to whether or not we process personal data concerning you.

Subject to the limitations in law, you may request that we update, correct or delete inaccurate or outdated information, and have us suspend the use of personal data whose accuracy you contest while we verify the status of that data.

## TRANSFER OF DATA OUTSIDE YOUR TERRITORY

We frequently process the information under arrangements aimed at providing an adequate level of data protection, which include EU decisions recognizing the adequacy of those countries and model contract clauses.

You agree to the transfer of your information to such other countries for the purpose of processing as described in this Policy, including through cloud services.

## Latest Platform and Services Privacy Policy Amendments

Please read the full version of the Privacy Policy to familiarize yourself with how Riskified uses your data in order to provide its Services. 

  * We detailed which data points we collect to provide our Service, whether or not we share such data and with whom, what we use the data for, and how. 
  * We also provided you with a more detailed explanation as to your rights in connection with the data we collect, and how you can contact us to make any required correction, thereby allotting you greater control over your own personal information. 



## INFORMATION SECURITY
