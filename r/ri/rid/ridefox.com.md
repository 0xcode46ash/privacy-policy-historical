FOX collects information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners. 

FOX automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, FOX cookie information, and the pages of information you request. 

FOX uses information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

FOX provides the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with FOX under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help FOX communicate with you about offers from FOX and its marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

FOX responds to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims;

FOX believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of FOX's Terms Of Use, or as otherwise required by law. 

FOX transfers information about you if FOX is acquired by, acquires or is merged with another company. In this event, FOX will notify you before information about you becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

FOX may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. In such event advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria - for example, men ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area. By interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad. 

FOX advertisers may include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies). 

FOX works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business.

FOX may use web beacons to access FOX cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with FOX products and services.

FOX limits access to your personal information to employees who FOX reasonably believes need access to that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. 

FOX has physical and procedural safeguards to protect personal information about you.

FOX may update this policy. FOX will notify you about significant changes in the way personal information is treated by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your FOX account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
