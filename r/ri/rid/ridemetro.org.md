Please note that, with certain exceptions, the majority of information collected or maintained by METRO may be subject to the provisions of the Texas Public Information Act (Chapter 552, Texas Government Code) for disclosure to the public upon request. If you send METRO an electronic mail message with a question or comment that contains personally identifying information, or fill out a form and electronically send it to METRO, this information may be subject to disclosure. This information will not be disclosed to a third party unless required by law, court order, or as legally required to do so in connection with law enforcement investigations or other legal proceedings.

We will not sell or release your e-mail address unless you affirmatively consent to its release.

Please note that using the METRO's web site or any other communications with METRO online shall constitute affirmative consent to release your e-mail address.
