# Privacy Policy

Privacy/ Security/ Fraud Prevention

**Thank you for shopping at Rimmer Bros.**  
We appreciate your business and are committed to your privacy. Your personal information and customer records are held securely on our system and are never disclosed to any outside 3rd parties at any time. As a customer, and additionally when you subscribe to our email list, the information you provide is used to send you details of new products, special offers, news, etc. You can request to unsubscribe at any time.

Our website uses industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, to provide encryption of personal information such as your name, address and credit card details. In this way, information passed between your computer and our website cannot be read in the unlikely event of someone intercepting it. All credit and debit card transactions are secure. We will only accept orders using Secure Socket Layer technology-this means you cannot inadvertently reveal personal information by using an unsecured connection. In order for SSL security to work, you must use an SSL enabled browser.

Please note that email encryption is not always secure, so please use our website for placing your order. If you still have reservations, you can call to place your order on +44(0)1522 568000 or FAX it on +44(0)1522 567600. 

We do not show your credit card details on any paperwork. To prevent fraudulent or unauthorised use of credit cards for first-time buyers, we insist that your first order is delivered directly to the card holder's registered address. Additionally, we randomly select orders for authorisation checks prior to processing.
