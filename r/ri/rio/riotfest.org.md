This Privacy Policy governs the manner in which Riot Fest Corporation (“Riot Fest”) collects, uses, maintains and discloses information collected from users (each, a “User” or “you”) of the http://www.riotfest.org website (“Site”). This privacy policy applies to the Site and all products and services offered by Riot Fest (collectively, the “Services”).This policy also applies to data Riot Fest may collect across unaffiliated sites to help us better understand our Users and improve the Services.

Riot Fest is committed to protecting the privacy of its Users and this Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and what we do to protect it so that you can make informed decisions when interacting with the Site or using the Services.

Information We Collect

We may collect two categories of information from you, Personal Information and Non-Personal Information, each of which is described below.

Personal identification information

We may collect Personal Information from Users. “Personal Information” includes information that can be used to personally identify you, such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number and credit card information, username and password. We may collect Personal Information in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our Site, register on the Site, place an order on the Site or otherwise with Riot Fest, subscribe to the newsletter, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources we make available on our Site or through the Services. Users may be asked for, as appropriate, name, email address, mailing address, phone number, and credit card information. Users may, however, visit our Site anonymously. We will collect personal identification information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Personal Information that we collect depends on how you use the Site and Services. For example, by registering for an account, we may collect certain information to enable the account setup, such as username, name, email address and other clearly stated items during the account setup process. If you place an order through our Site we may collect additional information like shipping and billing address and financial information like credit card number, expiration date, security code and other billing information to permit us to process payments for items you purchase through the Site. Providing your Personal Information to us is your choice. If you choose not to provide us with certain Personal Information, you may not be able to take advantage of certain features of the Site or Services, may not be able to create an account, and may not be able to make purchases from the Site.

If you purchase tickets to an event through our Site using the Services, your payment will be processed through Ticketfly.com and Eventbrite.com.
