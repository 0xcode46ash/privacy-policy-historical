We use cookies ("web analytic" cookies) to help us track usage patterns in order to improve and manage our site. We do not use them to serve adverts or other promotional materials. We also log your domain and IP address automatically when you visit our site, however this information does not identify you as an individual, but only the computer that you are using to view the site and your approximate geographic location. 

This website contains links to other Rio Tinto business and third-party websites. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the privacy statements of those websites. Rio Tinto takes no responsibility for the privacy practices or the content of any websites other than this one.

We store this information very carefully, and it will not be passed to anyone outside the Rio Tinto Group for any other purpose, except with those selected third party organisations who may be asked to assist us in providing you with the information, goods, products or services that you have requested. However, where it is necessary, in order to answer your enquiry, the information you have provided may be passed to any Rio Tinto office worldwide. By sending this information to us you are consenting to the personal information contained therein being transferred within the Rio Tinto Group worldwide and being processed by the Rio Tinto Group for these purposes.

As we plan to keep our privacy statement current, this information can be subject to change. When appropriate, a revised privacy statement will be posted on our website which will incorporate any changes. We recommend you return periodically to review the latest policy.
