## Our Policy

Welcome to the web site (the "Site") of Electronic Commodities Exchange, L.P. (d/b/a Ritani) ( **"Ritani"** , "we", "us" and/or "our"). This Site is operated by Ritani and has been created to enable purchases of diamonds, bridal and other fine jewelry and to provide information about our organization (the **"Ritani Services"** ) to our Site visitors ("you", "your"). This Privacy Policy sets forth Ritani's policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (including, by way of example, name, address, preferences, credit card number, Wish List items, favorite local jeweler, billing and shipping addresses) ( **"Personal Data"** ) and other information that is collected from Site visitors.

## Information we collect

When you interact with us through the Site, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you, as further described below:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Ritani Services or use certain Ritani Services. Wherever Ritani collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.

**By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data to this Site, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of Ritani and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United States.**

**Other Information:**

**Non-Identifiable Data:** When you interact with Ritani through the Site, we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Ritani may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by Ritani affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. 

Our third-party advertising service providers may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information collected and used by these companies, please visit [DAA opt-out program](http://www.aboutads.info/choices) or [NAI opt-out program](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices).

In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web browsers, you will find a "help" section on the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because they allow you to take advantage of some of the Site's features. 

**Aggregated Personal Data:** : In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Ritani Services, Ritani often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Data and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Ritani may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Ritani may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

## Our Use of Your Personal Data and Other Information

If you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access to the Ritani Services, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services (including, by way of example, to complete particular transactions, to provide personalized services and to place you on mailing lists for newsletters). Ritani and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the "Ritani Related Companies") may also use your Personal Data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand our users and to improve the Ritani Services. Ritani and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

If Ritani intends on using any Personal Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy, you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time at which the Personal Data is collected.

## Our Disclosure of Your Personal Data and Other Information

Ritani is not in the business of selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

**Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.

**Retail Affiliates:** We will share your Personal Data with our retail jeweler affiliates which you select in order for you to engage in an in-store retail experience with such retail jeweler affiliate.

**Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:** Ritani, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases, managing customer reviews and moderation and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
