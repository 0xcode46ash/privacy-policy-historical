# Rite Aid - Privacy Statement

**Privacy**

At Rite Aid Corporation we are committed to providing you with the most advanced pharmacy care possible. The personal and medical information we receive from you on the Internet or in our stores is vital for us to help you maintain your health. We use this information to create a health profile for you in Life CheckSM pharmacy system.

Our Life CheckSM system notifies our pharmacist of potentially harmful drug interactions with other prescriptions or over the counter medications you may be taking, as they are submitted to the system.

You have the right not to disclose your medical history to us. If you choose to provide us with your medical information, Rite Aid holds all that information in the strictest privacy. We encourage you to complete the information so that we can give you the most comprehensive pharmacy care possible. Also see drugstore.com's [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/redir/?go=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5kcnVnc3RvcmUuY29tL3ByaXZhY3kuYXNwP2FpZD05MjI1&from=aHR0cDovL3d3dy5yaXRlYWlkLmNvbS9ob21lL3ByaXZhY3kucGhw) as it pertains to refilling your prescription drug order through the Internet. Although our website contains links to other sites, we do not share any of your information with these sites. We do not make any endorsement of or representation or warranty regarding linked sites or their content since they are not controlled by Rite Aid. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or security procedures of these links.

With each prescription you submit on the Internet to our partner, drugstore.com, they ask you if you want to receive e-mail at the time your prescription is due for a refill. So as not to reveal any information about your medical condition, the e-mail will not refer to the drug by name, only by prescription number. 

We may occasionally send useful information to you by e-mail, including new products and when specials or promotions become available. Your name and address are used only for Rite Aid offers and promotions; we do not release your name to any other parties. You may decline to receive any additional e-mails concerning new products and services by calling 1-800 RITE AID and we will promptly remove your name from the mailing list.
