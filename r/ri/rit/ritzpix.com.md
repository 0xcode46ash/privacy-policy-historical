We at RitzPix are firmly committed to safeguarding your privacy and making sure you know how we gather and use your private information. We hope you’ll take the time to read the following, but rest assured that if it’s too long for you, or if you have any questions or concerns, please email us at customerserv@ritzpix.com and we will try our best to answer them. One more thing: throughout this statement, "we" or "us" means RitzPix, while “you” means you, the Customer. Deep, eh?

**Your photos, generally**  
The most important thing you should take away from this statement is that your photos are safe with us and no one else can see them unless you choose to share them. Now, if you do decide share your photos with other people (by clicking "Share" on the photo or album), RitzPix will send a message to your invitees with a link to your album. That link _could_ be forwarded by those people (you do know) to other people (who you may not know). So be judicious about whom you are sharing your photos with.

**Your Personal Information**  
RitzPix only uses your personal information to manage and print your photos. Let’s be clear here: We will not rent, share or sell your personal information. That said, like every rule, there are a few limited exceptions. For example, if you give us your express permission to do so, if the law requires it, or if we need to protect the rights or property of RitzPix or others, then we may have to share your pictures. But these are exceedingly rare cases (none has ever occurred in our history) and we will try to keep it that way.  
We protect you another way too. While we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time (with or without notice), we will NOT make any changes that diminishes these protections unless you give us permission.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
 _Information You Explicitly Provide_  
In order to create your account or place any print orders, you’re going to have to give us certain pieces of personal information to us, such as your name, mailing and email address, phone number, and a credit card number and expiration date. We’ll use that information to process and communicate with you concerning your order. We may also ask you for similar information if you request a newsletter, enter a contest, fill out a customer survey or participate in a program.

This type of information is valuable to us so we can improve RitzPix and customize your experience. For that reason, we occasionally share this information with our hosting companies, engineers, consultants as needed, all to improve the service and market products to you. But remember that all of these folks are also required to keep your information confidential, just like we are.

We also use aggregate non-personal information (i.e. information that does not include personally identifiable data) for statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, content improvement and marketing, promotional and advertising purposes. We may also make that aggregate non-personal information available to select third party partners, but there is no way for these third parties to know who you are individually.

**Information We Automatically Collect**  
 _Cookies and Invisible Gifs (also known as "Clear Gifs," "Web Bugs" and "Tracker Gifs")_  
Generally speaking, we use cookies and invisible gifs to track users of the Service (including our newsletter service) and RitzPix's Web site, including photo albums and the shopping areas. For example, when you visit our site, we assign you a unique User ID and store it on your computer in the form of a cookie (unless your browser's cookie support has been disabled). Through the use of cookies, User IDs, and invisible gifs, we are able to optimize the performance and functionality of our site, and to personalize our site for you and present you with content and offers specific to your interests.

_Disabling Cookies_  
If you don’t like the idea of your information being stored in cookies, we suggest you disable cookie support in your browser, though this will limit RitzPix's performance and functionality. Your browser documentation will tell you how to disable cookie support.

_IP Address_  
We analyze IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to your computer's User ID, with the following exception: when you place an order using our online checkout process we record your computer's IP address with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent.

_Affiliate Site ID_  
If you entered RitzPix's Web site by clicking a link or promotion on another Web site (including another co-branded partner Web site), or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for our site, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. We may also use this information in conjunction with your activities on our site to help us identify what offers and services may be of interest to you.

_Third Party Service Providers_  
We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist us in providing the Service to you. Following are some examples of our use of third party service providers: We may share your credit card information with a financial institution to effect your purchase of our products using your credit card. We may share personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) with third parties that assist us with the administration of our newsletters or contests or that help us understand what our customers want and need from our service, including analysis of the results of particular surveys we may perform. We also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to our Web site, including visitors that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party Web sites and those visitors' activities on the site. We may also choose to offer certain third party products, such as Custom Printed Cards or PrePaid Cards through the Service and may disclose certain portions of your personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) to allow those product producers to fulfill your product order.

_Your Copyrights_  
RitzPix respects others’ intellectual property rights. We claim no ownership rights in any image contained in any of your photos and will not share your images unless you tell us to or if we believe we are legally required to. Please note that when you share a photo album, you allow the recipients of that album to share and make photographic prints from the images contained in that album.

_Choice/Opt-Out_  
We give you the right to opt-out of receiving our newsletters and other promotional communications. Your Account settings allow you to stop getting these communications. RitzPix will continue to send you non-promotional, service emails concerning your account and the management or notifications of orders, confirmation of orders, or expiration of albums or images within your account. You can also review or change any information you previously provided to us, please go to the “Account" section of the site. However, if you want to de-activate your RitzPix account, you must email us, noting that any service will be billed/refunded as agreed when you signed up. Your account will be de-activated and you will no longer receive communications from us; however, we will keep your account information in our database for record-keeping purposes only.

_Security_  
We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information that we control. We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, access to that data is limited to authorized RitzPix staff members and our hosting company only and is further restricted by password protection mechanisms. By default, all orders placed on our site are done on a secure server that encrypts all financial information through SSL. We will not store your credit card information in our database unless you explicitly instruct us to do so.

_Other Sites; Contact Information_  
 _Links to Other Sites_  
Remember that when we provide you links to other sites, we cannot be responsible for their privacy practices or the content.

_Contact information on privacy_  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of the Service, or your dealings with us, you can email your questions to customerserv@ritzpix.com
