### Privacy Statement for Online Imaging Services for RitzPix Users.

**

 **Last Revised September 6, 2006**

**We at RitzPix have a firm commitment to safeguarding the privacy of our customers. This page will inform you about our information gathering and dissemination practices for RitzPix and all of our services, including our online imaging services at RitzPix.com (the "Service").** If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should contact ritzpix@ritzcamera.com.

RitzPix is also referred to in this Statement as "we" and "us". 

**In General**  
**Your Photo Albums, Album Sharing, and Address Book**  
RitzPix is committed to providing you with a safe environment to upload, share and print your photos. Except for albums you choose to share publicly without password protection, your photos are password protected and are not visible to others unless you explicitly share them. See **["Terms and Conditions"](http://www.ritzpix.com/help/terms-and-conditions)**. for further details.

If you invite visitors to see your photos, by clicking on the "Share" tab, RitzPix will send an email to your list of invitees containing the URL to your album. **Please note that your invitees can then forward the email containing the URL to other parties if they choose to do so when they share albums publicly.**

**Your Personal Information**   
RitzPix only uses your personal information to conduct business with you. Your personally identifiable information will not be rented, sold or shared with any third party, except as described in this Privacy Statement or as otherwise agreed by you. RitzPix may disclose information it has collected from any member of the Service and/or content any member has made available on the Service when it believes in good faith that the law or legal process requires it, or when it is necessary to do so to protect the rights or property of RitzPix or others. 

**We may change this Privacy Policy without notice from time to time. Please visit this page for updates and changes. Regardless of later changes or updates, RitzPix will not use your information in a new way without first providing you with an opportunity to opt-out.**

**Also, if you have not already done so, please click here to review the **["Terms and Conditions"](http://www.ritzpix.com/help/terms-and-conditions)** that govern your use of the Service. Our privacy policy is considered part of the Terms of Service. **

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

  


**Information You Explicitly Provide**

In order to establish your account or to place any orders for prints or other products provided through the Service, you will be asked to provide certain personally identifiable information to us, such as your name, mailing and email address, phone number, and a credit card number and expiration date. We will use that information to process and communicate with you concerning any order you may submit, and to enable online imaging services to you. At times, we may also ask you for similar information, and information about your photography equipment and practices, if you choose to request a newsletter, enter a contest, fill out a customer survey or participate in a program. We may use this information to make improvements to our service or customize your service experience. In addition, we will share this information with our hosting Company (Lucidiom, Inc. based out of Viena, VA), who is bound contractually to adhere to the same confidentiality terms as you have and may only use your information in accordance with our privacy statement herein. In any event, we will not share your personally identifiable information with anyone, including other third parties without giving you the opportunity to opt-out, except as expressly described in the "Third Party Service Providers" section of this Privacy Statement. 

We use aggregate non-personal information (i.e. information that does not include personally identifiable data) for statistical analysis of user behavior, product development, content improvement and marketing, promotional and advertising purposes. We may also make that aggregate non-personal information available to select third party partners. 

**Information We Automatically Collect**

_Cookies and Invisible Gifs (also known as "Clear Gifs," "Web Bugs" and "Tracker Gifs")_  
Generally speaking, we use cookies and invisible gifs to track users of the Service (including our newsletter service) and RitzPix's Web site, including photo albums and the shopping areas. For example, when you visit our site, we assign you a unique User ID and store it on your computer in the form of a cookie (unless your browser's cookie support has been disabled). Through the use of cookies, User IDs, and invisible gifs, we are able to optimize the performance and functionality of our site, and to personalize our site for you and present you with content and offers specific to your interests. 

_Disabling Cookies_  
If you are uncomfortable with the idea of your information being stored in cookies, we recommend disabling cookie support in your browser, though please understand this will limit the performance and functionality of RitzPix's Web site. Your browser documentation will provide specific procedures for disabling cookie support. If you would like to opt-out from the newsletter mailing list, please see the instructions under the Choice/Opt-Out section below. 

**IP Address**  
We analyze IP addresses in the aggregate for system administration purposes and to gather broad demographic information. We do not link IP addresses to your computer's User ID, with the following exception: when you place an order using our online checkout process we record your computer's IP address with your order to help us identify fraudulent credit card use. We may share this information with the financial institution that issued the credit card with which an order was placed, or with law enforcement authorities if we determine, or are notified, that the use of the credit card was fraudulent. 

**Affiliate Site ID**  
If you entered RitzPix's Web site by clicking a link or promotion on another Web site (including another co-branded partner Web site), or if you used a site that provides universal registration services to sign up for our site, we will store the ID of that affiliate site in our database along with your computer's User ID. We do this to ensure that the affiliate site receives proper credit for any subsequent order you might place. We may also use this information in conjunction with your activities on our site to help us identify what offers and services may be of interest to you. 

**Third Party Service Providers**  
We may share your personally identifiable information with those companies that assist us in providing the Service to you. Following are some examples of our use of third party service providers: We may share your credit card information with a financial institution to effect your purchase of our products using your credit card. We may share personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) with third parties that assist us with the administration of our newsletters or contests or that help us understand what our customers want and need from our service, including analysis of the results of particular surveys we may perform. We also engage third parties to assist us by tracking the number of visitors to our Web site, including visitors that have "clicked-through" from specified promotions on third party Web sites and those visitors' activities on the site. We may also choose to offer certain third party products, such as Custom Printed Cards or PrePaid Cards through the Service and may disclose certain portions of your personally identifiable information (not including credit card information) to allow those product producers to fulfill your product order. 

**Your Copyrights**  
RitzPix Imaging Network respects the intellectual property rights of others. We claim no ownership rights in any image contained in any of your photo albums and will not share your images unless instructed by you or otherwise required by law. Please note that when you share a photo album, you allow the recipients of that album to share and make photographic prints from the images contained in that album. For more information, see our **["Terms and Conditions"](http://www.ritzpix.com/help/terms-and-conditions)**. 

**Opting-Out, Updates and Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Statement, access to that data is limited to authorized RitzPix staff members and our hosting company only and is further restricted by password protection mechanisms. By default, all orders placed on our site are done on a secure server that encrypts all financial information through SSL.
