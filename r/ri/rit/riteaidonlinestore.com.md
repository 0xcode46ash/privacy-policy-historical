These functions may include sending postal mail and e-mails, delivering packages, fulfilling orders, analyzing information or processing payments. Our agents may not use personal information for any purpose other than in performing their functions for the Company. We also may be required by valid legal process (warrants or subpoenas), to prevent harm or injury (such as product recalls or other circumstances) or by law to disclose your medical and personal information.

You may decline to receive any additional e-mails concerning new products and services by [emailing](mailto:inquiry@riteaid.com "emailing") us or calling 1-800 RITE AID (1-800-748-3243) and we will promptly remove your name from the mailing list.

### Security

Riteaid.com utilizes Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts your personal and medical information as it is transmitted over the Internet. Rite Aid is committed to securing your personal information, and this technology is designed for use with secure Web servers.

When you visit Riteaid.com, you will be assigned a "cookie", which is a small text file stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies store your preferences and settings for a particular website and use them the next time you visit.

### Children's Privacy

Just like you, we're especially aware of children's privacy issues. We know that parents are justifiably concerned about their children's activities online and what's being done with the information they reveal. That's why we will never intentionally collect information from children under 13, with the exception of e-mail addresses used only for reply purposes. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe that we might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact us at 1-800 RITE AID (1-800-748-3243).
