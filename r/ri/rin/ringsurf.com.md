# RingSurf: Privacy

No personal information is collected by RingSurf from visitors to the our website, when viewing pages, or when navigating a Net Ring provided by our service. We also do not collect or harvest the EMail addresses of people who EMail us directly. We only use them to respond to your queries. 

When creating a Net Ring, or joining an existing Net Ring, you are asking to become a member of the RingSurf website, and will be required to provide a Name a valid EMail address, and the Year you were born. The Name is required but may be an alias, nickname, or pseudonym. The EMail Address is required and without a proper, functional email address provided, you may have trouble accessing and using some member features. We require the Year you were born because we do not allow anyone under the age of 14 to become a member. 

When joining a Net Ring hosted on RingSurf, the personal information provided will be made available to the Ringmaster for the Ring you joined for the sole purpose of managing their ring and emailing ring members with Ring related information only. Ringmasters are members like yourself, and are independent of RingSurf itself, and as such we have no direct control over what a Ringmaster may ultimately do with your information. If you find a Ringmaster abusing such information please [let us know](https://web.archive.org/email.html). 

Except as provided for above, Any personal information collected will not be disclosed to any third party, except in the case of cooperating with law enforcement agencies to aid in identifying those persons using our services for illegal activities. Information may be given even without a subpoena or court order if we believe such illegal activity is being conducted through our services.
