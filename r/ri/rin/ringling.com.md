**1\. What sort of information does Ringling.com collect about its users, and how is this information collected and used?**  
At various places on our Web site, we present games, activities and e-mail interfaces that require you to reveal varying levels of personal information. Whenever we ask you to reveal any kind of personal information, we explain precisely what we will be doing with that information. Most importantly: We will never provide that information to a third party unless you provide us with specific permission to do so. A list of Web site activities and specifics about the information we collect follows:

 **E-Specials and Discounts:** When you sign up to receive [**e-specials and discounts**](https://web.archive.org/PortalContent.aspx?linkID=348), we will ask you for your name, address, e-mail address, number of children in your household, and the last time you attended a Feld Entertainment event. This information is used strictly to provide you with early notice and special offers to Feld productions that will be coming to your hometown. If you wish to unsubscribe from any eBUZZ list to which you’ve been added, you simply need to send a blank e-mail to the address provided at the bottom of the eBUZZ e-mail you received.

This information is used strictly to fulfill certificate requests, and send information about Feld Entertainment events to the household. Your personal information is never passed along to any third party for any reason whatsoever.

 **Contact Us:** When you send us a comment or question via e-mail, we ask you for your e-mail address, first name and the city and state where you attended the show.

We will never pass along the information you provide to Ringling.com and Feld Entertainment to any third party for any reason, unless you provide us with explicit permission to do so.

If you give us permission to share your personal information with third parties, we may share this information with companies that would like to send you special offers or other promotional materials about goods and services they offer. We call this 'sharing for promotional purposes.' Our goal is to limit sharing for promotional purposes to companies that will offer our customers high quality products and services.
