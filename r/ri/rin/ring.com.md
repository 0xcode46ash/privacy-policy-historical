### YOUR RING™ VIDEO DOORBELL AND OTHER RING PRODUCTS

Information input during setup: When you install your device, you may be asked for certain basic information like your device name, description, ZIP or postal code, as well as where in your home you’re installing your device. This information is used to personalize your experience – for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification. 

Environmental data from Ring™ Products’ sensors: We collect data from sensors built into some of our devices or products installed on your property. These sensors collect data such as device temperature and ambient light. By recording this information, your device can know, for instance, whether it’s dark and it should turn on night vision.

Video and audio signals and data: After you begin using your device, we may process information from your device so that we can send you alerts when your doorbell is pressed or when your device detects motion. This information processing may include capturing and e-mailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification, or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. When you access our Cloud Service (as defined in the Terms of Service) on a trial basis or a subscription basis, we will record and process video and/or audio recordings from your device. In addition, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data recordings from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period, and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time. Additionally, regardless of your use of our Cloud Service, we will capture, process and retain Ring Neighborhood Recordings (as defined in the Terms of Service) to enable you to participate in the Ring Neighborhood feature, and may share certain Ring Neighborhood Recordings that you elect to post to the Services to other users as further described in the Terms of Service.

Technical information from the device: In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with your device, we may record your device serial number, software version, and/or technical information such as Wi-Fi signal strength.

Saved and Shared Content: You may save and may choose to share certain content like video clips, images, captions, and comments for other people to access using the Services. We will collect and store information that will allow us to save or share your content as directed by you through the Services.

Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of our products installed on your property. You are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use our Services or products. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using the Ring® Video Doorbell or Stick Up Cam. Note in particular that recording and sharing clips that involve other people may affect their privacy and/or data protection rights.

### ORDERS

When you place an order for a product or service, we will collect your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal information is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status. Also, once you place an order or make an inquiry regarding our products or Services, we may send you informational e-mails about our products and Services, including promotional offers.
