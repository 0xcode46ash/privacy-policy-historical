This Privacy Policy is intended to help you understand how Bot Home Automation, Inc., its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Bot Home Automation," "we," "us" or "our") collect, use and safeguard the information you provide to us on this website or through our Services (as defined in our “Terms of Use”). By using or accessing our Services, you signify your acknowledgment and assent to the Privacy Policy set forth below. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Services.

### COLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you browse the Bot Home Automation website, you may generally do so anonymously without providing any personal information. However, there are cases in which we may ask you for personal data. For example, we will occasionally conduct on-line surveys to better understand the needs and profile of our visitors. In addition, we may request personal information when you register to receive additional information regarding our products and services, download software, sign up for a newsletter or send us a question. Even if you choose not to give information we request, you can still visit most of the Bot Home Automation website, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services. In case you change your mind or wish to update or delete your personal information (such as your ZIP code), we will endeavor to correct, update or remove the personal data you give us. You can update or delete your personal information by contacting us at the contact point specified below.

### YOUR RING™ VIDEO DOORBELL

_Information input during setup_ : When you install your device, you may be asked for certain basic information like your device name, description, ZIP or postal code, as well as where in your home you’re installing your device. This information is used to personalize your experience – for example, to tell you which device is triggering a notification.

_Environmental data from Ring™ Video Doorbells’ sensors_ : We collect data from sensors built into some of our devices or products installed on your property. These sensors collect data such as device temperature and ambient light. By recording this information, your device can know, for instance, whether it’s dark and it should turn on night vision.

_Video and audio signals and data_ : After you begin using your device, we may process information from your device so that we can send you alerts when your doorbell is pressed or when your device detects motion. This information processing may include capturing and e-mailing to you portions of this data as part of a notification, or analyzing the data to identify motion or other events. When you access our Cloud Service (as defined in “Terms of Use”) on a trial basis or a subscription basis, we will record and process video and/or audio recordings from your device (e.g., your Ring® Video Doorbell). In addition, we will capture, process and retain video and audio data recordings from your device for the duration of your recording subscription period, and you will be able to access those recordings using the Services during that time.

_Technical information from the device_ : In order to improve your experience over time and help troubleshoot any problem you may encounter with your device, we may record your device serial number, software version, and/or technical information such as Wi-Fi signal strength.

_Saved and Shared Content_ : You may save and may choose to share certain content like video clips, images, captions, and comments for other people to access using the Services. We will collect and store information that will allow us to save or share your content as directed by you through the Services.

Data protection and privacy laws in your country may impose certain responsibilities on you and your use of our products installed on your property. You are responsible for ensuring that you comply with any applicable laws when you use our devices or products. For example, you may need to display a notice that alerts visitors to your home that you are using the Ring® Video Doorbell. Note in particular that recording and sharing clips that involve other people may affect their privacy and/or data protection rights.

### ORDERS

When you place an order for a product or service, we will collect your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and expiration date. This personal information is required so that we can process and fulfill your order, send an order or shipping confirmation, as well as notify you of your order status. Also, once you place an order or make an inquiry regarding our products, we may send you informational e-mails about our products and services, including promotional offers. If you do not wish to receive such e-mails from us, you may unsubscribe at any time by e-mailing us at [help@ring.com](mailto:help@ring.com) or by clicking the unsubscribe link in the email.

### BOT HOME AUTOMATION MAILINGS/MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS

If you provide us with personal information, we may place you on our company’s e-mail list to receive e-mails regarding product/service updates, special offers, important issues and new products and services offered by Bot Home Automation and its affiliates. If you do not wish to receive e-mail updates or other marketing communications from our company or our affiliates, you may unsubscribe at any time by contacting us at [help@ring.com](mailto:help@ring.com)

If you do provide us with consent to share your information with other third party companies, we may share your information with third party companies who offer products and services that may be of interest to you. These companies may then contact you directly with product or sample offers, personalized offers and information, or to ask for your feedback on products and programs that they think may be of interest to you. While we use all reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your information, Bot Home Automation will have no liability for disclosure of any information obtained due to errors in transmission or the unauthorized acts of third parties.

We may share your personal information with our third party service providers at our discretion. We engage third party service providers to perform certain services on our behalf. In order to perform those services, the service providers may need to know your personal information. We require that they protect this information and only use it to perform services on our behalf. For example, we may use outside shipping companies, credit card processing companies, resellers, distributors, content providers, and/or other service providers.

We may share statistical or aggregated non-personal information about our users with advertisers, business partners, sponsors and other third parties. This data is used to customize Bot Home Automation website content and advertising to deliver a better experience to our users.
