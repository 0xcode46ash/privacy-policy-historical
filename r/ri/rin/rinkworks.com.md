# RinkWorks: Privacy Policy

* * *

* * *

_RinkWorks_ respects the privacy and confidentially of its associates and readers. Below is our policy regarding the privacy of Internet users.

  * _RinkWorks_ does not acquire or collect any personal information about you for any reasons other than internal use, except where explicitly indicated. Any and all personal information collected for internal use will be treated confidentially; it will not be given out, nor will it be used for any purpose other than the operation of the _RinkWorks_ site. (For example, some of our online features require registration to participate. If there is a technical problem, or a question we have concerning your use of the feature, we will use your email address, as submitted to us upon registration, to contact you about these matters. Your email address will not, however, be sold or given out to anyone.) _RinkWorks_ does, however, accrue anonymous information which is specific to its readers' browsing habits on _RinkWorks_. This information is anonymous; it does not contain personal details, although it does contain non-personally identifying details, including, but not limited to, your IP address and the browser you are using. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of tracking traffic flow patterns through the _RinkWorks_ site and measuring levels of interest and accessibility in different areas of _RinkWorks_.
  * An addendum to the above, _RinkWorks_ does, in some explicitly documented instances, collect voluntarily-supplied personal information, including, but not limited to, the [_Reader Survey_](https://web.archive.org/survey/) \-- which is used to collect information about what you like and don't like about _RinkWorks_ , is purely voluntary, and can be anonymous if you choose not to answer the questions about your name and email address -- and the [_Demographic Survey_](https://web.archive.org/demographic/), which is used to collect information about the types of visitors _RinkWorks_ receives, is also voluntary, and is always anonymous. In these and all other cases where _RinkWorks_ asks for personal information, it will be kept strictly confidential and used only for the express purposes for which it is asked.
  * The advertising banners used on most _RinkWorks_ pages may temporarily store some code within your browser that allows BURST!, our advertising agency, to respond properly to the ads that are delivered. These codes are commonly known as "cookies." The cookies served in conjunction with the ad banners is not the doing, nor the responsibility of _RinkWorks_. Here is a quotation of the relevant part of BURST!'s privacy policy:

> When you are first served a BURST! ad, BURST! may temporarily store some codes within your browser that allows us to respond properly to the ads that we deliver. These codes are commonly known as "cookies." For example, these codes let us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. It also helps us determine where to send you when you click on an ad. Unlike many other ad networks, we do not use cookies for the purpose of setting unique identifiers that are used to identify you whenever you return to a web site within the BURST! network. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 

  * This web site contains links to other sites. This privacy policy is for the sole use and purpose of _RinkWorks_ and does not cover the links _RinkWorks_ links to. Please be aware that _RinkWorks_ is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy practices of each and every web site that collects your personal information.
  * This site makes public forums available to you, including, but not limited to, the [_Message Forum_](https://web.archive.org/rinkforum/) and [_RinkChat_](https://web.archive.org/rinkchat/). Please be aware, whenever you post personal information online, through the _Message Forum_ , _RinkChat_ , or other public online area, that this information can be collected and used by others. _RinkWorks_ assumes any and all information posted to these public areas as intended for public disclosure.
  * _RinkWorks_ takes reasonable security measures to protect the loss, inappropriate disclosure, and misuse of the information under our control. However, should a breach in security occur and information stolen or altered by anyone, _RinkWorks_ cannot be held responsible for this loss or theft.
