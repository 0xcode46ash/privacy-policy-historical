The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"), which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used, and to provide some information on how cookies are used.

 **RMSession**  
Whilst RMSessionGUID announces you to each page, the RMSession cookie remembers important things about your session, for example, anything you've changed when configuring your PC.

 **PortalBasket**  
This cookie remembers information the contents of your shopping basket, if you're not logged in.

This cookie remembers which view you chose on the homepage ("I'm a School Leader", "I'm a Network Manager", etc.)

 **RootHomeControl**  
This cookie remembers which country you chose on the homepage - if you didn't choose a country it will default to the location of your Internet Service Provider.

 **_utm***  
This cookie is used by Google Analytics. Google Analytics collects and aggregates anonymous data on site visitors, it is not used to personally identify them, it's used to understand things like how many people visit the site over a given time period.

 **webabacus_id**  
This cookie is used by a similar data collection tool to Google Analytics, called Webabacus.
