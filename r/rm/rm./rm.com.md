**Cookies and IP addresses

The RM.com website uses cookies, which are small text files on your computer. A cookie contains identifying information.

This allows your shopping basket to be kept separate from other users and enables us to automatically complete some of the forms when you subsequently use them. The creation of a cookie on your computer does not give the website any access to other information such as your email address. 

The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"), which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used, and to provide some information on how cookies are used.

We use cookies on RM.com to improve your experience on the site, mainly so that we don't have to ask you for your information on every page you visit.

We understand that when searching for employment a large amount of personal and highly confidential data is disclosed and we take our responsibility to protect this very seriously. This policy sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or you provide to us, will be processed by us.

**Information we may collect  
** We generally collect information contained in your CV such as name, address, home phone number, work phone number, mobile phone number(s), facsimile numbers, email addresses and general contact information to facilitate RM to be able to readily communicate with you. We also collect additional personal information such as your CV (your "information").  
We collect and may disclose statistical information gathered as a whole (e.g. total number of applicants and applicant origin) for internal reporting purposes. However, we never disclose information that identifies any individual for such purposes. We do not knowingly solicit information from children and we do not knowingly market our services to children.  
If you opt to provide Date of Birth, Sex, Marital Status or Nationality information, this information is gathered for diversity monitoring and reporting only and will not be used in the recruitment and selection process.

**How we may use this Information  
** RM gathers the personal information required for you to be considered for job vacancies within RM and to conduct research relating to our recruitment activities. Generally, the information gathered from you is used to assist you to search for RM job vacancies, apply for RM job vacancies and to be processed for each job application you submit. As such, it may require us to release your personal information with your consent to RM hiring managers, administrators and third party contractors.  
These RM hiring managers, administrators and third party contractors may be in the UK or in other parts of the world including outside the European Economic Area. By registering with RM, you agree that your information may be shared with RM hiring managers, administrators and third party contractors for the purpose of supporting you to find suitable RM job vacancies, applying for RM job vacancies, supporting our research relating to our recruitment activities and processing you for each job application you submit and you consent to the transfer of your information outside the European Economic Area.  
We may also use, disclose and communicate your personal information for compliance with any legal obligation to which we may be subject.  
RM uses all reasonable means to ensure that third party sources use your personal information only for the purposes for which it was provided and in adherence to the RM Privacy Policy. However, RM is not responsible for any improper use of your personal information that is beyond our reasonable control.  
We do not disclose your information to anyone except as described above, including personal information, CV information, email addresses, information about your visits our sites, etc.

**Third party links  
** Our careers site may, from time to time, contain links to other sites. If you follow a link to any of these websites, please note that these websites have their own privacy policies and that we do not accept any responsibility or liability for these policies. Please check these policies before you submit any personal data to these websites.

**Where we store your personal data  
** Your personal information is stored on a secure server hosted by an RM approved contractor. The server resides in the European Economic Area. RM is a global organisation, therefore, your data may be transferred to any of our operating businesses throughout the world with your consent, for the purpose of being considered for any RM job vacancy you apply for, or for being matched to specific RM job vacancies and being contacted by a RM hiring manager, administrator or third party contractor to discuss your interest and suitability.  
By submitting your personal information, you agree to RM transferring, storing and processing your personal information outside the European Economic Area.

**How is your personal information secured and protected?  
** We use commercially reasonable measures necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy.  
Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.  
Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.

**Access to information  
** The Data Protection Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request may be subject to a fee of £10 towards our costs in providing you with details of the information we hold about you.  
Changes to our privacy policy
