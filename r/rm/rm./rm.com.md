# Privacy Statement for www.rm.com

| Privacy Statement for www.rm.com  
---  
  
RM has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [www.rm.com](http://www.rm.com/)

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.

The [www.rm.com](http://www.rm.com/) website uses cookies, which are small text files on your computer. A cookie contains identifying information. The cookie is used to make the link between you and the information you have provided to the website. This allows your shopping basket to be kept separate from other users and enables us to automatically complete some of the forms when you subsequently use them. The creation of a cookie on your computer does not give the website any access to other information such as your email address. 

The European Union Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (the "Directive"), which came into force on 31st July 2002, recognises that cookies are a "legitimate and useful tool" for many activities, including verifying the identity of web site users. The Directive makes it compulsory for websites to inform users if cookies are being used, and to provide some information on how cookies are used. The [www.rm.com](http://www.rm.com/) website (in common with most other shopping websites) will not work without cookies. 

Our site's registration form requires you to provide us with some contact information (e.g. name and email address). We sometimes use this contact information from the registration form to send you information about our company and our products and services by phone, email, fax etc. This contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. If at any time you wish to stop receiving information from RM please contact us and we will update our records accordingly.

This site contains links to other sites. [www.rm.com](http://www.rm.com/) is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites.

In some cases, we work with other companies to provide products and services. In such cases we will never share your details directly with another company, except where this is required to fulfil an order for those third party products or services.

Our site uses a form to help us manage requests. We collect contact information (like email addresses). Contact information is used to respond to enquiries, or get in touch with you when necessary.

Our online surveys ask for contact information (like email addresses). We use contact information from our surveys to send information about our company.

We run competitions on our site in which we ask for contact information (like email addresses). We use contact information from competitions to send information about our company. Contact information is also used to contact you when necessary. Any other information is shared only within the RM Group of companies.  
   
Public Forums  
This site may include chat rooms, forums, message boards, and news groups. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.  
   
Security  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All instances of unauthorised attempted access to our site are logged and investigated. Where necessary RM will inform law enforcement agencies or other relevant organisations regarding misconduct.  
   
Email  
At RM we respect the privacy of email accounts and we store your email addresses just as securely as other information on [www.rm.com](http://www.rm.com/). Your details will not be passed to ANY organisation beyond the RM Group of companies without your explicit permission.

However, we may use email to keep you up to date with news about products, services and offers that we think maybe are of interest to you. If you do not want to be kept informed in this way by email, please let us know. You can do this by ticking the relevant box where your email address is stored when you register or by choosing the unsubscribe option within the email.
