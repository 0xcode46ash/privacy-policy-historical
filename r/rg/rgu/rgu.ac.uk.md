**Security**

Even the best policy cannot protect your online privacy and security in all circumstances. Your best protection is to understand the limits to privacy on the Internet and use common sense in all of your online activities. Be aware that email is an inherently insecure form of communication. Remember that in extreme cases third parties are sometimes able to intercept your unencrypted messages.

Robert Gordon University is concerned about the security of your personal information particularly when using our website. Although we have taken all reasonable security precautions, we cannot guarantee internet security and subsequently cannot guarantee that any information you input on our site is totally secure. In addition to our online security efforts, we have taken steps to protect your personal data offline as well. All of your information is restricted to our offices. Employees are granted access on a need-to-know basis and are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

**Your control over your personal information**

Opt-out / Changing your status: At any time you can withdraw permission for the use of your personal information. This can be done by contacting our data protection officer by sending a blank email to [k.fraser@rgu.ac.uk](mailto:k.fraser@rgu.ac.uk) and type "remove", in the subject field.
