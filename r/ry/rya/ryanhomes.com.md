Personal information is any information that can be used to identify you as an individual such as your name, email address, mailing address, buying needs, or other information required to provide a service you have requested.

Ryan Homes does not collect any information stored on your computer except for the information related to the browsing of Ryan Homes' websites. However, Ryan Homes does store information received from the Google Display Ad Network, which estimates a visitor's general age group, gender, and interests. This information remains strictly anonymous, and is stored solely for NVR's internal statistical purposes.

##### Uses of Your Personal Information

Understanding more about you so we can personalize newsletters and websites to your preferences. For example, allowing you the opportunity to request specific information on products and services that may be of interest to you.

  * Providing you personalized views of website content areas.
