|  Ryder Online Privacy Policy   
This policy is applicable to www.Ryder.com and other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by Ryder System, Inc., 3600 NW 82nd Avenue, Miami, Florida, 33166. 

For each visitor to our web page, our web server automatically recognizes only the visitor's domain name, but not the e-mail address. Therefore, we only collect visitors' domain names, and not the e-mail address of visitors to our web page -- unless that information is voluntarily submitted in one of the forms on the site. 

Information that is collected through forms on our website may be used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other marketing materials from us as a result of your activity on this website, please inform us via the contact information found on this page. 

If a visitor registers his/her name, address, e-mail address and/or additional contact information on the Ryder website to request marketing materials, that request is fulfilled by an outside company which only uses your information for these purposes. If you object to such use for any reason, you may stop this use either by e-mail request or in a letter. Additionally, if you would like marketing materials sent to you without going through the outside company, please inform us and they will be sent to you from Ryder headquarters. 

By using this site, you signify your assent to Ryder's Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
