Privacy Policy  


This policy is applicable to www.Ryder.com and other sites on the World Wide Web portion of the Internet owned and operated by Ryder System, Inc., 11690 NW 105 Street, Miami, FL 33178.

We use "cookies" on our website.  Cookies are pieces of information that an Internet site transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes.   The use of cookies is an industry standard -- you'll find them almost everywhere on the Internet.  Ryder uses cookies to recognize visitors and customers when they return to our sites. Once we know it's you, we can customize your online visit.

We can also show you new products and services based on your preferences or alert you to new website features. We may also evaluate our content and services and tailor our websites, for customers and visitors, based on other information we collect such as IP addresses, which are numbers assigned to your computer whenever you use the Internet, pixel tags (or clear gifs), and the type of Internet browser or operating system you are using. This information is collected in the aggregate, but we may tie it to your personal information through cookie use as described above.

Our company contracts under the confidentiality restrictions mentioned above with Coremetrics, a service partner, to provide data collection and reports regarding our customers' activities on our site. Coremetrics may use cookies on our behalf and may receive information about your browsing and buying activity.   Coremetrics may store member ID, city, state, zip code, and email address on our behalf.  Under no circumstances may Coremetrics use your information other than in connection with providing services to us to make our site more useful and efficient.  If you would like to opt out of these particular services, please click here.

If a visitor registers his/her name, address, e-mail address and/or additional contact information on the Ryder website to request marketing materials, that request is fulfilled by an outside company which only uses your information for these purposes.   If you object to such use for any reason, you may stop this use either by e-mail request or in a letter.   Additionally, if you would like marketing materials sent to you without going through the outside company, please inform us and they will be sent to you from Ryder headquarters.

By using this site, you signify your assent to Ryder's Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use this site. We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change modify, add, or remove portions of this policy at any time.   Please check this page periodically for changes.  Your continued use of this site following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
