**RYOT’S PRIVACY POLICY**

Welcome to RYOT! RYOT Corp (“ **RYOT** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”) operates this website (www.RYOT.org) (the “ **Site** ”) as well as a number of related services (collectively, the “ **Services** ”). The focus of our Site and Service is to provide readers with a destination to find out what’s going on in the world AND what can be done about it. Privacy is of great importance to us and we have established this privacy policy as a means to communicate our information collection, use and dissemination practices.

So we are clear on the terminology we use, “ **Personal Information** ” means contact information (e.g., your name, address, email address, and/or telephone number) and any other non-public information that is used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual, and any other non-public information that is associated with that information. “Anonymous Information” means information that is not used or intended to be used to personally identify an individual.

**BY USING OUR SITE OR SERVICES OR SUBMITTING PERSONAL INFORMATION THROUGH OUR SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT AND YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION ACCORDING TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY. YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE PROCESSED BY US IN THE COUNTRY WHERE IT WAS COLLECTED AS WELL AS OTHER COUNTRIES (INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES) WHERE LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY.**

**Children**.  
The Site and Services are not directed to children and children are not eligible to use our Services. Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us. We do not collect Personal Information from people we actually know are under 13 years of age. If we later learn that a user is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to prevent the user from utilizing the Site and the Services.

**COLLECTED INFORMATION**  
You are not required to provide any Personal Information to use our Site or Services. We only collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily. For example, if you communicate with us through our Site or by sending us an email, we may collect and store any information that is contained in your communications with us. In general, the Personal Information we gather enables us to provide the Services to you.

 _Any donation you make on the Site is made through Crowdrise, our third party donation platform, and we are not involved in this donation transaction_

. We do not take a fee or receive any information associated with your transaction, other than your email address, which you provide to both our provider and to us. Similarly, if you wish to provide comments for content on the Site or share content via email with your friends or contacts, we use a third party provider to provide you and other users with that functionality. Any Personal Information you provide through these features will not be collected by us – even for comments that may appear on our Site. Please review the privacy policy of our service providers prior to providing any Personal Information, and please be careful when disclosing Personal Information about yourself.

 _Anonymous Information_

We collect the following types of Anonymous Information:

_Information Collected by Our Servers_. To make our Site and Services more useful to you, our servers (which may be hosted by a third party service provider) collect information from you, including your browser type, operating system, Internet Protocol (“ **IP** ”) address (a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet, which may vary from session to session), domain name, and/or a date/time stamp for your visit.

_Log Files_. As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes IP addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (“ **ISP** ”), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the Site, track users’ movements around the Site, gather demographic information about our user base as a whole, and better tailor our Services to our users’ needs. For example, some of the information may be collected so that when you visit the Site or the Services again, it will recognize you and the information could then be used to serve advertisements and other information appropriate to your interests.

_Cookies_. Like many online services, we use cookies to collect information. “ **Cookies** ” are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing the website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our Site. This type of information is collected to make the Site more useful to you and to tailor the experience with us to meet your special interests and needs. If you decide at any time that you no longer wish to accept cookies from our Service for any of the purposes described above, then you can instruct your browser, by changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. Consult your browser’s technical information. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Services or all functionality of the Services.

_Collection of Information by Advertisers_. We may use third parties to serve ads on the Site. Certain third parties may automatically collect information about your visits to this and other websites, your IP address, your ISP, the browser you use to visit our Site (but not your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number). They do this by using Cookies or other technologies. Information collected may be used, among other things, to deliver advertising targeted to your interests and to better understand the usage and visitation of our Site and the other sites tracked by these third parties. This policy does not apply to, and we are not responsible for, Cookies or pixel tags in third party ads, and we encourage you to check the privacy policies of advertisers and/or ad services to learn about their use of Cookies and other technologies. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: <http://www.aboutads.info/choices>.

_Disclosure – Third Party Cookies_  
We use third party services such as Google Analytics to help analyze how users use the Site. These services use Cookies to collect information such as how often users visit the Site, what pages they visit, and what other sites they used prior to coming to the Site. We use the information we get from these service providers to improve our Site and Services. They generally collect only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit the Site or Services, rather than your name or other personally identifying information. We do not combine this information with your Personal Information. The service provider’s ability to use and share information it collects is restricted by its applicable terms and privacy policy.
