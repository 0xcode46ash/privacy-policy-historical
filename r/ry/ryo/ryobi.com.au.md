      2. it will then apply through your acceptance of it by subsequent or continued use of the Platform and/or our Services.

      3. type of computer; 
      4. type of web browser; and 
      5. other logs (collectively Traffic Data). 
    3. Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes (including screen pop-ups) or for improving your experience on the Platform. We also use “cookies” to customize content specific to your interests and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Platform.

      7. information about your computer and Internet connections using cookies.
    5. To ensure that we always provide an easy and reliable online experience for you, we rely on small pieces of information that are stored on your device. These small files are called cookies and they are used to make your online experience as good as it can be.
    6. For example, cookies can be used to: 
      1. recognise your device so that you do not have to enter your information several times during one task;
      2. recognise what you have added to your wishlist so that you do not have to keep adding the same items to your wishlist during your next visit;
