## 5\. Web Site Navigational Information

Due to Internet communications standards, when you visit or use the Web site, we automatically receive the URL of the website from which you came and the website to which you go when you leave the Rypple Web site. We also receive your computer’s Internet Protocol (IP) address (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system, the type of web browser you are using, and your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This information is used to analyze overall trends to help us improve the Rypple Service.

The Web site uses "cookies" to track Web site usage, to enable you to sign in to the Services, and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk through your web browser via a webpage server.  It contains information about you that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies allow Rypple to recognize you as a visitor or user when you return to our Web site or use the Services using the same computer and web browser. Rypple uses cookies to store your preferences so that you do not have to repeatedly enter the same information, and to display your personalized content. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies or configure acceptance of cookies.  If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use all of the interactive features of the Web site or the Rypple Services that depend on cookies. 

We use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A “persistent" cookie, is set once you’ve logged in to your Rypple user account and remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. The next time you visit the Web site, the persistent cookie will allow us to recognize you as an existing user so that you do not need to log in to the Service again. If you log out of the Rypple Web site, however, you will need to re-enter your password the next time you wish to access your Account. A “session” cookie is used to enhance or customize a particular visit to the Rypple site. Session cookies expire after a short time or when you close your web browser.

We employ, or our third party advertising partner employs, clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs). Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that, like cookies, track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, clear gifs are embedded on Web pages and are about the size of a pixel. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to certain personally identifiable information of our customers, users and Web site visitors in order to assess the effectiveness of our content.  In particular, we use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which email alerts have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our communications and marketing campaigns.

Rypple may collect aggregated data regarding the use of the Services, including, without limitation, number of visitors to the Web site, frequency and patterns of use, tag usage, feedback request trends, etc. ("Aggregated Data"). Rypple uses this data as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. Aggregated Data enables us to figure out how often users use certain parts of the Web site or the Services so that we can improve them. Rypple may make use of, or make such Aggregated Data available to third parties, in any manner in its sole discretion.

## 6\. Public Forums, Refer a Friend, and Customer Testimonials

Rypple may provide bulletin boards, blogs, or chat rooms on the Rypple Web site.  Any information you choose to submit in such forums may be read, collected, or used by others who visit these forums, and may be used to send you unsolicited messages.  Rypple is not responsible for the information you choose to submit to these forums. 

To request removal of your information from such forums, contact us at [privacy@rypple.com](mailto:privacy@rypple.com).  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. We may maintain copies of such information for our records. 

## 7\. International Transfers of Personal Information

To facilitate Rypple’s global operations, Rypple may transfer and access Personal Information from around the world, including the United States.  This Privacy Statement shall apply even if Personal Information is transferred to other countries.
