# Lycos Zone Privacy Vow

Â  | 

**[Home](https://web.archive.org/)**

  
|  [](https://www.truste.org/validate/1031) |  Lycos, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: LycosZone.   
---|---  
**TRUSTe Certified**  
LycosZone is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because this site wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe children's seal, LycosZone has agreed that when attempting to collect or use information from children under 13, this web site will: 

1\. NOT collect personally identifiable online or offline contact information without prior parental consent 

2\. NOT distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent 

3\. NOT give the ability to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent 

4\. NOT entice by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity 

  
**Does LycosZone use cookies?**  
LycosZone sets a user cookie when a person visits our pages. The only thing it does is turn on our SearchGuard product, which offers safe, filtered searching for kids. The cookie does not collect any personal information from the users. LycosZone also does not recognize some cookies that are set elsewhere on Lycos.com. For example, people who visit Lycos from certain Internet service providers may see a special view of Lycos.com that includes branding and images specific to that ISP. LycosZone does not participate in this program, and does not interact with any other Lycos cookies. Visitors can turn the cookies off in their browser. LycosZone will still let them in. They will lose SearchGuard functionality. 

**What about IP addresses?**  
LycosZone collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. No broad demographic info is collected. We don't track all the pages viewed by individuals, so we don't really "track" their movement. 

**Who is collecting information?**  
LycosZone does not collect any information. We don't share specifics. If advertisers ask, they can get info on the IP address the visitor came from (AOL, MindSpring etc.) or the type of browser used. But most don't care about or ask for such info.  
All of the homework, news, fun, parents and teachers zones are available for free, without you having to disclose any information about yourself. 

Most of this site does contain links to other sites. LycosZone is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. We encourage parents to participate in their child's Internet experience. Children should never give away any information about themselves without getting their parents permission. Here's the list of our co-branded sites and the extent of information requested from users: 

**BONUS** \- Request nickname, birth date, email, zip code, country. Requires parents' email to register kids under 14. Their Privacy Policy states that "Under no circumstances do we rent or sell information about our registered visitors to any outside third party. All personally identifiable information is collected for our own purposes to help us better shape our content to meet the preferences of our audience." 

**BOOKADVENTURE** \- At Home Registration - Name, First initial of last name. Requires parents email consent in order for children to receive prizes. Classroom Registration - Teachers need to register children. Their privacy Policy states that "Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, Book Adventure does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party, for any purpose whatsoever." 

**CYBERSURFARI** \- Teachers need to create teams and then register students. The only required information to enter a student is first name and T-shirt size. Cybersurfari's Privacy Policy states that "Players Under 15 -- To participate as a family team in the contests, players under 15 must have an adult supervisor. They are asked to provide some limited information for the sole purpose of submitting treasure codes and receiving prizes if eligible. These data are submitted voluntarily." 

**CELEBRITYSIGHTINGS** \- Kids can register to become members of the VIP Fan Club. It is a paying membership and credit card number is required to apply. 

**RAMS** \- Registration requires full name, email, and phone number. Registration is required to access some of the content. 

  
**Notification of Changes**  
LycosZone does not collect any information. If we decide to change the policy we would inform users with a statement on our site. 

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact LycosZone site coordinator at [webmaster@lycos.com](mailto:webmaster@lycos.com).
