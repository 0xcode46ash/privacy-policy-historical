We may share information about you with other companies in the Raymond James family – that is, companies that are owned by Raymond James Financial. That may include information shared by the Heritage Family of Funds with Raymond James broker/dealers and investment advisors, and information shared among other Raymond James financial service providers, such as Financial Advisors and insurance and annuity consultants.
