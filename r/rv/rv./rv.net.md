**Types of information we collect and how we collect it.**

The majority of the product and service information posted on our sites is offered without our collecting any personally identifiable information from you. You can surf the Web sites and view much of our content anonymously. 

**Information You Provide**

There are a few activities on our sites where the collection of personally identifiable information is necessary. Those activities include things like entering a contest or sweepstakes, making a purchase, requesting a catalog or other information, registering to our sites or the Open Roads Forum or contacting us. We do not market to or knowingly collect information from children. Therefore our customer information does not apply to anyone under thirteen years of age. 

When personally identifiable information is collected, you will know because you will have to fill out a form. For most activities, we collect only your name, e-mail address, street address, zip code, birth date, and RV type. When you make a purchase, we also collect your billing address, your phone number, and credit card information. 

**Information Collected from You with Technology**

Our sites collect some information about you using technology, so it may not be readily apparent to you that it is being collected. For instance, when you come to our site your IP address is collected so that we know where to send information you are requesting. An IP address is often associated with the place from which you enter the Internet like your ISP (Internet Service Provider), your company, or your university. This information is not personally identifiable. Our sites use information collected through technology to make our sites more interesting and useful to you. This includes helping advertisers on our site design advertisements our users might like. We normally don't combine this type of information with personally identifiable information. However, we will combine this information with personally identifiable information to identify a visitor in order to enforce compliance with our house rules or terms of service or to protect our service, site, users, or others. 

**Description of Cookies, and How We Use Them**

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer while you are viewing the Web site. These pieces of information allow the Web sites to remember important information that will make your use of those sites more useful. Our sites and other Web sites use cookies for a variety of purposes. 

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer) settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your browser's Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If you turn cookies off, you won't have access to many of our features that make your Web experience more efficient. 

**How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect**

We use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, we use your information to process your order, or if you contact us for help we will use the information to contact you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a game or contest. Information we collect is used to send you e-mail updates related to clubs, products and services and newsletters about our sites. We also use the information you provide to send you RV or outdoor-related e-mail promotions and special offers from our third-party sponsors. 

**Who We Share our Information With**

One of the most valuable assets of our business is you. We aren't in the business of selling information about our users. However, if there is a value for our users, we will share your information or send you messages on behalf of another company as described below. We will also share information for security reasons. 

Sometimes we hire companies to help us deliver products or services, like a shipping company that delivers a package. In those instances, we need to share your information with them. These companies are basically "standing in our shoes", and they are allowed to use the information only to deliver the product or service. 

On occasion, we offer promotions -- like sweepstakes or free subscriptions -- in conjunction with a sponsor. We will share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product, such as a magazine subscription. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions they offer, but only if we have your permission to do so, and we will share it only with that specific sponsor. In addition, we will occasionally send e-mail promotions out to our users on behalf of third-party sponsors to conduct promotions regarding lifestyle-related products or services. Again, we only send these promotions to you if we have your permission. 

**Content Providers**

On some of our sites, we provide content that is created by a third-party Web site. In some instances the third-party sites will collect information in order to facilitate the transaction or to make the use of their content more productive and efficient. In these circumstances the information collected is shared between our third-party sponsors and us. 

**Third-Party Advertisers and Network Advertisers**

To help increase privacy protections for our users, we allow advertising on our sites from only those companies that have their own privacy policy. Once you've clicked on an advertisement and have left our sites, our privacy policy no longer applies. You must read the privacy policy of the advertiser to see how your personal information will be handled on their site. 

In addition, many business advertisements are managed and placed on our site by third-party companies. These companies are called "network advertisers." Network advertisers collect information when you click on or scan one of their banner advertisements. The information is collected using technology, so you may not realize it's being collected. The network advertisers collect this information so that they can show you ads that are more relevant and interesting to you. 

**Purchase or Sale of Businesses**

Online business is still in a very early stage and are changing and evolving rapidly. As we continually look for ways to improve our business, we may buy or sell a company. If we buy or sell a business, the names collected will likely be transferred as a part of the sale. Information about registrants will be used in the aggregate. However, if we buy a business, we will honor the requests that customers made of that business regarding e-mail communications. In the event that we sell a business, we will do everything in our power to ensure that the e-mail communications requests you made of us are honored. 

**Organizations That Help Protect the Security and Safety of our Users and our Sites**

We will give out personal information as required by law, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena; to enforce our Terms of Service, or site or game rules; or to protect the safety and security of users and our sites. 

**Choices You Have About Our Collecting, Using, and Sharing Your Information**

It is possible for you to use much of our site without giving us any personally identifiable information. When you do register with us or give us personally identifiable information, you will have an opportunity -- at the time we collect your information \-- to limit e-mail communications from us and from our third-party partners. You can request at any time that we not send future e-mail to you either by unsubscribing from the communication or by contacting us at 

[info@affinitygroup.com](mailto:info@affinitygroup.com) or calling us at (303) 728-2267. 

**The Type of Security We Provide**

The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with our users is of utmost concern to us. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. When you provide credit card information, we use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption to protect it. There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the Web so that other people using the same computer won't have access to your information. 

**How You Can Access Your Account Information**

You can contact us via email by clicking "Contact Us" on any of our Web pages or send an email directly to 

[info@affinitygroup.com](mailto:info@affinitygroup.com) . Please include information in the email that will help us identify your account so we can assist you with your inquiry or request.
