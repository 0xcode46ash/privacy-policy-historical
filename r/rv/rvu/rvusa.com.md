### What information do you collect?

**Personal Information:**  
We require personal contact information and vehicle information from our customers. The required information is used to effectively and accurately create, maintain, and display RVUSA.com’s RV vehicle for sale database, and to track and verify users in our forums. The required vehicle information we collect is only that which is necessary to accurately search and display your vehicle in our database. Information collected to access our forums is used to validate users and the display of any personal information such as e-mail address is optional based on the users choice.

**Cookies:**  
Currently, the RVUSA.com website does not use cookies to track visitor activities on our website. Any changes to that policy will be reflected by a change in our Privacy Policy.

### How do you collect information?

Members are requested to submit personal and vehicle information using the forums and RV Listing services. Credit Card and billing information will only be collected for services that RVUSA.com charges a fee for. Users unwilling to pass personal information online for our paid services can choose to work with a customer service representative via phone. All free services require the use of our online registration.

### How information will be used?

**Resale and Disclosure of Information**  
RVUSA.com is a division of NetSource Media. RVUSA.com and NetSource Technologies, Inc do not sell, share or disclose any information collected from our visitors with any outside parties other than the transmission of credit card billing information with our credit card processing company.

RVUSA.com reserves the right to include third party advertisements that provide additional services to members in the confirmation emails.
