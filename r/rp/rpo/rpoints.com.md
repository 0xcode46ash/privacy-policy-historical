This Privacy Policy needs to be read in conjunction with our [Terms of Use](http://www.rpoints.com/terms-and-conditions.php) and the words and phrases in this page have the same meaning as in our Terms of Use.

Data Protection Act Compliance

We respect the privacy of all our members and take handling of information seriously. We are voluntarily registered under the UK Data Protection Act 1998 with the Information Commissioner's Office. Registration number: Z918442X.

What information do we collect?

We do not collect any more information from you than what is needed for providing our service. When registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your name, username and e-mail address. To prevent misuse of our service, we also log your IP address. Any more information you provide (for example method of payments) to enable us to send your cashback payments will not be shared with any third party. 

Where we collect sensitive information, we do take extreme care in doing so. Our members' account area of our site is security encrypted (256-bit Secure Sockets Layer encryption) to high standards.

We do not use any malicious software, adware or malware on our website.

What do we use this information for?

We only use the information we collect to improve our website, our customer service and provide you with our loyalty shopping service. 

By providing us your email address, you agree to receive emails regarding your account with our website and payment related information. 

Newsletters

We may also send you specially negotiated offers or discounts by email periodically as an email newsletter. You can unsubscribe to our newsletter by selecting the appropriate subscription options in your profile page or by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of our newsletter. 

Use of cookies 

Our website and our partner merchants' links may use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data or text that is sent from a web server to your browser and is stored on your computer. A cookie can't read data off your computer or read cookie files created by other sites. These cookies do not damage or harm your computer.

These cookies are essential for making sure you get the cash back for your purchases and for us to improve our website. It is necessary for our members to accept these cookies, as they are essential for the tracking to be able to earn your cashback. 

If you want to learn more about cookies and how to manage them, you can read the [BBC guide about cookies here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/webwise/guides/about-cookies "BBC guide about cookies here")

Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

**We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information.** This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website and servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. 

Third party Websites

We have partnered with many retailers to enable our members to earn discounts and cashback. When you click on our merchant links, you are taken to the merchant website and make your purchases with the merchant. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.

Privacy and Security Policy for High Street Cashback

If you do decide to register for our High Street Cashback/In-store cashback facility, the following applies.

The security of your personal data is extremely important to us. In relation to all your personal data we maintain a high level of security, in particular in relation to payment cards held.

When you enter your card details on a computer this is transmitted to us encrypted within secure webpages using SSL, Data, and Password encryption technology. Our internet web servers are certified by Digicert, a public Certificate Authority. Pages are automatically expired to cover the instance of members registering cards from internet cafes.

Your card numbers are only stored and processed in encrypted format and only the last 4 digits are visible (both to you and our customer services team). This means that if anyone does guess your email address/password combination they will not be able to see the full card number that you have registered.

Data storage on our systems and the communication between us and the financial and technology companies is in accordance with legislation and best practice within the payment card industry.

We do not take the card expiry date or security code unless you are providing a card to us specifically to take a payment (for example to transfer money to your gift card) and in that case such information would never be stored. This means that 'cardholder not present' (e.g. internet) transactions cannot be carried out with the data that we hold for you. Of course we do not know your PIN for high street transactions either.

In order to assist us to maintain your security: 

Please select a password that is not a word in the dictionary or a name associated with you, your address e.g. includes numeric digits somewhere in your password. 

Please be aware that we would never ask you in a cold call or in an unsolicited email to reveal your card number or to confirm numbers that you have previously registered. If you receive any such communication please contact our customer services team at once.

If at any stage you initiate a conversation with our customer services team about the cards registered to your account, we would only ever identify a card number (or ask you to identify one) by referring to the last 4 digits of the card.

Your Consent

By using our website, you consent to this Privacy Policy. 

Access to information

The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access information held about you. In accordance with that Act, we reserve the right to charge a small fee if you ask us to provide you with this information. If you have any questions and want us to provide this to you, please contact us using the contact details below.
