# Rpoints : What is this site's Privacy Policy?

What do we do with the information you provide?

In order to register, the only personal information you need to provide is your email address. By editing your profile, you can allow other registered members to send emails to you without revealing your email address to them. Your email address is never displayed on this site without your explicit permission.

From time to time, we may request further personal information in order to provide an enhanced service to you. You can be assured that:

\- We store your personal data securely  
\- We DO NOT pass your personal data to third parties, unless you specifically ask us to for a particular purpose (e.g. a competition) or as required by law  
\- We do not send junk mail (or spam). We send occasional site updates by email, and you can choose the type of mailings you receive by editing your profile.

We may also monitor traffic patterns and your use of the site. We use this information to provide customisation and to make general improvements to the web site. 

Use of 'cookies'?

'Cookies' are small pieces of information that are stored on your computer's hard drive by your browser. These allow us to store your details and provide features to make your use of the Service easier. Most browsers allow the cookie function to be turned off, though to get maximum benefit from the site we recommend that you allow cookies to be stored.

The software used by this site allows you to 'auto-login', so that you do not need to re-enter your password each time you visit the site. This option is enabled by checking the appropriate box on the login screen. Under no circumstances should you use this option if other people have access to the computer you are using.
