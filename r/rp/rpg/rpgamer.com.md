If you have any questions about this policy, please send an e-mail to [webmaster@rpgamer.com](mailto:webmaster@rpgamer.com). 

**Main Site**

Your IP address is logged only for internal reasons, such as web statistics, script management and administration. Individual hosts and addresses are not distributed in any form. 

This Web site contains links to other sites. RPGamer takes care to screen links for inappropriate materials, but because RPGamer does not directly control the content of linked sites, RPGamer can not be held responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

RPGamer may, from time to time, run a demographic survey. Any information collected from this survey will be to create general demographics, which will be used to help enhance the site. Individual aspects of the information will not be shared with, or sold to any third party. 

**Public Forums**

In addition to the Main Site, RPGamer also has a section for message boards. While access is not restricted, users are required to register a username and password to post on our system. Once a user posts, the IP address is then availible for administration purposes. Any additional information provided by the user is considered optional and is entered at the user's own risk. RPGamer makes no claim to the validity or responsibility of the additional information provided by the user. 

**Advertising**

RPGamer uses third parties in order to serve ads for the Web site. Currently RPGamer is seeking new advertisers. When RPGamer has located advertising, return here to view their Privacy Policies as well.
