The opportunity to share one's personally identifying information has been made available on the Rudolph Technologies website to make it easier to request information or materials concerning the company's products and services and to serve the requestor's needs. Rudolph Technologies also collects certain anonymous information that cannot be associated with any individual personally, such as the number of visitors to the company's website and the number of visitors requesting information. Rudolph Technologies may analyze this data to evaluate trends and statistics and to help the company assess customer needs in order to improve the website and better serve its customers.

  
 **Opting Out**  
An individual may opt out of having Rudolph Technologies maintain their personally identifying information at any time. Anyone who has submitted personally identifying information on the Rudolph Technologies website may choose not to receive additional communications from Rudolph Technologies on the company's products, services or events that the company determines may be of further interest to the individual. If an individual initially chooses to receive information from Rudolph Technologies but then decides they want to discontinue communications from the company, they may unsubscribe at any time by simply sending an [e-mail](mailto:info@rudolphtech.com), placing the word "Unsubscribe" in the subject line and providing the details of their request. 

  
**Cookies**  
Cookies are small text files that the Rudolph Technologies website may ask to place on the computer hard drive of an individual viewing the company website. If the viewer's computer browser is set to accept cookies, then the browser can add the text in a small file. Should Rudolph Technologies employ the use of cookies, they will not be used to read other information on a viewer's computer's hard drive. Instead, the cookies may be used to confirm the access to the company website and to help Rudolph Technologies analyze the usage of its website in general. In addition, cookies could also be used if an individual submits a request with Rudolph Technologies for literature or other information. While the majority of computer browsers are initially set to accept cookies, they can be set to either refuse the placement of cookies or to provide a warning prior to the placement of a cookie.

  
 **Accuracy and Access**  
Rudolph Technologies desires to maintain the accuracy of any personally identifying information an individual has provided to the company. If an individual has submitted personally identifying information to the company and it has changed, they may [contact](https://web.archive.org/contactus.aspx) Rudolph Technologies to request a change to their personally identifying information.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**  
Under certain circumstances, Rudolph Technologies may provide personally identifying information to its business partners in order to meet the needs of the individual submitting the information. As an example, if literature is requested to be shipped to an individual, Rudolph Technologies would by necessity have to share the person's name and address with a carrier. In addition, Rudolph Technologies will release personally identifying information if the law so requires. Otherwise, Rudolph Technologies will not provide submitted personally identifying information to any third party outside of the company without an individual's consent.
