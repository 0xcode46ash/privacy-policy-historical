Therefore, Rumbo is not responsible for the failure to comply or the right fulfillment of those services which are part of the contract between the Travel Supplier and the User.

Since it is the User who engages with the Travel Supplier, all complaints or queries relating the service must be addressed to the Travel Supplier. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Rumbo offers Users its Customer Service to help them with queries and recommendations . Additionally, Rumbo accepts each and every liability or prohibition under the current legislation concerning the exclusion or limitation of professional liability in the fulfillment of the intermediary contract.

With the purpose that the User can access the comparison of the desired services, Users expressly accept that Rumbo takes the necessary steps, on their behalf, with the Travel Supplier in order to make the comparison possible.

The security measures taken by Rumbo are adequate. However, the User must be aware that security measures of the computer systems across the Internet are not completely reliable and service depends on internal and external elements.

In order to preserve possible intellectual property rights, if any User or third part considers that her/his rights have been violated by any content introduced on the Website, the User must notify Rumbo of it, providing:

  * In order to preserve possible intellectual property rights, if any User or third part considers that her/his rights have been violated by any content introduced on the Website, the User must notify Rumbo of it, providing:

  * Contents protected by intellectual property rights and their location on the Website.
  * Enough accreditation of intellectual property rights.
  * Express statement that the interested party is responsible for the truthfulness of the information provided.



## 5\. Force majeure

Rumbo will not be responsible for non-fulfillments or damages caused as consequence of circumstances beyond Rumbo’s control, coercion or unforeseen circumstance, which include, not limited to, strike, industrial dispute, war (whether declared or not) or war threat or preparations for war, invasion, rallies, terrorist attack or threat, terrorist activities, riots, natural disasters, adverse weather conditions, hurricane, earthquake, fire, snowstorm, explosion, storm, sinking, epidemic, impossibility of using trains, boats, planes, motor transportation or any other means of transport, public or private, impossibility of using telecommunication systems, unexpected breakdown, transport accidents, etc.

## 6\. Links to other websites

Within the Website, Rumbo may place at the User’s disposal links to other websites, managed and monitored by third parts. Rumbo does not sponsor nor guarantee any of these websites, which have been included for the User’s benefit. Therefore, Rumbo does not assume any responsibility, not even indirect or subsidiary, for any damage which may arise from access, maintenance, use, quality, legitimacy, reliability and usefulness of the contents, information, communications, opinions, statements, products or services existing in or offered by the websites not managed by Rumbo and accessible through the Website.

Users accept that Rumbo reserves the right to remove at any time and without prior notice the links that appear at the Website.

## 7\. Website content provided by users

Rumbo is not responsible for the content or any transmission included by the Users on the Website, or among Users. The responsibility of the statements spread on the Website is exclusive of those who make them.

It is forbidden any kind of data transfer made by the Users in the Website or other accesses controlled by Rumbo which go against practice in good faith, against customs, moral or public order; which break third part copyrights; which are threatening, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, racist, xenophobic, indecent, disrespectful or illegal; which involve statements in defense of terrorism; which threaten human rights. And it is also forbidden the transfer of any other material which constitutes a criminal offense or incites to a conduct which can be considered as such.

It is forbidden to sell or advertise any kind of product or service, to conduct surveys, polls or contests and to send chain emails.

As a rule, Rumbo does not revise, filter or approve content by Users. Notwithstanding the aforementioned, Rumbo reserves the right to remove any content provided by Users which go against these General Conditions, as well as to prevent or prohibit access to the Website. This will be done at Rumbo’s discretion, without prior notice and the User will have no right to damages.

If the User believes, at any time, that the contents provided by other User do not follow these General Conditions, she/he can notify it to Rumbo’s Customer Service by mail. Upon reception of this kind of notification, Rumbo will do its best to remove from the Website those contents which may infringe these General Conditions.

If required by a court order or by the proper authorities, Rumbo will cooperate in the identification of those responsible for the illegal contents.

The User authorizes Rumbo to use her/his contents and images in the Website for free, whether as a whole or partly. All this with the limitation and exception of the use and application which may go against the right of honor, moral and/or public order under the current legislation in each country. Rumbo is exempt of responsibilities for any use made by a third part of these contents.

## 8\. Severability

Due to the decentralization of the legal framework affecting the activity of travel agencies, these General Conditions may be subject to different regulations and jurisdictions. Should any condition of these General Conditions be null, its validity would not be affected by this circumstance.

The non-effective condition will be substituted by a new one, or interpreted in a legally acceptable way which will be as close to the original sense as possible, had the inefficiency of the said condition been known.

## 9\. Enforceability

The fact that Rumbo, at one time, may not demand the User to fulfill one of the General Conditions will not affect at all Rumbo’s right to demand its fulfillment at a later time or the right of a third part to demand its fulfillment.

Any waiver on Rumbo’s part to any right or power granted by the General Conditions must be in writing. The omission on Rumbo’s part to demand the strict enforcement of any condition will not be considered as a waiver, nor will deprive Rumbo of the right to demand, at a later time, the strict enforcement of them.

## 10\. Law and jurisdiction

All terms and conditions on these General Conditions are ruled by the Spanish law and the parties, waiving their own jurisdiction, submit themselves to the Courts of Madrid for any action or claim which could arise from this relationship, provided no specific jurisdiction is established by law.

Rumbo offers the User the possibility to access its Website in different languages. Nevertheless, should any contradiction arise between the different versions of these General Conditions, the Spanish version will prevail over the rest.
