Why?                                  Financial companies choose how they share your personal information.
                                      Federal law gives consumers the right to limit some, but not all sharing.
                                      Federal law also requires us to tell you how we collect, share and protect
                                      your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to understand
                                      what we do.
