# Privacy Policy

This privacy statement applies specifically to the Website and member communications facilities of Reading University Students' Union (RUSU)

The facilities contain public areas which may be viewed from any Internet connected PC. Other areas are restricted to access by members of RUSU. It's important to RUSU that its members and customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all that RUSU and its services have to offer. Your privacy is important to us. We therefore operate on the basis of a number of principles:

**Principle 1**. The information you give us in registering your membership of RUSU, will be stored securely. This web-site is hosted by a third party who is under obligation to hold the information securely and confidentially in compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998 and is prohibited from making use of the information itself. If any of the information you have given us changes at any time, you can directly change this record yourself by clicking the 'my profile' button in the top right hand box on your page, after you are logged in. You can set your own preferences for information receipt and can change these at any time. Thus for example, should you choose not to 'opt-in' for news of 'What's On', no specific communications on that subject will be sent to you.

**Principle 2**. RUSU will use this information to communicate with you by e-mail, or by text message, to improve our website and to personalise our service to you. For example we may provide you with newsletters, activity information, pointers, advice, recommendations or advertisements for goods or services that we think will interest you, according to the preferences you have determined. We will also use the information for our own internal membership administration and for statistical analysis.

**Principle 3**. We will not however disclose, sell, rent or otherwise exchange any information personal to you to any third party without your prior express approval. The only exceptions to this shall be in order to comply with our legal obligations, to enforce the terms and conditions of use of our website or to protect and defend the rights and interests of property of RUSU, the University, or another member.

**Principle 4**. RUSU will not store in or transfer your personal data to countries outside the United Kingdom.

**Principle 5**. By disclosing information about yourself to use on our website or in any other way, you consent to the use of that information in the manner set out in this policy.

**Principle 6.** As required by Data Protection legislation, RUSU has notified the Data Protection Commissioner of the types of information we hold, the purposes for which we hold it and the third parties to whom we may disclose it.
