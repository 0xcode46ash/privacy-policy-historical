**How does Ruby Lane use my personal information?** Back to Top.  


Ruby Lane uses personal information as appropriate in the normal course of our business to provide the products and services you have requested. We also use this information to provide positive identification of you when you contact us. On occasion, we also send account statements, Email updates on services and other materials we believe may be of importance or interest. 

Ruby Lane also uses personal information to provide you, the user, with a personalized web experience when visiting our site. By knowing a little about you, Ruby Lane is able to deliver more relevant content and advertisements, and hence a better service, to you. 

  
**What if I make a purchase at a Ruby Lane Shop?** Back to Top.  


If you purchase or make offers in one of our Ruby Lane Shops, we may collect personal information including your credit card number and shipping information. This information will be used by the merchant to complete the transaction. Ruby Lane is only a venue and does not own the shops. All transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the merchant. For further information regarding the merchant's use of customer information, contact that merchant shop directly. 

  
**Will Ruby Lane disclose any of my personal information?** Back to Top.  


Ruby Lane will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Ruby Lane. 

Ruby Lane may disclose personal information, but only when it is clearly stated at the time we ask for the information, such as during a shop registration, or in the rules of a giveaway or other promotions. 

Ruby Lane does disclose user statistics to describe our audience to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. These statistics are always anonymous and never related back to specific users. For example, we may disclose that 20% of our audience are doll collectors, but we would not release a list of email addresses for this group (or any other). 

If you make a purchase or offer through a shop hosted by Ruby Lane, the information that you provide may be provided to the owner of that shop to complete the transaction. These shop owners have their own, separate privacy and data collection policies independent of Ruby Lane, and Ruby Lane has no responsibility or liability in connection with these. 

Other Ruby Lane partners, such as Internet sites and services accessible through Ruby Lane or parties whom we inform you are collecting data in connection with giveaway or other promotions, have their own, separate privacy and data collection practices independent of Ruby Lane, and Ruby Lane has no responsibility or liability in connection with these. 

  
**Does Ruby Lane use Cookies?** Back to Top.  


The term "cookies" refers to very small bits of information that a web site such as Ruby Lane may store on your computer. This information is then sent back to us (and only to us) the next time you visit our web site. 

Ruby Lane uses cookies to: 

  * Access information about past visits to our site so that we can deliver a more personalized service to you. 
  * Access information on our computers to maintain your account, if you have registered with us.

  * Determine how often you visit our site. 
  * Target ads based on your interests. 



Advertising services Ruby Lane uses, such as Commission Junction, LinkShare or BFree, and other sites we partner with, may also use cookies. 

  
**How does Ruby Lane use my IP address?** Back to Top.  


IP addresses are the unique ID assigned to your computer while connected to the Internet, for example, 207.7.75.45 is an IP address.

Ruby Lane uses IP addresses for system administration (for example, tracking down problems accessing our web site) and to determine which parts of our site are most frequently accessed. IP addresses are never released to third parties.
