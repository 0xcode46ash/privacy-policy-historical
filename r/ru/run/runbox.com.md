# PrivacyPolicy < RunboxInfo < TWiki

_Updated 07.08.2008_

The personal information collected from you through the Runbox Mail Manager is subject to the Privacy Policy as described in this document. Runbox reserves the right to change this policy without prior notification. 

##  Account information 

When registering for Runbox Mail Manager you are asked to provide certain information, such as your name and contact information. Some information is required for registration, but other information is optional and may be given at your descretion. The information will be used to customize the presentation of the service, configure certain parts of the service, and communicate directly with you should it be necessary. You may update this information at any time by clicking the "Account" button on the navigation bar. 

Your account information and your email are stored on the Runbox servers while your Runbox account is active and thereafter, whether or not you choose to deactivate your account. This is done as a service to you should you decide to reactivate your account or wish to access your Runbox email in case your subscription expires. We will of course delete your account information and email entirely from our servers upon request. 

Your Account information is private and will not be shared with any third parties. Runbox will not access or disclose your Account information except with your permission or unless acting under a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: 

  * conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process 
  * protect and defend the rights or property of Runbox 
  * enforce the Runbox Mail Manager Terms of Service 
  * act to protect the interests of members or others 
  * administer, maintain, and improve the service 



Runbox may, from time to time, email you regarding changes or improvements to our services, or offers you might be interested in. 

##  Computer and session information 

Runbox Mail Manager utilizes cookies, an industry standard used by most major web sites, to simplify the connection and data transfer between the client (user) and the server (our web site) by simulating a continuous connection. A cookie is a small piece of data sent from the server to the client (and in some circumstances from the client to the server), enabling users to access the web site without having to reintroduce themselves with every mouse click. Web sites can thus "remember" information about users to facilitate their preferences for a particular site and allow the use of user passwords. Web browsers are usually set up to accept cookies. You can set yours up to refuse cookies if you prefer, though you may not be able to take full advantage of a web site if you do. 

##  Anonymous information 

Additionally, Runbox gathers anonymous information through traffic data, cookies, and IP addresses or other numeric codes. This information is for system administration and helps us aggregate and keep track of statistics which is useful in our continual effort to improve our service. 

##  Security 

Your information is stored in secure databases and is password protected so that only you have access to your Account information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Runbox will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. 

Remember to log out of your Runbox Mail Manager account every time you have finished using the service. This ensures that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence at the computer you use. 

Runbox is a global company and Runbox Mail Manager has users all over the world. Information you submit while using our service may be sent electronically and used, stored, and processed outside of the country you accessed our web site from. While Runbox strives to ensure that your information is treated securely, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Runbox cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. 

For more information about how Runbox protects your online privacy, please contact us at [info@runbox.com](http://www.runbox.com/mail/compose?to=info@runbox.com) .
