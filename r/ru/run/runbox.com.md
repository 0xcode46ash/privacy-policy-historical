# Privacy Policy - Runbox

_Updated 29.05.2015. Effective 01.07.2015._

Runbox Solutions AS (“Runbox Solutions”), a company incorporated and located in Norway, provides users with email, web, and domain hosting services (the “Service”). The personal data collected from you through the Service is processed according to this Privacy Policy and the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms-service/).

The Privacy Policy is compliant with the guidelines issued by [The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA)](http://www.datatilsynet.no/English/), an independent public agency established for protecting individuals’ right to privacy regarding their personal data.

Runbox Solutions may change the Privacy Policy at any time with 30 days prior notice.

##  General

###  Purpose of processing

When registering an account with the Service you are asked to provide certain information, such as your name and contact information. Some information is required in order for us to deliver the Service and fulfill our obligations to you, while other information may be given at your discretion and is marked as optional.

The information will also be used to customize the Service for you, to maintain the quality of the Service, for anonymous, statistical purposes, and to provide us with an alternate means of contacting you if necessary.

###  Legal basis

The Service is subject to and compliant with the laws and regulations of the Kingdom of Norway, the [Personal Data Act](https://www.datatilsynet.no/English/Regulations/Personal-Data-Act-/), and [Personal Data Regulations](https://www.datatilsynet.no/English/Regulations/Personal-Data-Regulations/).

You can find more information about Norway’s privacy regulations at [The Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA)](http://www.datatilsynet.no/English/). None of the data collected through the Service is sensitive by the definition of the law, and therefore not subject to notification to the DPA.

###  Responsibility of processing

Runbox Solutions, by the managing director, is responsible for the personal data registered. This responsibility includes ensuring that personal data is processed according to Norwegian laws and regulations.

###  Data Protection Officer

In accordance with the recommendations from the DPA, Runbox Solutions has appointed an internal Data Protection Officer (DPO), whose main responsibility is to ensure that the company follows the privacy regulations specified in the Personal Data Act, Section 11.

The DPO also serves as liaison between Runbox Solutions and the DPA. Runbox Solutions’ DPO is authorized by the DPA, which allows Runbox Solutions to use the official Data Protection Officer logo.

##  Account Information

###  Registration

You consent to provide us with the following personal data when you register an account: First name, last name, company name (where applicable), mobile phone number (where applicable), country, and alternative email address.

You may update this information at any time in the “Account” section in the Service.

###  **Storage and deletion**

All your Account Information is stored on servers located in Norway and can be deleted upon request after closure of the account. Account Information is otherwise kept after account closure in case claims or complaints are set forth by former customers or users, and in order to provide former customers and users with news and offers. You can opt out of such communication by contacting Runbox Support.

Runbox Solutions does not store credit card information because we have outsourced credit card transactions to an external payment gateway. The payment gateway does not collect or store personal details.

Accounts are non-transferrable, but relatives of a deceased account owner may request deletion of the account upon presenting official documentation and identification.

##  Account Content

###  Email services

Email service content (data associated with Webmail, Contacts, and Files in the Service) is stored in main storage on servers located in Norway for as long as your account is active and:

  * up to 3 months after closure of trial accounts; or
  * up to 6 months after closure of subscribed accounts.



This is done as a service in case you should decide to reactivate your account or wish to access your email if your subscription expires by mistake. In this period of quarantine, your data will not be available unless you resubscribe to the Service.

You can however request to have your email data deleted (and your account terminated) immediately by contacting Runbox Support.

Backup is stored on secure servers separate from the Runbox system for up to 6 months, even after the content has been deleted from the main storage, except for accounts that activated the “No backup” feature more than 6 months prior to this.

In order to provide virus and spam protection, incoming and outgoing email might be automatically scanned. Additionally, automatic indexing of email contents occurs in order to provide email search facilities.

###  Web hosting

If you choose to use Runbox Web Hosting, the data you upload and your Runbox email address will be stored on the web hosting server which is located in the US (default) and in Norway. No personal data will be stored on the web hosting server automatically.

###  Domain names

If you register a domain name via the Service, your personal data will be stored with the registrar in the US (default), Norway, or other countries depending on the Top-level Domain (TLD) and your preference. For details, please see this page: [https://runbox.com/price-plans/domain-price-list/domains-how-your-details-used/](https://web.archive.org/price-plans/domain-price-list/domains-how-your-details-used/)

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer or mobile device. The cookies allows the website to “remember” your actions or preferences over time.

Runbox Solutions’ hosting provider and ISP do not log any traffic to or from our servers.

###  **No web beacons**

We do not use web beacons. Web beacons are transparent pixel images that are used in collecting information about website usage, e-mail response, and tracking.

##  Confidentiality

###  **Secure transmission**

No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although Runbox Solutions strives to employ the strongst security technologies available we cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and we recommend [encrypting](https://help.runbox.com/encrypting-your-runbox-email/) your messages if you are concerned about email being intercepted in transit.

###  **Safe Harbor Principles**

[Safe Harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles) is the name of a policy agreement established between the United States Department of Commerce and the European Union (E.U.) in November 2000 to regulate the way that U.S. companies handle the personal data (such as names and addresses) that is transmitted from Europe.

As a Norwegian company, Runbox Solutions is not subject to the principles included in the agreement. However, Runbox Solutions fulfills the requirements stated in those principles.
