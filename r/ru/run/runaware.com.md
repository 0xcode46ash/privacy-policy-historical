# Privacy : RUNAWARE

  | 

**Runaware's integrity policy**  
Runaware will be collecting data about users visiting and testing software on our site. It is, however, important to us that you do not perceive this as an abuse of your trust in any way. We would therefore like to be open about the sort of data we are collecting, who will be accessing it and how you can correct and amend it.  
    We would also like to add that the stipulations of our integrity policy may change, which is why it may be a good idea for you to revisit and read it again from time to time. 

**Why we are collecting user data**  
Runaware enables users worldwide to test out different programs on the Internet. Our business concept is based on providing the service to our users free of charge. In exchange, the companies presenting their programs on the site have access to information about the traffic around their own software. 

**Three categories of collected data**  
The data collected on Runaware's site is forwarded to the software companies that use the site to present their programs. The data we collect can largely be divided into three categories - membership information, number information and information about users that expressly request more information about certain software.  
    The number information comprises the number of visitors that have chosen to test a particular software, when this took place and test time length. No information related to ID or personal details is issued.  
    If, on the other hand, a user requests more information about one or more software products, this information is forwarded to the party that can fulfil this request - usually the producer or its local retailer. The voluntary information includes name, country and e-mail.  
    Membership information is mainly used by Runaware itself. Besides gaining unlimited testing times, those opting for membership also get a vote - the possibility to influence developments. By communicating with our members, we hope to develop the site's design and content.  
    All information submission is voluntary. If you have not expressly given your authorization, no information will be released. And, if you so wish, it is also fully possible to change any information you have submitted. 

**We protect our customers**  
All information you submit to us is treated with all the security offered by today's technology. We adhere to the security regulations and legislation required to guarantee correct storage and issuing of information, so that nothing happens concerning your personal details.
