4\. PRICES AND SHIPPING FEES

All prices are clearly shown on our websites. Prices can be changed frequently. The valid prices for each order are based on the moment the order has been placed. 

Prices are shown as follow: 

\- For orders being shipped to countries within the European Union, VAT is already included in the product price you see on our website. So VAT and any sales taxes are already included and you will only be charged the product price and the shipping fees. 

\- For orders being shipped to countries outside of the European Union, no VAT and no sales tax will be included in the product prices you see on our website and you will not be charged any taxes by us. However your packages may be subject to the customs fees and import duties of the country to which your order is shipped to. So the courier will charge you any taxes or customs directly. As taxes and customs may also depend on product category as well as declared amount, we are not able to provide you with any further details. We would recommend you to consult your local Customs office, which will happily assist you with further information. 

Our prices are shown by the selected delivery country. Our shipping fees are calculated by weight and volume, so by adding any item to the basket, the respective shipping fees are shown and the delivery option can be selected, once all items have been added to the basket. Your order will be shipped by the selected courier and you will receive your tracking information per mail. Tradeinn alerts to annul orders for products with wrong and/or obviously surreal prices although this orders might have been accepted primarily. 

Tradeinn offers a great range of items, most of them are in stock other have to be ordered on demand. So when selecting an item an estimated delivery date will be shown. If the item is in stock, you will find the information directly next to the estimated delivery date. The estimated delivery date is calculated by product availability and shipping time. So the estimated delivery date is calculated by our experience with each supplier and chosen courier. If you order several items in one order, the estimated delivery date will be calculated by availability of all of them.

The estimated delivery date has been calculated as per availability of all items from your order. The taken time from dispatch to delivery depends on the courier service you select at the checkout. 

The estimated delivery date is only a reference, as it is determined to product availability, courier’s availability, as well as payment.   
In case Tradeinn has to withdraw an item because it has become obsolete or has been discontinued, you will be informed directly. If Tradeinn can offer any similar item you will directly receive the proposal which you can accept or if not, cancel the item/order for a refund of the paid product price. 

Tradeinn does not accept any liability for any delay or not further availability of ordered products.

5\. DELIVERY

When placing an order, you can choose your delivery option once all items have been added to the basket. Tradeinn will ship your order to the address you provided when placing your order. To ensure the safe delivery of your parcel, the courier company needs a signature to confirm successful delivery. If there is nobody to receive the parcel, the driver will either attempt a new delivery, deposit your parcel at a neighbor or take your parcel to be securely held at the local Post Office or Depot. In case your parcel could not be delivered due to any reason, such as incorrect address, wrong delivery details, refuse of the parcel, etc., it will normally be returned directly to us. Please keep in mind we can only refund your paid product price, once the parcel has arrived back at our warehouse and any item could be verified.
