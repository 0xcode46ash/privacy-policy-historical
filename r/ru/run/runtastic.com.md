# Privacy Policy | Runtastic - makes sports funtastic

  1. ###  In General 

The concept of the Runtastic network is based in part on the publication of details regarding individual users to other users by making such details accessible via the Runtastic sports portal. 

    1. The collection, administration and use of personal details by Runtastic complies with applicable data protection laws by ensuring that each user is able to decide herself, which personal details shall be made accessible to other users. 
    2. Special notice regarding the „Live Tracking“-feature: The Runtastic platform includes a "Live Tracking"-feature, which, if activated by a user in her own discretion, enables third parties to see the route and data of such user's sports activity on the online sports portal www.runtastic.com. The activation of the "Live Tracking"-feature is voluntary. Unless disabled in the settings by the user, the user will be queried prior to each session whether she wants to activate the feature for such session. By activating the feature, the user accepts the responsibility for such activation at her own risk and peril. If the user does not want to give third parties access to her training route and data, then the "Live Tracking"-feature should not be activated. The user's privacy settings can be configured accordingly, via Profiles-Setting-Privacy.

Runtastic implements all reasonable measures to prevent the unauthorized access by third parties to saved details. 

The user explicitly consents to the use of non-personally identifiable information by advertising networks included in the mobile applications for the purpose of displaying banner ads (e.g., AdMobs). 

  5. ###  Privacy Policy for Usage of Facebook-Plugins (Like-Button, Comments) 

The Runtastic pages integrate plugins of the social network Facebook, 1601 South California Avenue, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. Users can recognize Facebook-plugins by the Facebook-Logo or the addition "Facebook Social Plugin" or the "Like-Button" ("Like") on our pages. You can find an overview of Facebook-plugins here: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/. 

When users visitin the Runtastic pages, the plugin establishes a connection between a user's browser/smartphone and the Facebook-server. Thereby Facebook gains information on the fact that a user with a certin IP-address has visited a Runtastic page. If a user interacts with the plugins, e. g. by clicking on the Facebook "Like-Button" or entering a comment, while being logged in to such user's Facebook-Account, a user links the contents of the Runtastic pages to her Facebook-profile. Thereby Facebook can correlate a user's visit of the Runtastic page with such user's account. Runtastic as the provider of the Runtastic pages does not have any knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its usage by Facebook. Users can find more information on that issue in the privacy policy of Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/. 

If users do not want to have Facebook correlate their visits on our site with your Facebook-account, uses must log out from their Facebook-account.
