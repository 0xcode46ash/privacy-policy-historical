Security 

Rugs Direct understands your concerns regarding Internet security. The Rugs Direct secure software encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet. 

Here's How the Secure Server Works

**1\. Starting Your Order**  
Every order at www.rugsdirect.com is secure. All data submitted via the checkout form is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption. 

**2\. Making a Positive ID**  
After you've selected items to purchase, you'll be prompted to continue your order by clicking on "Place Your Order" or "Place Order." At this point, your browser looks for a "site certificate" to confirm that it is communicating with www.rugsdirect.com. Once a positive ID is made, your order continues. 

**3\. Entering "Secure Mode"**  
At this point, your computer and our server begin communicating in secure mode, sending data back and forth in an encrypted format. We are ready to ask you for your credit card information. The encryption features of browser software are exceptionally powerful and ensure the security of this data as it is transmitted to our server. 

**4\. Your Order Is Complete**  
What Happens Next? The credit card numbers are placed in a database on the Rugs Direct web server. A user must have login privileges on the web server (requiring a password) to be able to access the database, which also requires a password. 

Order information, including the credit card numbers, is retrieved by the staff at Rugs Direct through a web interface. This interface challenges the user for a password twice, and then "expires" the session after ten minutes, requiring the user to login again. All communications during these sessions are encrypted again using SSL. No credit card numbers are ever sent via email, due to the fact that email is not secure. 

How Can You Tell If You Are In Secure Mode?

Standard, unsecured URL address begins "http://". When you enter secure mode, the beginning of the URL address will change to " **https://** "; the " **s** " stands for secure. Most browsers in secure mode also display a blue line along the top of the browser window. Netscape NavigatorÂª (versions 3.0 and earlier) display a broken key symbol in the lower left corner of your browser window when you are not viewing a secure page of a site. This key will become solid when you enter secure mode. Netscape Communicator 4.0 uses a padlock, in the same location as the key, to indicate if you are in standard or secure mode. The padlock is open in standard mode and closed in secure mode. In Microsoft's Internet Explorer™, you'll see a padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window when the browser is in secure mode.

Privacy

Your trust and satisfaction are our first priorities. We know your privacy is very important and that is why we take special care to safeguard the confidentiality and security of your information.

**How Do We Protect the Information You Provide?**

We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to safeguard all sensitive data transmitted to us. This means that your personal information \- including credit card number, name, expiration date, and billing information - is encrypted so that it cannot be read by anyone else.

We also offer an extra layer of security when you use a shared computer in a corporate or public area. Even if you select the auto-login feature on a machine that third parties might have access to, your password and your credit card information will NOT be displayed. Unlike other auto-login programs, our system will require that you type in your password every time, thus making sure it is really you who has signed in, and not someone else using the same computer.

Rugs Direct is a VeriSign Secure Site. The VeriSign seal at the bottom of any page allows you to confirm that we are who we say we are and that all the information you provide will be protected every time you use our service.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

When you visit our site, our server automatically collects non-personally identifiable information - your internet service provider address and information on the pages you access on our site. In addition, we store information you provide when you make a purchase or enter your e-mail address. We also collect information when you volunteer to complete a survey.

**How Do We Collect the Information?**

Like many Internet sites, we use "cookies" to recognize returning customers. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use the cookies to recognize your preferences and to keep track of items you've added to your shopping cart.
