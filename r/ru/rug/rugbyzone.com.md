# Privacy Policy | RugbyZone

_**This Privacy Policy was last updated on Feb 10th, 2009.**_

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how RugbyZone treats Personal Information that RugbyZone collects and receives, including Personal Information related to your use of the RugbyZone service. This policy applies to all Personal Information collected or submitted through the RugbyZone website, e-mail communications between you and RugbyZone or other means. 

The term 'Personal Information' means information about an individual that is personally identifiable and not publicly available, such as one's name, contact details, and credit card information, as well as the products and services in which one expresses an interest and/or which one purchases.

  
**Collection of Personal Information**

In order to create an account with RugbyZone and/or order and access certain services, products and areas provided by RugbyZone (collectively, the "Services"), you are required to provide certain Personal Information requested by the online registration feature, ordering feature and/or other pages or functions within the Services. This information may include your legal name, personal address, personal phone number, personal e-mail address, subscriber name or "screen name" and password used to access the Services. The Company reserves the right to request any additional information necessary to establish and maintain your account for use of any of the materials, goods or services available in connection with the Services. Once a username is created for you, RugbyZone stores such information in order to enable you to use the Services and to customize your experience.  
If you choose not to provide requested Personal Information, you will not be able to register with RugbyZone, subscribe to the Services, make any purchases or other transactions through the Service, or obtain other services or benefits that require such disclosure.

RugbyZone is the sole owner of all Personal Information provided to it, subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. In the event RugbyZone is acquired by, is merged into or is otherwise succeeded by another company, RugbyZone reserves the right to transfer its ownership of such Personal Information to such other company without notice to you. In the event of such a transfer, the privacy policy of the other company, to the extent it has one, may supplant this Privacy Policy.

  
**Use of Personal Information**

Except as set forth herein, RugbyZone will not provide any of your Personal Information to other companies or individuals without your permission, unless required by law or for other legal purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. RugbyZone will not rent, sell, or share your Personal Information to any unrelated third party except as described below. RugbyZone may use your Personal Information for the following purposes:

1\. To verify your user status, including without limitation by confirming that you are a RugbyZone subscriber, that you have paid for particular content that requires payment or that you satisfy other conditions concerning particular content (e.g., geographic or time restrictions);  
2\. To process your transactions, including without limitation for billing purposes and for delivery of the applicable Services to you;  
3\. To confirm your subscription to or cancellation from RugbyZone, or any particular purchases or licenses;  
4\. To customize the advertising and content you see based on your characteristics;  
5\. To improve our services;  
6\. To update and inform you about RugbyZone services and products, including the Services to which you have subscribed;  
7\. To provide you with targeted advertising, promotions and special offers from RugbyZone or our affiliates, advertisers, sponsors or other business partners;  
8\. To conduct research and surveys and aggregate data for the purpose of reporting trends (based on aggregated data that does not personally identify you) to RugbyZone and its business partners.  


Names, postal and e-mail addresses collected may be added to RugbyZone's databases and used for future communications and mailings regarding updates, new products and services of RugbyZone, upcoming events, and status of transactions you conduct online. If you desire not to receive the above information, you may contact us with such a request, in which case we will remove you from the requested lists. RugbyZone reserves the right to contact you regarding your account status and changes to the Terms and Conditions of Use, Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to the Services, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of, or opt in to, receiving them.

RugbyZone may provide your Personal Information to third party subcontractors for the purpose of processing payment, delivering goods or services to you or for other purposes related to your purchase or use of the Services. RugbyZone will provide those third parties only the information they need to perform the contemplated services.

  
**Opt Out**

As a subscriber or registrant to RugbyZone, you may be sent email correspondence providing you with an opportunity to opt out of receiving future communications based on your preferences. Except as permitted or required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy, RugbyZone will not send you offers or other communications if you have opted out of receiving them by clicking the appropriate box(es) during the registration or purchase processes or by opting out of receiving correspondence.

  
**Cookies**

Like other major websites, RugbyZone uses cookies to track traffic patterns on our website and to provide users with a customized experience when using our products and services. A cookie is a text file that our website transfers to your computer's hard drive for record-keeping purposes and to enhance the quality of your visit to our website. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.

Most Internet browsers are set up to automatically accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but doing so may limit system performance and may even cause certain features of the website to malfunction or not to work at all. You agree that RugbyZone shall not be liable to you for any such malfunction or limited system performance.

RugbyZone reserves the right to set and access RugbyZone cookies on your computer and to authorize the advertisers on the RugbyZone site to set and access their cookies on your computer. RugbyZone treats any Personal Information that may be contained in cookies with the same confidentiality as other Personal Information you provide to us. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this policy.

  
**Disclosures Required by Law and Investigations**

RugbyZone reserves the right to disclose your Personal Information in order to comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal process, or to establish or exercise RugbyZone's legal rights or defend against legal claims.  
RugbyZone reserves the right to use and disclose your Personal Information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, infringement of the intellectual property of RugbyZone or a third party, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person or violations of RugbyZone's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

  
**Security and Confidentiality of Personal Information**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy and ensure the correct use of Personal Information, RugbyZone has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures which RugbyZone regards as appropriate to safeguard and secure the Personal Information RugbyZone collects online.

RugbyZone uses encryption technology to protect the security of the information collected and transmitted through its website and Services. When RugbyZone's registration and order forms ask users to enter sensitive Personal Information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and transmitted to a secure database server using Secured Socket Layer encryption technology.

In addition, your RugbyZone Account Information is password-protected for your protection. After a successful login, you can change your password at your discretion. RugbyZone recommends that you choose a password that would be difficult to guess, that you change your password periodically and that you keep your password secret (including by not allowing friends or family members to use your account and password). You acknowledge that you are responsible for selecting a password and maintaining its secrecy. Under no circumstances will RugbyZone be liable to you or any third party for your failure to maintain the secrecy of your password.

  
**No Liability for Acts of Third Parties**

Although RugbyZone will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of the Personal Information you submit, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. RugbyZone will have no liability for disclosure of information and data you submit to it due to errors in transmission, unauthorized acts of third parties or through the use of third party cookies, programs, routines, viruses or other devices on your computer.

Once you leave the RugbyZone site, including by clicking on links on RugbyZone's website, you will be subject to the privacy policies of third party website operators and other companies which may differ significantly from this policy. RugbyZone encourages you to be aware of when you leave the RugbyZone site and to read the privacy policies of each website that collects information from or about you.

  
**Children**

RugbyZone does not currently accept any information submitted to or through the Services from children under the age of 13. No information should be submitted to RugbyZone or through the Services by children under 18 years of age without the consent of their parent or legal guardian. RugbyZone does not allow children under 13 to open an account or to receive direct marketing communications arising from their use of the Services and, therefore, RugbyZone does not provide any personally identifiable information from children under 13 to any third party.

  
**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

RugbyZone may update this policy from time to time. Any changes or updates will be effective immediately upon posting to RugbyZone's website, and your use of the website or any of the Services following such posting constitutes your acceptance of the Privacy Policy as so changed or updated. We reserve the right to notify you about changes in the way we treat Personal Information by sending a notice to one or more of the email addresses specified in your RugbyZone account or by placing a notice on the RugbyZone site in a manner and for a period of time that we determine in our sole discretion.
