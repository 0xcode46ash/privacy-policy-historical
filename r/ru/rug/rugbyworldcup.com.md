##### Privacy Policy 

Rugby World Cup Limited ("RWC") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following is a full description of our information gathering and dissemination practices for [www.rubgyworldcup.com](http://www.rubgyworldcup.com/). 

Collection of Information  
In general, you can visit the RWC site without providing personal information. However, there may be times when we will request personal information in order  that you may participate in our site's activities. Information is typically requested when you wish to enter contests, contact us, or subscribe to our newsletter or other subscription services. 

In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called ‘cookies’ on this site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. Our cookies enable us to work out what language to present the site in, to understand who has seen which pages and advertisements, to determine how frequently particular pages are visited and to determine most popular areas of our site. They also enable us to enhance your visitor experience by storing information about the products and services that you select between visits so that we can provide you with focused information each time you visit our site. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent cookies being stored, although if you do this the service that we are able to provide you may be limited.

When you submit personal information to RWC through our site, you agree that your information may be stored and processed by RWC. 

RWC reserves the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular web pages. RWC will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. RWC confirms that in general it will only use the information you provide within RWC. Where we want to pass the information on to someone else we will tell you - refer to the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information and to whom it will be made available. The option will then be yours to submit the information or not. 

How We Use the Information   
We collect and use your information in order to give you better service, to provide you with information on the Rugby World Cup and on Rugby Union and to make our site more useful to you. The contact information we collect is used to deliver the information you request from us. It is also used to contact you when necessary (e.g. competition winners). 

You have the right to prevent marketing information being sent direct to you. If you prefer not to receive information from us or from any other organisation to which we may disclose your personal information, ensure that you do not tick the “opt in” box which appears where you are given the option to subscribe to our newsletter. If you wish, at any time, to be removed from our newsletter list, please send an email with “unsubscribe” in the Subject line to [rwcnewsletter@rugbyworldcup.com](mailto:rwcnewsletter@rugbyworldcup.com). 

The organisations to which, with your permission, we will release your personal information are limited to our official sponsors (including Coca-Cola, Bundaberg Rum, BA/Qantas, Heineken, Suncorp, Peugeot, Telstra, Lloyds TSB and Visa), RealNetworks, RWC and/or its associated companies, the International Rugby Board, and/or the Member Unions thereof. RWC will only disclose your personal information without notice when it believes disclosure to be required by law or regulation, or necessary to protect or defend the rights or property of RWC, the safety of the public or the users of its site. 

  
Changes to this Privacy Policy  
We reserve the right to change our security and privacy policies at any time. Accordingly, we recommend that you check this page periodically in order to review our current policies.

Links to Other Sites   
RWC's site may contain links to other websites whose privacy and information practices may be different to ours. You should consult the other websites' privacy notices. RWC is not responsible for the content or privacy policies of other websites. 

Security   
We use physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard the information we collect from you online. We urge you to take precautions to protect your personal data when you are on the Internet. Keep any passwords safe and make sure you use a secure browser.  
Use of your information outside the European Union  
Some of the organisations to which we may disclose your personal information may be situated outside of the European Union. In order to provide you with the products and services you require, we may need to transfer your personal information to these countries some of which do not protect privacy rights as extensively as in the United Kingdom.

Your rights to access your personal information  
You have the right to receive a copy of the personal information that we hold about you. We may charge a small fee towards the cost of administering any request you make. The current fee is £10.00.

Correcting Information/ Contacting the Web Site   
If you wish to correct any information you have provided to us or if you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with the site, you can contact us by emailing us at [website@rugbyworldcup.com](mailto:website@rugbyworldcup.com) or writing to us at the address below.
