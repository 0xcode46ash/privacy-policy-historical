 **Collection of Information**

In general, you can visit the site without providing personal information. However, there may be times when we will request personal information in order that you may participate in the site's activities or features. Information is typically requested when you wish to enter contests, contact us, request particular information, or subscribe to our newsletter services and/or other services (for example, subscription services) available on the site. If you contact us, we may keep a record of that correspondence.

The personal information collected may include, but is not limited to, the following: name, e-mail address, address, age, country of residence, nationality, gender and/or chosen password to access certain parts of the site. In common with many other website operators, we may use standard technology called 'cookies' on the site. Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to tell us in what language the site should be presented to you, to improve the site and deliver a better and more personalised service. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser setting to prevent cookies being stored. However, if you adjust your browser setting in this way, you may be unable to access certain parts of the site.

Please note that third parties advertising on our site may also use cookies, over which we have no control.

When you submit personal information to RWC through the site, you agree that your information may be stored and processed by and/or on behalf of RWC. 

RWC may also collect information about your interaction with the site and the services on the site. This may include information about your computer and, where available, your IP address, operating system and browser type. In particular, RWC reserves the right to perform statistical analysis of user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to ascertain the number of users that have visited particular web pages. RWC will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties and this statistical data does not identify any individual. 

RWC confirms that in general it will only use the personal information you provide within RWC. Where we want to pass your personal information on to someone else, unless you have already and/or previously given us your permission to do so, we will tell you - refer to the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting your personal information and to whom it will be made available. The option will then be yours to submit your personal information or not.

 **How We Use the Information**

We collect and use your information in order to give you a better service and to provide you with information you request, including information about the Rugby World Cup tournament and/or the sport of Rugby Union.
