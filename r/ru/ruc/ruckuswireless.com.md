# Ruckus Wireless Privacy Policy | Ruckus Wireless, Inc.

Revised September 20, 2013

When you visit websites, you may be providing owners of those websites with information about yourself. At Ruckus, we want to help you understand how we use the information we collect from your visit to our websites. In general, we use the information we collect to improve those websites and our products and services, let you take advantage of programs and features presented on our websites and for our internal analysis.

## Information We Collect

When you visit our websites, our server logs capture non personal information such as your IP address, browser, and operating system. We may also capture additional information such as the paths taken as you move from page to page, video statistics, downloads, browser usage, actions you perform and devices used.

## Email

When you send us an email, we may use your email address to contact you regarding your comment or to reply to your question. We store your email and our reply in case we need to continue corresponding. When you request information, we use your email address and any other information you give us to provide you with the information related to your request. Recurring communications contain the ability to unsubscribe by using the “unsubscribe” instructions provided within each email. Certain onetime responses may not contain the “unsubscribe” instructions because of their onetime nature.

## Community Areas

When you post content or use forums, blogs, and our other community features, your name and profile information is available to others. If you post this information, we want you to be aware that other users of these areas or the general public may be able to capture, modify, transmit and generally use this information. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit to these areas.

## Personal Information

Ruckus only collects personal information that you choose to provide voluntarily. While you can browse our websites without providing personal information, you will need to input certain personal information as indicated on specific pages of our websites in order to take advantage of certain features, such as requesting updates, blogging, requesting assistance or participating in special programs.

“Personal information” includes information that can identify you, such as your name, address, phone number, email address, log-in information and credit/debit card information.

## Cookies

Like many sites, we use “cookies” to help us collect information related to usage data and improve our websites. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the website again, the cookie allows that website to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to block all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, but this may impact your ability to use some functionality on our websites. If you do not block cookies, you can delete them through standard browser functionality.

## Third Parties

We use a variety of third-party services, such as Google Analytics, Jobvite and Spiceworks, to help improve our websites, host our blogs/forums, process and store data, and to help us understand the use of our websites. These third-party service providers may collect information sent by your browser as part of a website request. We work closely with vendors and partners, many of which have links within the Ruckus website. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Ruckus website to another website, your interactions with those websites are governed by the privacy policy of the third-party, not this privacy policy.

## Transferring, Processing and Storing Personal Information

Ruckus is a global organization with offices in many countries and our headquarters in the United States. As a result, we may transfer your personal information to the United States, to any Ruckus subsidiary worldwide for the purposes of processing or storage. Your personal information may be transferred and stored outside of your country of residence where data protection standards may be different.

## Business transfers

If Ruckus is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your personal information, anonymous or aggregated information we collected from or about you, and any other information that we have collected on our websites may be transferred to an acquiring third party as part of our business assets. Also, if any bankruptcy or reorganization proceeding is brought by or against us, all such information may be considered one of our assets and may be sold or transferred to third parties.

## Legal Obligations to Disclose Personal Information

While we do not anticipate such requests, we may be required to share your personal information with third parties if required to do so by law.

## Security

Because the security of your personal information is important to us, we take reasonable steps to protect the information we collect. While we cannot guarantee absolute security of your personal information, we use firewalls and employ many different security techniques to protect against data loss, misuse, alteration and unauthorized access.

## Children

Our websites are not intended for children under the age of 13 and we do not knowingly collect personal information from those children.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

This privacy policy was posted September 20, 2013. We may change our privacy policy from time to time. We will post any changes on this page.
