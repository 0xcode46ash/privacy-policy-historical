This privacy statement covers the RSPCA's website at www.rspca.org.uk

The RSPCA website is the website of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, its charitable trading company - RSPCA Trading Ltd and its associated company - Freedom Food Ltd (registered charity no. 1059879). It also contains information on the RSPCA's branches, which are each separate registered charities. 

Where links are provided in this website to other websites, those other websites are not covered by this statement.

The RSPCA will take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is kept securely and to respect the information privacy of all visitors to its website. The RSPCA's website, and its agents, use up-to-date security technology features and procedures.

**Data collection**  
The RSPCA's website collects personal information from visitors to the site only with the permission of the individual. Where appropriate, information is provided to explain the reason for collecting this data and outlining any other uses which we would like to make of this data. We will provide an opportunity to opt out of any further uses of this information and an explanation of what these uses will be, where relevant.

The RSPCA's intention is that all data collection is open and obvious to the site visitor.

The padlock symbol is used to alert site visitors to the fact that their information is being collected and will be followed by an explanation of how their information is to be used. 

In order to receive a response via this website, or to express an interest in receiving information from us via this website, site visitors are asked to register with us online, by submitting data about themselves. Certain data is mandatory (eg name) and certain data is optional (eg telephone number).

**Children's data**  
We have special services which we offer to under 18s, so where appropriate we ask for your age. Data on minors is never disclosed to third parties and we do not send fundraising literature to under 18s. We recommend that under 13s obtain the permission of a parent or guardian before sending us their information by entering it on this website.

**Online donations**  
In order to make an online donation by credit card or direct debit, the site visitor will be directed to a sub-site operated by the RSPCA's agent, Valldata. As the sub-site is operated on behalf of and under contract to the RSPCA, this site is similar in appearance to the main RSPCA website. Where necessary further information about the collection of the data and any further uses to be made of the data will be provided on this sub-site. The site uses encryption and other security features.

**Data protection**  
The RSPCA has comprehensive data protection policies. You have a right to know about the personal data the RSPCA holds about you. You have a right to object to the receipt of direct marketing or campaign information sent to you by the RSPCA. Please address all enquiries about the RSPCA's data protection procedures to the information protection officer at the RSPCA's main address.

**Freedom of Information Act 2000**  
The RSPCA does not believe that it has any formal obligation under the Act. It is not a designated public authority. However, the Society fully supports the principle of openness and will endeavour to supply information to enquirers whenever possible.

As a charity relying entirely on voluntary donations, the Society will have to take into account the purpose of any request for information and the costs involved in providing it for the enquirer.
