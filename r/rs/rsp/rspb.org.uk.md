# Privacy - The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds

The RSPB is committed to protecting your privacy and security. Whenever you provide personal information, we will treat that information in accordance with this policy, current UK Data Protection legislation and Internet best practice.

 **Your choice  
** The use of this site does not require you to disclose personal information unless you choose to give it for a specific purpose, such as membership enrolment. At all points where personal information is required, a statement will appear explaining how this information will be used.

If you do not want your information to be used in any of the ways listed you may opt-out by ticking the box provided.

 **Information collected online  
** The RSPB membership application form and donations page invite you to give us contact information such as your name and address and financial information such as your credit/debit card number.

Names and addresses are also collected for other purposes such as recruitment, competitions and campaigning.

 **Financial security**  
RSPB forms which request credit card or bank details use the SSL(secure sockets layer) protocol for encryption. Most browsers (including current versions of Microsoft Explorer and Netscape Navigator) support SSL. The link between your browser and the server is secure if your browser displays a small padlock or key symbol somewhere in the frame, or the address bar shows a web address beginning 'https://' (rather than http://). 

 **Distance selling regulations**  
Consumers have the right to withdraw from a contract within 7 working days, starting the day after they receive the goods or services. If the contract is not fulfilled within 30 days (unless the parties have agreed otherwise) the consumer is entitled to a full refund.

Reimbursement will be made as soon as possible, in any case within 30 days of notice of cancellation.

This website only offers membership and donation facilities.  All other distance selling is done by third party websites on our behalf, with are covered by their own privacy policy. 

 **Data protection**  
When your name and address are requested, unless otherwise specified, the RSPB would like to hold details about you to send you further information about birds and nature conservation. The RSPB and RSPB Sales Ltd may share and review these details to help us understand more about you and to contact you about our fundraising and campaign work. We may also ask you to take part in confidential market research.

 **Children under 16**  
The RSPB will not collect online contact information from children under 16 years of age without prior parental consent or parental notification, which will include an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. Without prior parental consent, online information will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and will not be used for any other purpose. RSPB will not collect personally identifiable off-line contact information without prior parental consent.

The RSPB will not distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information without prior parental consent.

The RSPB will not publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information without prior parental consent.

The RSPB will not entice children by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in the activity.

Please note that the RSPB will not accept online donations or orders for goods or services from persons aged under 16 years. 

 **Cookies  
** A cookie is a very small text file that is placed on your hard drive by the server of a web page you visit. It is an individual label, which identifies you as a visitor - it cannot deliver viruses. Some of our cookies are generated automatically by the software we used to create parts of the site. Others are simply used to save time by automatically filling in any forms that you have already filled in. If you want to change any details you can simply type over any text. In the future, we may use cookie files to help personalise the site and help you experience it in the way that suits you best.

If you disable the use of cookies in your browser, we cannot guarantee that all parts of the site will work.

 **Links to third party websites**  
The RSPB website contains hyperlinks to many other websites. This information is supplied in good faith, in case it is of interest or use to RSPB website users. The RSPB is not responsible for the content or functionality of any of these external websites - but please let us know if a link is not working (use the 'Make a comment form', a link to which can be found at the bottom of every page on the RSPB website). Visitors to the RSPB website should be aware of the following:  

  * If an external website requests personal information from you (e.g. in connection with an order for goods or services), this information is supplied to, stored and used by the company concerned - it is not covered by the RSPB's Data Protection Statement. It is good practice to read the privacy policy of any website at which you are considering registering any personal information. 
  * In purchasing goods or services from any of the companies to which the RSPB site links, you are forming a contract with the company(s) concerned (agreeing to their terms and conditions), not the RSPB.
