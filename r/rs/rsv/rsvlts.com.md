# Privacy Policy | The Roosevelts

**Privacy  Policy**

The Roosevelts knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers The Roosevelts’s treatment of personal information that The Roosevelts gathers when you are on the The Roosevelts website and when you use The Roosevelts services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that The Roosevelts does not own or control, or to individuals that The Roosevelts does not employ or manage.

**Information Collected by The Roosevelts**

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our The Roosevelts users:

1\. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

2\. Automatic Information: 

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. The Roosevelts and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, The Roosevelts cookie information, and the page you requested. The Roosevelts uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.  
o The Roosevelts may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed. 

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While The Roosevelts will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

**E-mail Communications**

The Roosevelts is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. The Roosevelts may send out e-mails with The Roosevelts-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions.

**Cookies**

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. The Roosevelts cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of The Roosevelts’s coolest features. 

The Roosevelts’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads.  If you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our advertising partner Platform-A’s privacy policy and opt-out page.
