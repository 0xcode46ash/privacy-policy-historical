A few important things you should know about our use of Cookies:

  * We offer certain features that are available only through the use of Cookies
  * We use both session and persistent Cookies. Session Cookies expire and no longer have any effect when you log out of your account or close your browser. Persistent Cookies remain on your device until you erase them or they expire

**  
NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING**

We and our users do not tolerate spam. Make sure to set your RSVPify communication preferences so we communicate to you as you prefer. You are not licensed to add other RSVPify users, even a user who has purchased an item from you, to your mailing list (email or physical mail) without their express consent. To report RSVPify-related spam or spoof emails to RSVPify, please forward the email to support@RSVPify.zendesk.com or support@RSVPify.zendesk.com. You may not use our communication tools to send spam or otherwise send content that would violate our Terms of Service. We automatically scan and may manually filter messages to check for spam, viruses, phishing attacks and other malicious activity or illegal or prohibited content, but we do not permanently store messages sent through these tools. If you send an email to an email address that is not registered in our community (via Refer-a-Friend or other tools), we do not permanently store that email or use that email address for any marketing purpose. We do not rent or sell these email addresses.

**ACCESSING, REVIEWING AND CHANGING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

Your password is the key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not disclose your RSVPify password to anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify RSVPify and change your password.

You can see, review and change most of your personal information by signing on to RSVPify. Generally, we will not manually modify your personal information because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate.

If you disclose your information to others on our site or other sites throughout the internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you provide to them. RSVPify does not control the privacy policies of third parties, and you are subject to the privacy policies of those third parties where applicable. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
