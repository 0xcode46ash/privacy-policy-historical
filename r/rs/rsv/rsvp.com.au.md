We are a subsidiary of Fairfax Media Limited. This policy applies in addition to any privacy policy that otherwise applies in relation to websites in the Fairfax Digital network. To the extent of any inconsistency, this policy will take precedence.

### What information we collect and how we collect it

We collect personal information from a variety of sources, including from you, members of the public, advertisers, prospective employees, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners. 

In general, the personal information we collect includes (but is not limited to) name, email address, other contact details and possibly financial information, including credit card information. 

We store the personal information you enter on RSVP or give to RSVP in other ways. We obtain most personal information through the RSVP membership registration process and updates to membership details. You may also provide information to us when you request or acquire a product or service from us or our related companies, provide a product or service to us, complete a survey or questionnaire, enter a competition, participate in forums or when you communicate with us by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service to make a complaint or provide feedback). 

We obtain personal information that you provide as part of your RSVP member profile, such as age, gender, nationality, interests, marital status, and location. 

We also obtain personal information that you otherwise post or transmit on RSVP, and personal information provided to us via RSVP or otherwise by any other person. 

#### Automatic collection

We may use a feature of your browser called a cookie to assign your computer a 'User ID'. Cookies contain information by which we can identify your computer to our servers. You may configure your browser so that you are notified before a cookie is downloaded or so that your browser does not accept cookies. We may use information contained in cookies to make assumptions about the user of the computer and to provide users of that computer with focused advertising that we believe may be of interest, based on that information. In some cases a web page might contain more than one cookie, the information gathered from these different cookies are used to build statistical and demographical information which does not identify you personally to advertisers and other third parties for marketing, promotional purposes. 

To disable your cookies, please refer to the help menu within your Internet browser.

#### Indirect collection

We endeavour to collect personal information about an individual only from that individual. In some circumstances we may obtain personal information from a third party. If you provide personal information about another person to us, we require that you inform that person you have done so and provide them with a copy of this policy. 

### How we use the information we collect

We may use information we collect from you for the primary purpose for which it is collected and for such other secondary purposes that are related to the primary purpose of collection. We generally use personal information to: 

  * provide you with products or services you have requested (including to post your member profile on RSVP and transmit your messages to other members); 
  * personalise and customise your experiences on RSVP;
  * help us manage and enhance RSVP;
  * communicate with you (including transmitting messages from other members);
  * provide you with ongoing information about opportunities relating to RSVP that we believe you may be interested in;
  * give you the opportunity from time to time to receive e-mail and 'e-newsletters' from us;
  * investigate any complaints about or made by you; and/or
  * investigate you or your RSVP account if we have reason to suspect that you are or have been using RSVP in breach of the terms and conditions of use of RSVP or if we have reason to suspect that you are or have been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity. 



In most cases where we ask you to provide information about yourself, if you do not provide us with that information, we will not be able to provide you with the requested product or service. 

You agree that personal information that you provide and/or we obtain as part of your RSVP member profile, or that you otherwise post or transmit on any public area of RSVP, is non-confidential. You agree that we will be entitled to use such personal information for any purpose. 

### How we disclose the information we collect

We may disclose personal information to other companies in the Fairfax Group that may only use it as set out above. RSVP may also provide your information to third parties: 

  * engaged by RSVP to perform functions on its behalf, such as processing credit card information, mailouts, debt collection, marketing, research and advertising; 
  * authorised by you to receive information held by us (including other members);
  * as required or authorised by or under any law;
  * as a necessary part of any investigation by us into you or your RSVP account (including to your Internet Service Provider or network administrator); and/or 
  * if we have reason to suspect that you are or have been using RSVP in breach of the terms and conditions of use of RSVP or if we have reason to suspect that you are or have been otherwise engaged in any unlawful activity and we reasonably believe that disclosure is necessary, for example, for the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of any unlawful activity (including to the Police or any other enforcement body, or your Internet Service Provider or network administrator). 



You agree that personal information that you provide and/or we obtain as part of your RSVP member profile, or that you otherwise post or transmit on any public area of RSVP, is non-confidential. You agree that we may disclose such personal information to any third party for any purpose. 

You agree that we will be entitled to track your activity on RSVP, including by making a record of the member profiles that you view, and display such usage information to other members (provided that, in that case, we only ever disclose personal information that you provide and/or we obtain as part of your RSVP member profile, or that you otherwise post or transmit on any public area of RSVP). 

We may share web site usage information about visitors to RSVP who have received a targeted promotional e-mail campaign with DoubleClick International B.V. for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading visitor information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we, and our third-party advertising company, would keep information on the email campaign and some of the pages you visit on RSVP through the use of pixel tags (also called clear gifs). For more information about our advertising company, visit www.privacychoices.org. To opt out of this particular targeting program, please visit the Privacy Choices Optout page. 

### How we treat sensitive information

"Sensitive Information" means information relating to a person's racial or ethnic origin, membership of political bodies, religion, membership of a trade union or professional or trade association, sexual preferences, criminal record and health. 

We may use and disclose Sensitive Information only for the purpose for which it was provided or a directly related secondary purpose or as allowed by law unless you have agreed otherwise. 

### Management and security of your information

The Fairfax Group, of which we are a member, has appointed a Privacy Officer to oversee the management of personal information in accordance with this policy and the Commonwealth Privacy Act. 

We protect the personal information we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure by various means including firewalls, pass word access, secure servers and encryption of credit card transactions.
