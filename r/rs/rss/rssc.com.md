By knowing customer preferences, services and special offerings can be tailored to provide superior levels of convenience. Depending on the service you are accessing, you could be asked at various times to provide information such as your name, email address or information about what you like and do not like. Consistent with the Federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from children.

**What Information Do We Collect?**

We collect information in different ways. We collect the e-mail addresses of those visitors who volunteer them, and information such as survey information, postal address, telephone numbers and site registrations that you provide voluntarily.

If you collect Gold Points by using our brands, processing information will be sent to Gold Points, so that they can keep track of your transactions and properly credit your account.

We will not transfer information to competitors. Information about your preferences is only used to help us understand the products and services that might be attractive to you.

These offers may be based on information you provided us in your responses to our surveys and on your history with us as a customer.
