**_Definitions_**

Rsaconference.com is owned and operated by RSA, the Security Division of EMC, and contractors/agents of RSA, the Security Division of EMC. The terms "RSA", "we", "us", "our" and "ours" when used in this Privacy Policy means organizers of the RSA Conference and operators of the **RSAconference.com** website. This includes all its parents, subsidiaries, divisions, branches, affiliates or companies under common ownership or control of RSA. The terms "you", "your" and "yours" when used in this Privacy Policy means any user of this Web Site. The term "Personal Data" refers to personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, birth date, e-mail address or mailing address. This Privacy Policy describes RSA's current policies and practices with regard to Personal Data collected by RSA through [www.rsaconference.com](http://www.rsaconference.com/) ("Web Site"). We operate this Web Site in full compliance with relevant data protection legislation in operation in a number of European member states.

**_Notification of changes to this Policy_**

We are continually improving and adding new functionality and features to this Web Site and improving and adding to its existing products, services and programs. Because of these ongoing changes, changes in the law and the changing nature of technology, our data practices will change from time to time. If and when our data practices change, we will post the changes on this Web Site to notify you of the changes. We encourage you to check this page frequently.

**_Collection of Personal Data including e-mail addresses_**

We collect the information you give us when you use our Web Site. You may use this Web Site to register to receive additional information or products from us. When you register, we ask you for contact information like your name, postal address and e-mail address. This information enables us to provide you with more personalized service.

We sometimes supplement the information that you provide with information that is received from third parties. For instance, if inaccurate postal or zip codes are received, we will use third party software to fix them.

Unless you “opt-in” or otherwise give us express permission to do so, your personal contact information will not be provided to other, non-RSA third parties.

**_RSA Conference Email Marketing Communication Policy_**

This policy reflects the United States Direct Marketing Association's "Commercial Solicitation Online Guidelines".

RSA sends promotional email messages only under the following circumstances:

> 1\. They are sent to our own customers, or
> 
> 2\. Individuals have given their affirmative consent to RSA to receive solicitations online, or
> 
> 3\. Individuals did not opt out after RSA has given notice of the opportunity to opt out from solicitations online, or
> 
> 4\. Individuals have attended or registered to attend any RSA Conference,
> 
> 5\. Individuals who have “joined” the RSACONFERENCE.com community, or
> 
> 6\. RSA has received assurance from a third party list provider that the individualswhose e-mail addresses appear on that list:
> 
>   * Have already provided affirmative consent to receive solicitations online, or
>   * Have already received notice of the opportunity to have their e-mail addresses removed and have not opted out.
> 


In each solicitation sent online, RSA furnishes individuals with a link or notice they can use to request that the RSA not send them future solicitations online. These requests will be honored in a timely manner.

RSA will pass on your contact information to other companies or individuals if you specifically ‘opt-in” to being contacted. Once you have opted in to have your contact information passed to another company or inidivual, your contact details will become subject to their privacy policies and terms of conditions. Otherwise, RSA never rents or sells email addresses to any other company or individual.

RSA always discloses its identity in mass email communication, and provides specific company contact information.

**_RSA Conference Email Marketing Communication Policy_**

From time to time, RSA allows vendors of information security and related products to rent the physical mailing list from the RSA Conference. You may become part of a vendor's database (and subject to its privacy policies) if you respond to its mailing. Often, the vendors are companies who exhibit on the show floor. If your registration badge is read at their booth during the Conference, you may also become part of their database.

If you do not want to receive these mailings, please opt out when you register for the Conference. Or call the RSA marketing department at 1.650.295.7600 or [email your opt-out request](mailto:mveit@rsasecurity.com) and ask that your name be removed from the mailing list. Alternatively, you can fill out the [opt out request form](https://info.rsasecurity.com/common/rsac_opt_out.html "opt out request form").

**_Use of Personal Data_**

We process your Personal Data only for specific and limited purposes. We ask only for data that is adequate, relevant and not excessive for those purposes. When we ask you for Personal Data, we tell you the purposes for which we will process that data. Some of these purposes include the following:

  * We may contact you occasionally to inform you of new services we will be providing, or special offers, events or articles we think will be of interest to you.
  * We may send you regular updates by e-mail or by post on RSA Conference related events.
  * We may send you requested Conference information and promotional material.
  * We may use your Personal Data for marketing purposes and market research.
  * We may rent your name and physical address information (but never your e-mail address information) to vendors of information security and related products.
  * We may use your Personal Data to help us improve our Conference and services and to help resolve any problems.



**_  
Disclosure of your Personal Data_**

We do not share, sell or distribute your Personal Data with unrelated third parties, except under these limited circumstances:

  * We may rent your name and physical address information (but never your e-mail address information) to vendors of information security and related products.
  * Personal Data may occasionally be transferred to third parties who act for or on behalf of RSA, or in connection with the business of RSA for further processing in accordance with the purposes for which the data was originally collected or for purposes to which you have subsequently consented. For example, sometimes a third party may have access to your Personal Data in order to handle our mailings on our behalf.
  * We may share or transfer the information in our databases to comply with a legal requirement, for the administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, to protect the security or integrity of our databases or this Web Site, to take precautions against legal liability, or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganisation, dissolution or similar event.



Where appropriate, before disclosing Personal Data to a third party, we contractually require the third party to take adequate precautions to protect that data.

**_Data Integrity and Security_**

We strive to maintain the reliability, accuracy, completeness and currency of Personal Data in our databases and to protect the privacy and security of our databases. We keep your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.

Our servers and our databases are protected by industry standard security technology, such as industry standard firewalls and password protection.

Sometimes we process sensitive data that requires industry standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted browsers. We use 128-bit encryption to protect transmissions over the Internet.

The employees who have access to Personal Data have been trained to handle such data properly and in accordance with our security protocols and strict standards of confidentiality. Although we cannot guarantee against any loss, misuse, unauthorized disclosure, alteration or destruction of data, we try to prevent such unfortunate occurrences.

**_Data Access and Corrections_**

Upon receipt of your written request and enough information to permit us to identify your Personal Data, we will disclose to you the Personal Data we hold about you. We will also correct, amend or delete any Personal Data that is inaccurate and notify any third party recipients of the necessary changes.

If you wish to access or correct your Personal Data, please write to our data protection officer at RSA Inc., 174 Middlesex Turnpike, Bedford, MA 01730 or e-mail us at [webmaster@rsaconference.com](mailto:webmaster@rsaconference.com). We do not charge for complying with a correction request, however, for all other requests, we may charge a small fee to cover its costs. Requests to delete Personal Data are subject to any applicable legal and ethical reporting or document retention obligations imposed on RSA.

In addition to the information we collect as described above, we use technology to collect anonymous information about the use of our Web Site. For example, we use technology to track which pages of our Web Site our visitors view. We also use technology to determine which Web browsers our visitors use. This technology does not identify you personally, it simply enables us to compile statistics about our visitors and their use of our Web Site.

Our Web Site contains hyperlinks to other pages on our Web Site. We use technology to track how often these links are used and which pages on our Web Site our visitors choose to view.

**_Cookies_**

In order to collect the anonymous data described in the preceding paragraph, we may use temporary "cookies" that collect the first level domain name of the user (for example, if your e-mail address is "john@bigmail.com," the cookie collects the "bigmail.com" portion of your e-mail address) and the date and time you accessed this Web Site. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to discover the identity of the user. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies do not damage your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie. This enables you to decide if you want to accept it or not. At the present time, we only use temporary or "session" cookies. These cookies expire when your browser is closed.

We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web Site. An IP address is a numeric code that identifies your computer on a network, or in this case, the Internet. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information, such as determining how many of our visitors are from outside of the US.

We may also perform IP lookups to determine which domain you are coming from (i.e: aol.com, yourcompany.com) to more accurately gauge our users' demographics.

We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children or minors. If you are a child or minor, please do not give us any Personal Data.
