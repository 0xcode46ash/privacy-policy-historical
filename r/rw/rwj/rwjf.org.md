# Privacy Policy - Robert Wood Johnson Foundation

### Effective Date: March 9, 2016

This Privacy Policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) applies to (1) the website located at [_www.rwjf.org_](http://www.rwjf.org/) (the “ **website** ”), which is owned and operated by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (the “ **Foundation** ,” “ **we** ,” “ **us** ,” or “ **our** ”), and (2) any other websites, blogs, online communities, social media platforms, or other services that we may provide from time to time, whether on the website or otherwise (collectively, “ **Services** ”) and that link to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes how the Foundation collects and uses personally identifiable information you provide on the Sites. Your use of the Services also is subject to any additional privacy policy that may be specified with respect to the Service at issue. As used in this Privacy Policy, the term “Sites” refers to the website and the Services. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personally identifiable information and how you can access and update this information.

If you have questions or complaints regarding our Privacy Policy or practices, please contact us at:

**Information Collection**

Unless otherwise disclosed, the Foundation is the sole owner of information collected on the Sites. The Foundation may collect information from our users at several different points on the Sites. For example, we may collect information you provide to us when you use the Sites or otherwise transact business with us, such as when you complete a form on the Sites, when you register for an account with us, and/or when you contact us to inquire about our products or services. More information is provided below.

**_Registration_**

In order to use some features of the Sites, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user may be required to provide personally identifiable information and contact information (such as name, email and postal address).

**_Grant Applicants_**

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the information collected through the grant application or review process.

**_Publication Orders_**

When a user orders a publication from the Sites, contact/shipping information (such as name, email, and shipping address) must be provided.   

**_Interests_**

Unless otherwise stated, it is optional to provide information about your interests to better facilitate your interaction with the Sites.

**_Surveys_**

We may request information from users via surveys or contests. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as ZIP code). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and users may therefore choose whether or not to disclose this information.

**_Tell-A-Friend_**

If a user elects to use a referral service for informing a friend about our Sites, we ask them for the friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the website and/or other Sites. We do not store this information except as needed to process the requested referral function.

**_Cookies and Other Technologies_**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use cookies or other technologies (such as web beacons and pixel tags) to track site usage and trends, to improve the quality of our service, and to customize your experience on the website. We may provide this statistical information to third parties. We may use session-based cookies for session navigation purposes. By setting a cookie on our website, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. We also use persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can turn off the ability to receive cookies by adjusting the browser on your computer. If you refuse cookies, however, you may not be able to access or use some of the features we offer on our website. Electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) may be used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

**_Log Files_**

Like most standard website servers, we use log files, through which we may record Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Sites, track users’ movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Such log file information is not linked to personally identifiable information.

**_Third Party Cookies_**

The use of cookies by our tracking utility companies is not covered by this Privacy Policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies. Our tracking utility companies use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, and to compile aggregated statistics to help us analyze how our Sites are used.

**_Behavioral Targeting/ Re-Targeting_**

We partner with a third-party ad network to either display advertising on our Sites or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not want this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

**_Social Media Widgets_**

Our Sites often include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook “Like” button and Widgets, such as the “Share” this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our Sites. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Sites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Information Use**

The Foundation may use personally identifiable information collected from you for several general purposes:

●    to deliver the products (i.e., publications) and services that you have requested and respond to your inquiries;

●    to provide information about our products and services;

●    to manage your profile account and provide you with customer support;

●    to conduct surveys relating to the development of our services and Sites;

●    to otherwise maintain and administer the Sites; and

●    for other purposes described to you at the time you provide information to us.

The examples below explain further how we may use information collected through the Sites.

**_Profile_**

We store information that we collect through log files, interest boxes, and/or third parties to create user profiles. User profile information is tied to the users’ personally identifiable information to provide services and improve the content of the website for the user. User profiles are used to tailor a user’s visit to our website and to direct pertinent communications to them.

We may share your user profile with others, such as RWJF national program offices, grantees, co-funders and consultants. We would do so because the Foundation aims to ensure that diverse points of view are represented in our work. We believe diverse perspectives and experiences can deepen our understanding of differences in health outcomes and health care delivery. Varied perspectives also can strengthen our capacity to develop effective solutions.

**_Communications_**

For new email subscribers, we use Double Opt-In which is also referred to as Confirmed Opt-In. We send all new registrants an email with a link to confirm their email subscription. Unless otherwise stated, new registrants will be signed up to receive Advances®, the Foundation’s monthly newsletter. Established registered users will occasionally receive information they have asked to receive such as information about products, services and/or alerts.  

Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option not to receive newsletter communications. Please see the Choice/Opt-out section below.

**_Service Announcements_**  


From time to time, it may be necessary for us to send out a service-related announcement. For instance, if our website is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. These communications are not promotional in nature.

**Information Sharing**

_**Personally Identifiable Information**_

We may disclose your personally identifiable information to other companies or people as stated in this Privacy Policy, including under any of the following circumstances:

●    when we have your consent to share the information. You may grant such consent at the time you provide or transmit information to us;

●    to conform or comply with the law, or if we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a court order or subpoena, to cooperate with investigations by law enforcement or regulatory authorities or to participate or cooperate with a judicial proceeding, to enforce applicable terms and conditions of the website, or in urgent circumstances, to protect the safety of persons or property, including the website; or

●    in the event of a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving the Foundation or other similar transaction, your personal information will, in most instances, be transferred to the control of a third party. In addition, we may use third-party service providers (“ **Service Providers** ”) to provide certain services, such as hosting, software maintenance, or database maintenance, which are necessary for Foundation operations, including the operation of the website. These Service Providers may be supplied with or have access to the information you provide through the website, but only for the purpose of providing services to the Foundation or on our behalf. Third parties are prohibited by the Foundation from using your information for any secondary purposes.

**_Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)_**

We may share and disclose information in aggregate, without linking such information to any personally identifiable information.

**Choice/Opt-out**

In general, our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our Sites at the point where we ask for information. In addition, users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or secondary communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by visiting the Subscribe to Email link in the footer of every page.

**Blogs**

Our Site may offer publicly accessible blogs or community forums. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personally identifiable information from our blog or community forum, [contact us](http://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/contact-rwjf.html). In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personally identifiable information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

**Links**

The Sites may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our Sites and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected on the Sites.

**Security**

We have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Updating and Deleting Personally Identifiable Information**

We do not collect personally identifiable information for email subscribers.

**Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or request that we no longer use your information to provide you services, please [contact us](http://www.rwjf.org/en/about-rwjf/contact-rwjf.html). We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Your California Privacy Rights**

Pursuant to California Civil Code Section 1798.83, a California resident who has provided personal information to a business with whom he/she has established a business relationship has the right to request certain information regarding the disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.
