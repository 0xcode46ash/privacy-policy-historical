## Information Collection and Use 

  


### Information Collection  


The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is the sole owner of the information collected on rwjf.org websites. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

### Registration 

In order to use some parts of the Web site, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user may give contact information (such as name, email and postal address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he or she has expressed interest. For example, we respond to inquiries about grantee resources, funding opportunities, and Foundation publications.

### Grant Applicants 

This privacy statement does not apply to the information collected through the grant application process. ([http://grantmaking.rwjf.org](http://grantmaking.rwjf.org/))

### Order 

If only requesting publications from the site we request the same basic information from the user on our order form. A user must provide contact/shipping information (such as name, email, and shipping address). This information is used to fill customer's orders. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user.

### Interests 

It is optional to provide information about your interests to better facilitate your interaction with the website.

## Information Use 

Generally, we use information for the purpose of which it was originally collected. For instance, we use information for fulfilling orders for documents and publications, responding to requests for information, career inquiries, and fulfilling the services of The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.

### Profile 

We store information that we collect through log files, interest boxes, and/or third parties to create a profile of some of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users. Consequently, this collected information is tied to the users' personally identifiable information to provide services and improve the content of the site for the user. This profile is used to tailor a user's visit to our Web site and to direct pertinent communications to them. We do not share your profile with any third parties.

### Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's computer tied to information about the user. Usage of a cookie is not linked to personally identifiable information while on our site.

We use session based cookies for session navigation purposes. By setting a cookie on our site, users would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be timed out prematurely.

### Log Files

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information.

### Communications from the Site  


**Special Offers and Updates  
**We send all new registrants a welcoming email to verify password and username. Established registered users will occasionally receive information they have asked to receive like products, services and/or alerts. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out section below.

**Newsletter  
**If a user wishes to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and email address. Out of respect for our users privacy we provide a way to opt-out of these communications. Please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Service Announcements  
**On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

### Sharing   


We DO NOT Share Personal Information with Third Parties, except as needed to fulfill requested services using intermediaries or agents, without users express consent.

Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may disclose personal information when we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with an appropriate law enforcement investigation, current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site.

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**   
We may share aggregated demographic information. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information.

**Third Party Intermediaries**   
We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders or other third parties that handle your personal information acting solely on our behalf. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Business Transitions**   
In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another entity, or divest a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via email or prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

### Choice/Opt-out  


Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for information. For example, our order/registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users who order a product from us, but don't want any secondary material, can keep their email address off of our lists. 

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter or secondary communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by visiting our registration page and choosing not to receive information. 

### Links  


This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site. Users of our site are always notified when their information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so our users can make an informed choice as to whether or not they should proceed with services that require an outside party.

## Surveys   


We may request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site or our services. Users' personally identifiable information is not shared with third parties unless we give prior notice and choice. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys or contests, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

### Tell-A-Friend   


If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend's name and email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit the site. We do not store this information except as needed to process the requested referral function.

## Security   


This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. The servers that store personally identifiable information is in a secure environment.

## Supplementation of Information   


In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to users it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd party sources. For example, to determine if users qualify for one of our grants we use their information to compare and determine their identity.

## Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information   


If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, you can [update your profile](https://web.archive.org/services/myprofile.jsp). 

## Notification of Changes   


If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via email and/or by posting a notice on our Web site for 30 days.
