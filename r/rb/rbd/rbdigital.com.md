Privacy Statement for Recorded Books, Inc.
Your privacy is of great importance to Recorded Books, Inc. (“We”).
As a user of this web site (the “Site”), Recorded Books, Inc. values
you and We will take appropriate measures to protect the
personally identifiable information provided by and collected from
you on the Site in connection with the functions, facilities,
products, and services offered on the Site.
What Information Does Recorded Books, Inc. Collect?
We gather information so that we can improve and personalize
your experience with RBdigital Gateway. Information that We
collect falls into the following primary categories.
Information that Customers Give Us:
We receive and store the information that you enter at the Site or
give to us in any other way off line. For example, We collect the
information that you provide when you fill out the information in
any “contact us” form on the Site or when you create an account.
You can always choose not to provide some or all of the
information We ask for, but this may prevent you from receiving
information or obtaining certain services that you desire.
Automatic Information:
Whenever you interact with the Site, We receive and store certain
types of information. For example, We use "cookies" to obtain


information when your web browser accesses this Site. A cookie is
an alphanumeric identifier which We transfer to your computer via
your web browser and store on your computer's hard drive. The
cookie file allows us to recognize your computer when you visit
the Site. On most web browsers you will find a "help" section on
the toolbar. Please refer to this section for information on how to
receive notification when you are receiving a new cookie, and how
to turn cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned
on because they will enable you to take advantage of some of the
Site’s best features.
Log Files:
The Site uses log files to record the IP addresses that users come
from, what browsers they use, what pages they most frequently
and least frequently visit, and other similar types of information for
systems administration purposes. We do not link cookies or IP
addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a
user's session is tracked, but the user remains anonymous.
How Does Recorded Books, Inc. Use the Information It
Receives?
Recorded Books, Inc. uses the information that users provide to
the Site in a manner that is consistent with the reason for which
the information was provided. For instance, if a user contacts
Recorded Books, Inc. with a question, Recorded Books, Inc. will use
the contact information of that user in order to respond to that


question. Additionally, Recorded Books, Inc. uses automatic
information for systems administration to improve our Site and for
troubleshooting purposes.
Does Recorded Books, Inc. Share the Information It Receives?
Recorded Books, Inc. considers the information provided by our
users to be a vital part of our relationship with our users and We
treat it with great care and respect. There are, however, certain
circumstances in which We may share such personal data with
certain third parties, as set forth below.
Agents:
Recorded Books, Inc., like many companies that serve consumers,
hires other companies to perform certain functions. Examples
include managing our database and mailing requested
information. When We employ another company to perform a
function of this nature, We only provide them with the information
they need to complete the task and they are not allowed to use
that information for any other purpose.
Business Transfers:
As We develop our business, We might sell or buy businesses,
stores, or assets. In transactions such as these, customer
information is generally one of the transferred business assets.
Moreover, in the unlikely event that Recorded Books, Inc. or one of
its business lines is acquired, customer information may be one of


the transferred assets.
Protection of Recorded Books, Inc. and Others:
Except for the limited rights granted in Section II.1(a) of the Terms
of Use agreement, Recorded Books, Inc. and/or its licensors own
and/or control all right, title and interest (including, without
limitation, all copyrights) in and to the Site, Site Content, and

hyperlinks, interlinks, search engines, images, software, illustrations,
photos, animation, video, audio, audiovisual works, designs or

acknowledge that you shall not acquire any ownership rights by
accessing or using the Site, Site Content, or Service. You
acknowledge and agree that modification of the Site Content, or
use of the Site Content for any other purpose, is a violation of
Recorded Books, Inc.’s, and possibly other third parties’, copyright
and proprietary rights.

companies?
