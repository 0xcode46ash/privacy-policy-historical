# RBA: Privacy Statement

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is committed to respecting the privacy of visitors to its website. This statement sets out the Bank's current practices concerning information collection and dissemination through this website.

### What information do we collect when you visit our site?

When you connect to our website, our service provider (ISP) makes a record of your connection but we do not collect any information that identifies you personally or gives details on your use of the site. In particular, the RBA does not use "cookies" to get information on you or your use of our site. (A "cookie" is a file that could be placed on your hard drive by a website without your knowledge to allow it to monitor how the site is used). We would inform you before any "cookies" were used by posting any changes to this policy on this page.

Information from ISP logs will only be disclosed if the RBA is required by law to do so.

### What happens if you send us an e-mail?

We will record your e-mail address or other personal details only if you send us a message, purchase a publication or subscription, or apply for registration as a public user of the Bank's archives. Please note that any mail - electronic or paper - might become part of the records of the RBA.

If you are submitting personal or other information over the internet please note that, while all attempts are made to ensure security of information transmitted to this site, there is a possibility that information you send could be seen by a third party while it is in transit.

Your personal details will be used only for the purpose for which you have provided them. They will not be added to a mailing list unless you authorise us to do so and we will not disclose them without your consent. Information that you may provide is used by the RBA to respond to your needs and enquiries and to help us improve the website.

### What about links to other sites?

This website contains many links to other sites as an additional tool to help us meet your needs. The RBA, however, is not responsible for the privacy policies or the content of these sites. Our [Disclaimer](https://web.archive.org/Disclaimer/index.html) provides further information.

### How can you contact us about privacy matters or the website generally?

If you have any queries about the RBA's privacy policy and practices or other matters you can contact us on [rbainfo@rba.gov.au](mailto:rbainfo@rba.gov.au) or write to:
