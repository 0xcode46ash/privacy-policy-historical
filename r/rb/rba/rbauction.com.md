**Sharing**

We may share aggregated demographic information with our partners and affiliates. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

If we partner with another party to provide specific services, and a user registers for these services, we will share names, or other contact information necessary for the third party to provide the requested services.

Currently there are no such services available on our website and RBA is not party to any such information sharing agreements.

**Links**

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that RBA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

**Security**

Our website takes several precautions to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via our website, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When users are asked to enter sensitive information (such as bidding and consigning information), that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard encryption software. While on a secure page, ie. our rbauctionBid - Proxy 'Confirmation \- Terms of Bidding and Sale' page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about the encryption software in use on our website, follow this [link](http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/www-security-faq.html).

While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are required to strictly observe our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers and backup tapes on which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.

**Special Offers, and Site and Service Updates**

We may send registrants site and service announcement updates, and information regarding new or improved services and upcoming events that we think may be of interest to them. Registrants are not able to un-subscribe from these announcements. We may communicate with a user to provide requested services or with respect to their account via email or phone.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

A registrant may change or update its personally identifiable information or remove itself from our service, by emailing us at [ info@rbauction.com](mailto:info@rbauction.com?).

**Choice / Opt-Out**

When registering for access to the Member Services section of the website, users can de-select the checkbox that asks if they would like periodic email marketing notices (rbauctionUpdates), however, as mentioned in the Special Offers, and Site and Service Updates section, some messages are not optional for web site registrants.

By using the RBA website and services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement.

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Your continued use of any portion of the RBA website following notification or posting of such changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes.

If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to our Privacy Statement web page and update the date listed on the links to it, as well as on the statement itself. We will post those changes so users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that currently stated, we will notify users by email.
