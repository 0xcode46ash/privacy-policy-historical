**Information Collection**

Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, RBA will inform individuals of the purposes for the collection, use, or disclosure of the individual's personal information prior to collecting, using or disclosing the personal information. 

RBA collects personal information from individuals through various means, including through RBA's web sites and through bidder registration cards submitted to RBA by individuals. For security reasons, RBA may also utilize video or other surveillance means to monitor its premises from time to time. 

Requirements for consent to collection, use, or disclosure of personal information vary depending on circumstances and on the type of personal information that is intended to be collected, used, or disclosed. In determining whether consent is required and, if so, which form of consent is appropriate, RBA will take into account both the sensitivity of the personal information at issue and the purposes for which RBA will use the information. Consent may be express, implied (including through use of “opt-out” consent where appropriate), or deemed. For example, if an individual provides his/her mailing address and requests information regarding a particular product, consent to use the address to mail product information to the individual is implied. 

On giving reasonable written notice to RBA, an individual may withdraw consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of his or her personal information. Upon receipt of this withdrawal, RBA will notify the individual of the likely consequences of withdrawing his or her consent. Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, RBA will then stop collecting, using or disclosing the individual's personal information.

**Information Use**

RBA uses information collected from individuals to provide products or services, to respond to requests for information regarding RBA's products and services, and for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. The information gathered will be used for general corporate marketing purposes, thereby enabling RBA to refine and improve our service and better meet our customers' needs. 

RBA will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted by law. Once the information is no longer required to fulfill its intended purposes, and is no longer required or permitted to be retained for legal or business purposes, it will be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous.

If we partner with another party to provide specific services, and a user registers for these services, we will share the contact information or other information necessary for the third party to provide the requested services. 

RBA may also disclose personal information to legal, financial, and other professional advisors and to its lenders or insurers in connection with the operation of its business, or in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of its business or operations.

#### Management of Personal Information:

  
**Security**

We take several precautions to protect our users' personal information. When users submit sensitive information, their information is protected both online and off-line. 

When users are asked to enter sensitive information (such as bidding and consigning information) on our website, that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard encryption software. While on a secure page, for example, our rbauctionBid - Proxy 'Confirmation - Terms of Bidding and Sale' page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about the encryption software in use on our website, follow this [link ](http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/www-security-faq.html). 

While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are required to strictly observe our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers and backup tapes on which we store personal information are kept in a secure environment.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

By using the RBA website and services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement. 

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Your continued use of any portion of the RBA website following notification or posting of such changes, will constitute your acceptance of those changes. 

If we change our privacy practices, we will post those changes to our Privacy Statement web page and update the date listed on the links to it, as well as on the statement itself. We will post those changes so users are always aware of what personal information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We may from time to time provide notice of changes to this Privacy Statement by email or mail, or to other contact information provided by you. 

We use personal information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the personal information was collected. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that currently stated, we will notify users.
