# Privacy Statement | Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers

**Information Collection**

Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, RBA will inform individuals of the purposes for the collection, use, or disclosure of the individual's personal information prior to collecting, using or disclosing the personal information.   
RBA collects personal information from individuals through various means, including through RBA's web sites and through bidder registration cards submitted to RBA by individuals. For security reasons, RBA may also utilize video or other surveillance means to monitor its premises from time to time.   
Requirements for consent to collection, use, or disclosure of personal information vary depending on circumstances and on the type of personal information that is intended to be collected, used, or disclosed. In determining whether consent is required and, if so, which form of consent is appropriate, RBA will take into account both the sensitivity of the personal information at issue and the purposes for which RBA will use the information. Consent may be express, implied (including through use of “opt-out” consent where appropriate), or deemed. For example, if an individual provides his/her mailing address and requests information regarding a particular product, consent to use the address to mail product information to the individual is implied.   
On giving reasonable written notice to RBA, an individual may withdraw consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of his or her personal information. Upon receipt of this withdrawal, RBA will notify the individual of the likely consequences of withdrawing his or her consent. Except where otherwise required or permitted by law, RBA will then stop collecting, using or disclosing the individual's personal information.

**Information Use**

RBA uses information collected from individuals to provide products or services, to respond to requests for information regarding RBA's products and services, and for additional purposes that may be identified at or before the time that the information is collected. The information gathered will be used for general corporate marketing purposes, thereby enabling RBA to refine and improve our service and better meet our customers' needs.   
RBA will not use or disclose personal information for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except with the consent of the individual or as required or permitted by law. Once the information is no longer required to fulfill its intended purposes, and is no longer required or permitted to be retained for legal or business purposes, it will be destroyed, erased, or made anonymous.

**Information Disclosure**

We are the sole owner of the information collected on this site and will not share or rent this information to others in any way other than as disclosed in this Privacy Statement.   
RBA may disclose certain personal information to third party service providers and to affiliated entities in order to carry out work on behalf of RBA. RBA will take appropriate steps to ensure that such recipients safeguard the personal information and use the information only for authorized purposes. If we partner with another party to provide specific services, and a user registers for these services, we will share the contact information or other information necessary for the third party to provide the requested services.   
RBA may also disclose personal information to legal, financial, and other professional advisors and to its lenders or insurers in connection with the operation of its business, or in connection with the sale or reorganization of all or part of its business or operations. In respect of RBA's fraud detection and prevention efforts or the investigation of unlawful activities, RBA may collect and disclose personal information in cooperation with law enforcement authorities.   
By using the RBA web site, you agree to allow RBA to use your remarks, suggestions, writings or comments as RBA so determines without your further consent and without compensation or any other interests or rights. However, RBA will not identify the specific source of the comments by name or email address without your permission. You also agree that RBA will not be liable for use or acquisition of your information by any third party without RBA's knowledge or consent.

Registration for access to certain areas of the web site, including auction results and fleet valuator, requires registrants to submit personal information including that required for email notification subscription (above), plus company name, mailing address, and telephone number.   
Registration for access to online bidding services requires registrants to submit personal information including that required for the above purposes, plus physical address, personal identification (driver's license or passport ID), and tax information.

Information including unique ID, access time, equipment search parameters and visitor feedback is collected. The online bidding and online consignment features collect access details including the RBA Express Bidder number and bid and consignment details.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data containing information about a user and is stored on the user's hard drive. Use of a cookie is in some ways linked to personal information while on our site - see details above. The cookies have long term expirations to provide convenience to users so that a user has to log in a password only once while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they will be able to use our site, but will be unable to access some areas. Cookies also enable us to track the interests of our users, allowing us to personalize and enhance their experience on our web site.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.

**Web Server Traffic Log Files**

Web server logs collect visitor information including IP address, browser type and version, referring URLs, referring search engines and specified search strings. This information helps us design improvements to the services and navigational structure of our web site.

**Children**

RBA does not attempt to collect personal information from children.   
Note that RBA cannot always determine if a user of our web site is a child.

**Links**

This web site contains links to other sites, including sites maintained by our corporate partners for the provision of online payment services and online shipping quotes. Please be aware that RBA is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to read the privacy statements of all web sites that collect personal information.

**Paper Brochures**

If a user wishes to subscribe to our brochure mailing list, we ask for contact information such as name and postal address.

**Surveys**

Occasional surveys may be conducted on the RBA web site. Survey information will be used to help us monitor and improve the use of this site and our services.

#### Management of Personal Information:

**Security**

We take several precautions to protect our users' personal information. When users submit sensitive information, their information is protected both online and off-line.   
When users are asked to enter sensitive information (such as bidding and consigning information) on our web site, that information is encrypted and is protected with industry-standard encryption software. While on a secure page, for example, our –online bidding –‘Terms of Bidding and Sale' page, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. To learn more about the encryption software in use on our web site, follow this [link](http://www.w3.org/Security/Faq/www-security-faq.html).   
While we use encryption software to protect sensitive information online, we also protect user-information off-line. Access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted within our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are required to strictly observe our security and privacy practices. Finally, the servers and backup tapes on which we store personal information are kept in a secure environment.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information**

A registrant may change or update its personal information or remove itself from our service, by emailing us at [csg@rbauction.com](mailto:csg@rbauction.com).

**Choice / Opt-Out**

When registering for access to the My Account section of the web site, users can de-select the checkbox that asks if they would like periodic email marketing notices (e.g. email newsletter and e-brochures). However, as mentioned in the Special Offers, and Site and Service Updates section, some messages are not optional for web site registrants.   
To ensure that you do not receive optional email notifications, please send an email to [events@rbauction.com](mailto:events@rbauction.com) with the word 'Unsubscribe' in the subject line.

**Notification of Changes& Acceptance of Privacy Statement**

By using the RBA web site and services, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Statement.   
We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time. Your continued use of any portion of the RBA web site following notification or posting of such changes will constitute your acceptance of those changes.

If we change our privacy practices, we will post those changes to our Privacy Statement web page and update the date listed on the links to it, as well as on the statement itself. We will post those changes so users are always aware of what personal information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We may from time to time provide notice of changes to this Privacy Statement by email or mail, or to other contact information provided by you.   
We use personal information in accordance with the Privacy Statement under which the personal information was collected. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner different from that currently stated, we will notify users. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their personal information in this different manner.
