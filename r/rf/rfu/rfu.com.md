The RFU offers certain functions and services which, if you choose to use them, will require information from you in order to work, such as your name, email, address and mobile telephone number. The RFU will endeavour to let you know before your personal information is collected from you on the Internet.

**Use of Personal Information**

Primary Purposes

We use personal information for five primary purposes: 

• To perform the services you have requested (such as administering your subscription to a free online service or processing orders from the Rugby Store).  
• To make the site easier for you to use by not making you enter your personal information more than once.   
• To help you  find what your looking for quickly.   
• To help us create and deliver content most relevant to you.   
• To alert you to new services, special offers, and other info.

  
**Processing Your Data**

If you choose to give us personal information to process an order or provide you with a subscription to a free service then this will be held and processed by the RFU in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.  The RFU may also need to transfer your personal information to its agents or sub-contractors who will process it on the RFU's behalf. 

 Due to the global nature of the internet, we may transfer your information to agents and subcontractors which are based in countries outside the UK.  Those countries may not have the laws which protect your personal information to the same level as in the UK, but the RFU will obtain security undertakings from them. 

**Providing you with information**

The RFU may use your personal information to supply you with information about the RFU and/or its related organisations, and new services offered to the game, as well as their respective activities and ranges of goods, services and opportunities (and otherwise where you have given your consent).

The RFU may use your personal information for general statistical purposes.  We also keep track of the domains from which users visit us. We analyse this data:

• for trends and statistics and to evaluate the efficiency of our web site and our internet infrastructure.

• to ensure that services offered (such as but limited to chat and forums) are not abused.

  
We may also use your information for detection of fraud and market research purposes.
