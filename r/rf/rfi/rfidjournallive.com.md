# RFID JOURNAL LIVE!

  
**Revised Nov. 27, 2003  
**  
RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of all information provided by users of our Web sites. We created this policy with a fundamental respect for our users' right to privacy and to guide our relationships with our users. This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for all our products and services, including but not limited to event-related Web sites. 

**Information Collection And Use  
**RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University collect information from our Web site users and customers. In this section of our privacy policy, we will describe the type of information we collect and how we use it to provide better services to our customers.

**Web Site Usage  
**You may visit the RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University Web sites without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. As you use the site, the site collects a log file, the IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data that we use to evaluate site traffic and usage patterns. This information is aggregated with tracking data from all site visitors and is used both to enable us to tailor content to the interests of visitors and to inform advertisers of the usage patterns and interests of our visitors.

**Registering  
**Before attending our events, users must first register. During registration, users are required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, mailing address and phone number). We also collect demographic information (such as job title and purchasing responsibilities, and company information). For internal purposes, we use this information to communicate with users and provide requested services. We may in certain instances share certain non-financial personal information in accordance with the policy described below under “With Whom Your Information is Shared.” We use aggregate demographic information about our audience to improve our service, for marketing purposes and/or industry reporting purposes. The aggregated information does not include any personally identifiable data. We also collect information in order to process payment for event registration. This financial information is stored for a limited period of time and is not shared with anyone other than the credit card processor. 

**Surveys**  
From time to time we invite users to provide information via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether to disclose requested contact information (such as name and mailing address) and demographic information (such as zip code or job title). We do not treat the information we collect through such surveys differently from any other comparable information that we receive through other means. Please refer to the other sections of this policy for discussions of specific types of information.

**Communications with Us  
**Our Web site contains certain features through which users can submit information to us. Requests for service, support or information may be forwarded as needed to best respond to a specific request. We may retain e-mails and other information sent to us for our internal administrative purposes, and to help us to serve customers better. We may in certain instances share certain non-financial personal information in accordance with the policy described below under “With Whom Your Information is Shared.” We do not share the actual correspondence.

**Communications from Us  
**In order to best serve our customers, we may send updates that contain important information about our sites, events and services. For example, we may communicate with a user to provide requested services, to communicate about an upcoming event and for account-related issues via e-mail, phone or regular mail. Should you wish to opt-out of future communication, see the section below on Choice/Opt-out.

**Cookies  
**We use "cookies," a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Cookies benefit the user by requiring login only once, thereby saving time while on our site. If users reject the cookies, they may be limited in the use of some areas of our site. Cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our sites.

Some of our business affiliates use cookies on our sites in ads or promotions. However, we have no access to or control over these business affiliates' cookies; we urge users to read the privacy policies on these sites for information regarding the treatment of their information and data.

For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, browser type, navigation history and IP address of all visitors to our site. This information does not contain anything that can identify users personally. We use this information for our internal security audit log, trend analysis and system administration, and to gather broad demographic information about our user base for aggregate use.

We may combine demographic information supplied by a subscriber at registration with site usage data to provide general profiles, in aggregate non-personally identifiable form, about our users and their preferences in the content of the site and advertising. We may share this composite information with our advertisers and business affiliates to help them better understand our services.

**Special Policy on Information Regarding Children** (persons under 13 years of age)   
The Site is not directed to children, and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If you are concerned about your child's use of the site, you may use Web filtering technology to supervise or limit access to the site.

**With Whom Your Information Is Shared  
**We do not share credit card or other financial information with third parties other than for use in processing your payments for goods or services. We do not share your personal information with our affiliates, partners or third parties other than in the aggregate with one exception. We may share email and postal addresses gathered from this web site with those partners or affiliates that we feel may offer products or services that may be of interest to our readers and event attendees.

Except as otherwise provided in this privacy policy, RFID Journal Live! and RFID Journal University will keep your personal information and your financial information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of service. Users should also be aware that courts of equity, such as U.S. Bankruptcy Courts, might have the authority under certain circumstances to permit personal information to be shared or transferred to third parties without permission.

We may share aggregate information, which is not personally identifiable, with others. This information may include usage and demographic data, but it will not include personal information.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information  
**If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code) or if a user no longer desires our product(s)/service(s), we provide a way to correct or update that user's personal data. The user should contact Customer Support for the applicable product or service. Send an email to: info@rfidjournal.com

**Choice/Opt-Out  
**Our Web site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future communications and unsolicited email from us. To opt-out, send an email to info@rfidjournal.com. 

**Security**  
We use reasonable precautions to protect our users' personal information and to store it securely. Sensitive information that is transmitted to us online (such as credit card number) is encrypted and is transmitted to us securely. In addition, access to all of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information.

**Links**  
Our Web site contains links to other sites. Neither RFID Journal Live!, RFID Journal University nor RFID Journal is responsible for the privacy practices or content of such external sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each web site to which we may link that may collect personally identifiable information.

**Notification And Changes  
**If we change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so our users are aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under which circumstances, if any, we disclose it. Users should check this policy frequently to keep abreast of any changes.

For questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site or any dealings with RFID Journal Live!, RFID Journal University or RFID Journal, send e-mail to info@rfidjournal.com.
