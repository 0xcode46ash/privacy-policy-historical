We reserve the right to provide personally identifiable information as required by law or legal process to protect and defend the rights of Room & Board, Inc., our sites and users of our sites; or in the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event. In such cases, the disclosure of information will be as necessary to protect the personal safety of users of our sites or the public. 

**Links to third party web sites**   
Our sites may contain links to other Internet web sites that we think you may find of interest. Room & Board, Inc. is not responsible for the content of these sites, nor do we control, sponsor, endorse or approve them.
