We encourage you to read it whenever you visit our sites as the information may change without notice due to site enhancements, changes in the law and changes in technology. Rest assured that we will not sell, share or rent information gathered through our sites in ways different from what is disclosed here. 

We adhere to the Direct Marketer's Association's "Privacy Promise to American Customers" and the Childrenâ€™s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).

**Collecting and using your information**   
_Anonymous, non-personally identifiable information_ such as your IP address, domain server, type of computer, type of web browser, and addresses of referring sites, also known as "traffic data," may be collected and used to diagnose problems with our server and administer our sites. We may also use "cookies" and "action tags" to collect information. Cookies and action tags allow us to compile statistics and other information about how you use our sites. We may use this data to analyze trends and improve the usability of our sites as well as to administer the sites and gather broad demographic statistics. We may also share non-personally identifiable data with third parties on an aggregate basis. 

_Personally identifiable information_ such as your name, home address and email address may be required if you wish to communicate with us via email. This "contact information" may be used to respond to your email or contact you regarding a related matter. Our sites also give you the option to create a "wish list" of your favorite products. To create a wish list, you may be required to provide contact information and select a user name and password. This information may be used to provide you with personal services such as product order history, scheduled delivery information and other relevant notices not available to users who choose not to create a wish list. Submitting contact information and creating a wish list are strictly voluntary and are not required to use our sites.
