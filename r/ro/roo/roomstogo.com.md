The customer will also be contacted to confirm the delivery date and time. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the [choice/opt-out](https://web.archive.org/web/20021205152124id_/http%3A//www.roomstogo.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=choiceOptOut) section. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.
