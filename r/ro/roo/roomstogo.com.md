Privacy Statement

  
 **Roomstogo.com** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site: www.roomstogo.com. 

Registration

  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (like their name and e-mail address) and financial information (like their account or credit card numbers). We use customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about our company. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the visitor during business hours for either customer service support or any order-processing questions we may have. The customer will also be contacted to confirm the delivery date and time. We also may use registration information to provide customers with opportunities to purchase other products or services that we believe may be of interest to them. Users may opt-out of receiving e-mail marketing communications; see the [choice/opt-out](https://web.archive.org/web/20050401233229id_/http%3A//www.roomstogo.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=choiceOptOut) section. Financial information that is collected is used to check the users' qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Unique identifiers are collected to verify the user's identity and for use as account numbers in our record system.
