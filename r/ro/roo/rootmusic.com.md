The following sets forth our privacy practices and policies.

We will collect information about you when you register to post messages on one of our discussion forums, when you register to use BandPage or BandPage Plus, when you transmit information to us via our website or by email, when you participate in one of our promotions, and when you otherwise use this website.

The following describes the types of personal and other information we may collect about you, and how we use and maintain that information:

#### Contact Information

In general, you may visit our website without revealing any personal information other than technology-related information described in the section below. However, certain sections and features of our website are only available to registered users of our website, who must enter a unique user ID and password. We collect and store personal information related to each user ID when you register for an account and use our website. We also collect and store any personal information and other data you have provided to us via our website, by email, or otherwise. Specifically, we collect and store in a database your name, mailing address, and email address, and may also collect and store your phone number, date of birth and other information you may provide to us.

We use this information to respond to any inquiries you may submit to us, to track and monitor usage of our website and to communicate with you about your account and your use of our website. In addition, we may use this information to send you periodic publications associated with RootMusic, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications via email. We also use this information to operate this website; in particular, to facilitate postings on our discussion forums. We also use this information for targeted advertising and other marketing purposes.

#### Website Information

Our website collects and stores information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the website. This aggregate information is collected site-wide, and includes anonymous website statistics. Our website also employs browser cookies to store users’ preferences and record session information. “Cookies” are bits of information that are stored by your browser on your hard drive. This technology allows for the storage of user preferences, user ID and password, if applicable, and remembers you when you take action on our website. You can turn off the “cookie” function through most standard browsers; however, the majority of the features on our website may not function properly, including but not limited to, the login function, if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

In addition, when you visit our website our system automatically collects information such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser language, domain names, referring and exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of these page views, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request and the unique identity of your browser. This information is used to analyze trends, administer the website, improve the design of our website, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide. 

#### Credit Card Information

For users that purchase our BandPage Plus services, we collect credit card information. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing, but we do not store any credit card numbers in any way.

#### Information from Promotions

We collect information you give us when you participate in a RootMusic promotion, such as sweepstakes or contest. Specifically, you will typically be asked to provide your name, email address, and mailing address.

We store this information in our database and will use it to communicate with you about the promotion. We may also use this information to promote our services to you in the future, unless you inform us that you opt out from receiving such communications.

#### Other Information

We may retain any data you provide to us in an email or other inquiry, to track the types of questions we receive, analyze trends, administer the websites and services we offer, improve the design of our websites and services we offer, track user movement, and otherwise enhance the services we provide.

### WHEN YOUR INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED OR DISCLOSED

We will comply with any subpoenas, court orders or other legal processes for any of the information about you in our possession, and we may use such information to establish or exercise our legal rights, or to defend against legal claims. We reserve the right to disclose information about you, including data on which pages you have visited, to third parties if we feel it is necessary to protect our systems, website, business, users or others.

In addition, information about you in our possession may be disclosed as part of any merger, acquisition, sale of company assets, or transition of service to another provider, as well as in the unlikely event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership in which your personal information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the company. RootMusic does not guarantee that any entity receiving such information in connection with one of these transactions will comply with all terms of this policy.

### OPT OUT

As noted, once you register with RootMusic, we may send you administrative-related emails, as well as emails to facilitate your access to RootMusic’s services, including providing you with related updates. We may not offer you the opportunity to opt out of receiving these communications.

Unfortunately, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems but we do not accept liability for unintentional disclosure.

If we become aware that we have collected any personal information from children under 13, we will promptly delete such information from our databases.
