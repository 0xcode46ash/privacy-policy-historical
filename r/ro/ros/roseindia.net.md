I just srtetad I just srtetad using this software called socialblaster and it has been the best decision I have made in a long time. I see your marketing alot on youtube and wanted to tell you about a technique that automates marketing across 40 + social networks with multiple accounts, send scheduled text updates with links to 40 social networks on sites like tiwtter and many more. No more for me!
