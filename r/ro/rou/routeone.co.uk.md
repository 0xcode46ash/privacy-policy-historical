# Security and Privacy

  
TKC Direct Limited ("Route One") is totally committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers. The Route One team members are customers themselves of other Internet sites and fully appreciate and respect the importance of privacy on the Internet. We will not disclose information about our customers to third parties except where it is part of providing a service to you - e.g. arranging for a product to be sent to you, carrying out credit and other security checks and for the purposes of customer research and profiling or where we have your express permission to do so. 

#### IS IT SAFE TO ORDER ONLINE?

Safer than it's ever been. We use one of the most secure online ordering systems on the market, and are constantly researching and improving our software to make sure we offer the highest possible security at all times.

We utilise industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to allow for the encryption of potentially sensitive information such as your name, address and other critically sensitive information like your credit card details. Information passed between your computer and our website cannot be read in the event someone else intercepts it. This technology includes the following features: 

  * Authentication - this assures your browser that your data is being sent to the correct computer server, and that the server is secure 
  * Encryption - this encodes the data, so that it cannot be read by anyone other than the secure server 
  * Data Integrity - this checks the data being transferred to ensure it has not been altered 



#### Your Consent 

We will not sell your name, address, e-mail address, credit card information or personal information to any third party (excluding partners from whom you may have linked to our site) without your permission. 

#### Communication & Marketing

If you have made a purchase from our store we may occasionally update you on our latest products, news and special offers via e-mail, post & telephone. You will also be given the opportunity to receive such communications from us and selected third parties when you become a member of Route One. 

All Route One members have the option to opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us and/or selected third parties. If you do not wish to continue to receive marketing from us and/or selected third parties you should opt-out by visiting 'Your Details' in 'Your Account' on the Route One website. You can access 'Your Account' once you register and login. Or click on the "unsubscribe" link in any email communications which might we send you. 

#### What are Cookies?

A cookie is a small information file that is sent to your computer and is stored on your hard drive. If you have registered with us then your computer will store an identifying cookie which will save you time each time you re-visit Route One, by remembering your email address for you. You can change the settings on your browser to prevent cookies being stored on your computer without your explicit consent.

#### Checking your Details
