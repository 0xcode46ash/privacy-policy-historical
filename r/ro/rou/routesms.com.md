### Data Privacy and GDPR

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) comes into force across the European Union on 25th May 2018 and brings with it the most significant changes to data protection law in two decades. Based on privacy by design and taking a risk-based approach, the GDPR has been designed to meet the requirements of the digital age.

The 21st Century brings with it, a broader use of technology, new definitions of what constitutes personal data; and a vast increase in cross-border processing. The new Regulation aims to standardise data protection laws and processing across the EU;affording individuals stronger, more consistent rights to access and control their personal information.

##### Our Commitment

**Route Mobile Limited** is committed to ensure the security and protection of the personal information that we process, and to provide a compliant and consistent approach to data protection. We have always had a robust and effective data protection policyin place which complies with existing law and abides by the data protection principles. However, we recognise our obligations in updating and expanding our Data Protection program to meet the demands of the GDPR and the Indian Information Technology Act, 2000 and The Indian Contract Act, 1872.

**Route Mobile Limited** is dedicated to safeguarding the personal information under our remit and indeveloping a data protection regime that is effective, fit for purpose and demonstrates an understanding of, and appreciation for the new Regulation. Our preparation and objectives for GDPR compliance have been summarised in this statement and include the development and implementation of new data protection roles, policies, procedures, controls and measures to ensure maximum and ongoing compliance.

##### How we are preparing for GDPR

**Route Mobile Limited** already have a consistent level of data protection and security across our organisation, however it is our aim to be fully compliant with the GDPR by 25th May 2018.

_Our preparation includes: -_

  * **Information Audit** \- carrying out a company-wide information audit to identify and assess what personal information we hold, where it comes from, how and why it is processed, and if and to whom,it is disclosed.
  * **Policies & Procedures** \- revising data protection policies and procedures to meet the requirements and standards of the GDPR and any relevant data protection laws, including: -
  *     * **Data Protection** – our main policy and procedure document for data protection is being overhauled to meet the standards and requirements of the GDPR. Accountability and governance measures are in place to ensure that we understand and adequately disseminate and evidence our obligations and responsibilities; with a dedicated focus on privacy by design and the rights of individuals.
    * **Data Retention & Erasure** – we are updating our retention policy and schedule to ensure that we meet the ‘data minimization’ and ‘storage limitation’ principles and that personal information is stored, archived and destroyed compliantly and ethically. We are developing dedicated erasure procedures to meet the new ‘Right to Erasure’ obligation and are aware of when this and other data subject’s rights apply; along with any exemptions, response timeframes and notification responsibilities.
    * **Data Breaches** – our breach procedures ensure that we have safeguards and measures in place to identify, assess, investigate and report any personal data breach at the earliest possible time. Our procedures are robust and have been disseminated to all employees, making them aware of the reporting lines and steps to follow. If there is any data breach, Route Mobile Limited will notify its customers after becoming aware ofthe breach and provide necessary support and assistance to the customers.
    * **International Data Transfers & Third-Party Disclosures** – where Route Mobile Limited stores or transfers personal information outside the EU, we have robust procedures and safeguarding measures in place to secure, encrypt and maintain the integrity of the data.

    * **Subject Access Request (SAR)** – we are revising our SAR procedures to accommodate the revised 30-day timeframe for providing the requested information and for making this provision free of charge. Our new procedures detail how to verify the data subject, what steps to take for processing an access request, what exemptions apply and a suite of response templates to ensure that communications with data subjects are compliant, consistent and adequate.
  * **Legal Basis for Processing** \- we are reviewing all processing activities to identify the legal basis for processing and ensuring that each basis is appropriate for the activity it relates to. Where applicable, we also maintain records of our processing activities, ensuring that our obligations under Article 30 of the GDPR and Schedule 1 of the Data Protection Bill are met.
