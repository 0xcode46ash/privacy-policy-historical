**3\. HOW DO WE USE THE INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT?**

**RCCL uses the information it collects to provide you with the best cruise-planning and cruise vacation experience.**

RCCL uses the information it collects:

  * **To manage your bookings with us and provide the products, services or membership benefits you request when using the Digital Platforms, including providing services to your exact location on the ship.**



We need to use your personal information to deliver our services to you when you book a cruise.  For example, when you travel with us we need your personal information to send you a booking confirmation, to manage changes to your booking, to send invoices to you and process your payments, to check you in before you board our ships and to keep track of you on board, to deliver your benefits for our loyalty programs, to provide you with further products and services on board (for example when you book shore excursions and in our shops, restaurants and casinos) or through the Digital Platforms (for example, the chat service offered through the Application).

  * **To improve the content of the Digital Platforms and enhance your cruise-planning experience**



The personal information we collect when you use our Digital Platforms helps us to make sure that our Digital Platforms works well (for example, so that we know it’s you when you sign into our account).  We are always improving the design and content of our Digital Platforms to enhance your cruise vacation experience and information about how you use our Digital Platforms helps us to do that.  We also use this information to help us understand the level of interest in the different sections of our Digital Platforms and the products and services that we offer.  We also use your information to make the cruise vacation booking process more convenient.  For example, we can remember what you’ve searched for, so you can pick up where you left off.

We also use your information to fix operational problems with the Digital Platforms such as pages crashing and software bugs and maintain the safety and security of the Digital Platforms.

  * **To personalise your RCCL account, including your preferred Royal Caribbean cruise destinations**



When you sign up via the Digital Platforms or make a booking, we create a Unified Guest Account in our systems.  If you have an existing Royal Caribbean account, such as a ‘My Cruises’ account or a ‘My Celebrity’ account, when you next sign-in you will be required to migrate to a bigger and better new Unified Guest Account. This is your digital profile that brings the personal information that we hold together and identifies you across the Royal Caribbean International group.  When you migrate to your new Unified Guest Account the information from your existing Royal Caribbean account will also be transferred across.

Your Guest Profile lets us deliver a personalised experience when you search for cruises, book and travel with us or contact us by phone or email.  We also use your Unified Guest Account to personalise the marketing communications that we send you.  We also sometimes use your details to ask for feedback on our services. ****

  * **To process payments and invoicing**
