If you have any questions concerning this privacy policy please email us. 

**Please read this Privacy Policy carefully and in its entirety. By using the Royal Draw website, you certify that you have read this Privacy Policy, understand it, and agree to abide by all of the terms contained herein, as well as to abide by the Terms of Use for the Site. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy and/or the Terms of Use, please discontinue use of this Site.**

*  **Privacy Policy modifications** Royal Coupon reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any time. If significant modifications are made to the terms of our Privacy Policy we will post notice of said changes to this Privacy Policy, and may email notification to our subscribers, in order to keep you aware at all times of what information we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances we may disclose that information, if any. It is recommended that you re-read this page every so often to ensure you are up-to-date with our existing policies regarding the collection and use of your information. 
* **Types of information collected and uses of collected information** Royal Coupon collects two types of information about our Users: Personally Identifying Information and Non-Personally Identifying Information. We also may ask you to supply information on people you refer our Draws to. 

**Personally Identifying Information**   
Personally Identifying Information is information that is used to identify a specific User. Personally Identifying Information is collected when you engage in activities on the Site that requires you to voluntarily enter in information, such as creating or updating an account, entering a Draw, posting to the blog or discussion board, applying for a job, filling out a survey sending feedback to us or our affiliates, requesting information about us or our affiliates, submitting an affiliate agreement, or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Site (collectively referred to as "Identifying Activities"). In such cases, you may be asked to supply certain Personally Identifying Information, such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, mailing address (including postal code), city of residence, date of birth, and, should you be required to pay for entry in any of our Draws, your credit card number information, including type of credit card, credit card number, expiry date, and authentication code. With the exception of credit card information, your Personally Identifying Information will be stored on our system for the purposes of our operations, and for your user convenience. 

Depending on the activity you engage in, some of the information we ask you to provide will be mandatory, and some will be voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, such as an email address when creating an account, you will not be allowed to engage in that activity. If you use our Site to send information or offers, we may store any Personally Identifying Information attached to what you send. 

Your Personally Identifying Information is used to offer and provide you with Draw notifications, improve Site operation, analyze Site use, conduct our Draws, improve marketing promotions, improve our Draws, and to optimize your experience with Royal Draw, Royal Coupon, and any third parties as laid out in this Privacy Policy. 

If you send Royal Coupon an email commenting on the deals, goods, or services subject to our Site, we may use your comments and feedback either internally or externally. We may publish your comments and feedback as a testimonial, and/or to inform others about our services, or to promote our Site or our Draws. We may also post your comment in our internal documents, and/or on our Site. Prior to posting your comments publicly on our Site, we will secure consent from you to use your name along with your comment. In submitting a comment or reply to our social media, such as the Royal Coupon or Royal Draw blog, Facebook page, or Twitter feed, you are agreeing to have that comment be shown publicly. 

We may also use Personally Identifying Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot our Site, emails, or other online content, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, to assert enforcement of the terms of our agreements with you (including our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy) according to any and all applicable laws, and/or in cooperation with law enforcement actions. 

**Non-Personally Identifying Information**   
Non-Personally Identifying Information is information that does not represent or identify a specific User. Non-Personally Identifying Information includes things like the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the computer you use to access our Site, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Site, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Site, and the type of browser you use when accessing our Site. We and/or our authorized third party service providers and advertisers, may collect this information automatically through the use of electronic information collection tools like cookies and web beacons or pixel tags, as laid out in this Privacy Policy. 

We use Non-Personally Identifying Information to help us manage and troubleshoot the Site, analyze usage trends, gather User demographic information, comply with applicable laws, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may share Non-Personally Identifying Information with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. 

* Release of Personally Identifying Information 

Royal Coupon shall not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your Personally Identifying Information with other parties except as described below: 

**Sharing your information with Requesting Merchants**   
From time to time Royal Coupon may share your Personally Identifying Information with particular Merchants who request Information on Users who win their Draw in order to help facilitate prize issuance (referred to as "Requesting Merchants"). Sharing this Information may allow a Requesting Merchant to market to you directly if they choose to do so. However, we only share Personally Identifying Information with a Requesting Merchant if you win the Requesting Merchant's Draw. We inform any and all such Requesting Merchants that they are only permitted to your Personally Identifying Information to communicate with you for purposes relating to the specific Draw associated with Royal Draw. Royal Coupon is in no way liable or responsible for the actions of a Requesting Merchant who uses your information to contact you for purposes not relating to the specific promotion associated with Royal Draw, and such actions are not under our control. 

**Sharing you information with authorized Third Party Service Providers**   
Royal Coupon may share your Personally Identifying Information with Third Party Service Providers in order to operate or troubleshoot the Site, fulfill customer requests, deliver packages, remove repetitive information on customer lists, provide search results and links, administer Draws, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide customer service, and/or to process credit card payments if applicable. Royal Coupon may also collect Personally information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships (referred to as "Affiliates"), and may share your information with Third Parties to perform administrative functions. For example, when you win a Draw, we release your shipping information to the shipping provider. We may also release an Affiliate's information to our bank in order to send out a payment. 

**Remarketing your information**   
Royal Coupon may remarket your information. Remarketing enables us to connect with Users based on their past interactions with the Site. We may hire third-party marketing vendors to perform remarketing services on our behalf. As a result, third-party vendors, including search engines like Google, may show Royal Coupon or Royal Draw advertisements. Third-party vendors use cookies to collect User information in order to serve ads based on a User's prior visits to the Royal Draw Site. This information shall be used only for remarketing purposes, and will not be used by third-party vendors for any other purpose. If you would like to opt out of the use of cookies by third-party vendors please contact them directly. 

**Sharing your information in a business transfer**   
Like all businesses, Royal Coupon Inc. could merge with, or be annexed by another company. Should this occur, that company would inherit and be able to access the information we store, including Personally Identifying Information. In such case, the Personally Identifying Information would remain subject to this Privacy Policy. 

**Sharing your information for our protection and the protection of others**   
Royal Coupon reserves the right to disclose your Personally Identifying Information as required by law when we have reason to believe that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights; to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Site; to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Use, or other Agreements; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of the Site, its Users, or others. 

* **Release of Non-Personally Identifying Information** Royal Coupon may release or share Non-Personally Identifying Information, such as composite demographic information, with partners, affiliates, and advertisers, which includes Third Party Advertisers or Third Party Advertising Companies, and other parties as outlined below. 

Third Party Advertising Companies may be employed by Royal Coupon to provision ads when you visit our Site. These companies may use Non-Personally Identifying Information collected during and with regards to your visits to the Site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you through the use of network tags. Some of these companies may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"). If you wish to learn more about the NAI or any NAI member company, or if you wish to opt out of the targeted advertising initiative of any NAI member company, visit the [ NAI website](http://www.networkadvertising.org/). 

We may also use Third Party Service Providers to track and analyze non-personally identifying usage and volume statistical information from our Users to administer our Site and continuously improve its quality. We may publish this statistical information for promotional purposes, or to represent audience for advertisers. None of this statistical information constitutes Personally Identifying Information, and it is used and published only as general representative summaries of the activities of our Users. This statistical information and data is owned and used by us, and is collected on our behalf. 

* **Updating and deleting information** Royal Coupon believes that you should have the ability to access and edit your provided and stored Personally Identifying Information. At any time you may manually change any of your Personally Identifying Information by logging into your account, or you can send Royal Coupon an email request at [info@royalcoupon.com](mailto:info@royalcoupon.com), or a written request to:

At any time you may ask to have the information attached to your account deleted or removed, excepting information connecting to past transactions on our Site as this information is also stored as Royal Coupon transaction information, which is tracked by us. We may not be able to completely delete all of your information as we periodically backup information.
