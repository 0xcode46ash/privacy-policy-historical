If significant modifications are made to the terms of our Privacy Policy we will post notice of said changes to this Privacy Policy, and may email notification to our subscribers, in order to keep you aware at all times of what information we collect, how we use that information, and under what circumstances we may disclose that information, if any. It is recommended that you re-read this page every so often to ensure you are up-to-date with our existing policies regarding the collection and use of your information. 
* **Types of information collected and uses of collected information** Royal Coupon collects two types of information about our Users: Personally Identifying Information and Non-Personally Identifying Information. We also may ask you to supply information on people you refer our offers to, or make purchases for. 

**Personally Identifying Information**   
Personally Identifying Information is information that is used to identify a specific User. Personally Identifying Information is collected when you engage in activities on the Site that require you to voluntarily enter in information, such as creating or updating an account, purchasing a Deal, redeeming points at the Points Store, applying for a job, publishing/posting content in discussion forums or comment areas, filling out a survey or form, entering a draw or sweepstakes through our Site, sending feedback to us or our Partners, requesting information about us or our partners, or signing up for special offers from third parties through the Site (collectively referred to as "Identifying Activities"). In such cases, you may be asked to supply certain Personally Identifying Information, such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, mailing address (including postal code), city of residence, date of birth, and, in the case of purchasing a Deal or other service with us, your credit card number information, including type of credit card, credit card number, expiry date, and authentication code. With the exception of credit card information, your Personally Identifying Information will be stored on our system for the purposes of our operations, and for User convenience. 

Depending on the activity you wish to engage in, some of the information we ask you to provide will be mandatory, and some will be voluntary. If you do not provide mandatory information for a particular activity that requires it, such as an email address when creating an account or credit card information when purchasing a Deal, you will not be allowed to engage in that activity. If you use our Site to send information or offers, we may store any Personally Identifying Information attached to what you send. 

Your Personally Identifying Information is used to offer and provide you with goods and services, improve Site operation, analyze Site use, conduct contests, improve marketing promotions, improve our goods and services offers, and to customize your experience with third parties as laid out in this Privacy Policy. If you send Royal Coupon an email commenting on the deals, goods, or services subject to our Site, we may use your comments and feedback either internally or externally. We may publish your comments and feedback as a testimonial, and/or to inform others about our services, or promote our Site or our offers. We may also post your comment in our internal marketing documents, and/or on our Site. Prior to posting your comments publicly on our Site, we will secure consent from you to use your full name along with your comment. In submitting a comment or reply to our social media, such as the Royal Coupon or Royal Draw blog, Facebook page, or Twitter feed, you are agreeing to have that comment be shown publicly. 

We may also use Personally Identifying Information to resolve disputes, troubleshoot our Site, send promotional emails, accomplish administrative tasks, contact you, assert enforcement of the terms of our agreements with you (including our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy) according to any and all applicable laws, and/or in cooperation with law enforcement actions. 

**Non-Personally Identifying Information**   
Non-Personally Identifying Information is information that does not represent or identify a specific User. Non-Personally Identifying Information includes things like the Internet Protocol ("IP") address of the computer you use to access our Site, the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website you visited before coming to our Site, the URL of the website you visit after leaving our Site, and the type of browser you use when accessing our Site. We and/or our authorized third party service providers and advertisers, may collect this information automatically through the use of electronic information collection tools like cookies and web beacons or pixel tags, as laid out in this Privacy Policy. 

We use Non-Personally Identifying Information to help us manage and troubleshoot the Site, analyze usage trends, gather User demographic information, comply with applicable laws, and cooperate with law enforcement activities. We may share Non-Personally Identifying Information with our authorized third party service providers and advertisers to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, and programming. 

* **Release of Personally Identifying Information**

Royal Coupon shall not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your Personally Identifying Information with other parties except as described below: 

**Sharing information with Requesting Merchants**   
From time to time Royal Coupon may share your Personally Identifying Information with particular Merchants who request Information on customers who purchase their Deal in order to help facilitate redemption or delivery (referred to as "Requesting Merchants"). Sharing this Information may allow a Requesting Merchant to market to you directly if they choose to do so. However, we will only share Personally Identifying Information with a Requesting Merchant if you engage in an Identifying Activity directly connected to that specific Requesting Merchant, i.e. when you buy a Deal through our Site from that Requesting Merchant. We inform any and all such Requesting Merchants that they are only permitted to your Personally Identifying Information to communicate with you for purposes relating to the specific promotion associated with Royal Coupon. Royal Coupon is in no way liable or responsible for the actions of a Requesting Merchant who uses your information to contact you for purposes not relating to the specific promotion associated with Royal Coupon, and such actions are not under our control. 

**Sharing information with authorized Third-Party Service Providers**   
Royal Coupon provides services and products through Third-Party Service Providers (referred to as "Third-Party Service Providers") who perform functions on our behalf, such as sending and distributing Royal Coupon's administrative and promotional emails. Royal Coupon may share your Personally Identifying Information with Third-Party Service Providers in order to operate or troubleshoot the Site, fulfill customer orders, send mail or email, deliver packages, remove repetitive information on customer lists, provide search results and links, administer draws or sweepstakes, analyze data, provide marketing assistance, provide customer service, and/or to process credit card payments. Royal Coupon may also collect Personally Identifying Information from individuals and companies with whom we have business relationships (referred to as "Partners"), and may share your information with third parties to perform administrative functions. For example, when you make a purchase, we release your credit card information to the card-issuing bank to confirm payment. We may also release a Partner's information to our bank in order to send out a payment. 

We encourage Requesting Merchants and Third-Party Service Providers to adopt and post their own privacy policies.

Both parties are contractually obligated to use the same degree of care used in protecting its own confidential information from unauthorized disclosure to protect all User Data in its possession. 

One or both parties may disclose User Data only to the extent necessary to comply with its legal obligations if so required by law or a court order, wherein the recipient shall, if possible, give the User prompt written notice, and cooperate with the User at the User’s expense in any effort the User wants to undertake to obtain a protective order.
