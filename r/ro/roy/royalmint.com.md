When information is found to be inaccurate, either through our own checks or following a communication from you, it is updated.

## **Who might we share your information with?**

We do not sell, rent or otherwise trade your personal data with others. While most of our work is done by our employees who access your personal data directly from our systems which are under our direct control, we do use third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf.

We have listed below the types of providers, the types of information that they would have access to and the purpose for the transfer of your personal data.

Please note that if we are requested by the police, government, regulatory, or other body investigating suspected illegal activities to provide your personal data and/or user details, we are entitled to do so.

## **What do we do with your information?**

We will use your personal data for the following purposes:

  * Processing your order/request for products and/or services;
  * Administer our websites, including providing our website content and advertisements;

Your credit score will be used by us in conjunction with information that you provide as part of your application, along with information regarding your account conduct (if an existing customer), and official public records such as fraud and insolvency records. The use of credit scoring helps us make fair and responsible lending decisions. If your application for credit is declined you are able to request that this is reconsidered, based on a change of circumstances or a correction of your credit report (if an error was found). The credit scoring used is regularly tested by the professional services provider to ensure that it remains fair, effective and unbiased.
