_Cookies  
_ Some Royal Mint web pages use "cookies", which are small files that may be placed on your hard disk for record-keeping purposes. For example, when you enter our online shop a cookie will be created to store your order. Cookies can make your subsequent visits to the web page simpler and more seamless. 

You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.)

_Tracking user sessions  
_ When you visit our website your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) is logged to track your session.

This is automatically recognised by the Web server and is only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which the Royal Mint uses to evaluate use of the site. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable to you and therefore you remain anonymous.

_Tracking marketing activity  
_ The Royal Mint uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our advertisement management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website. The cookie was placed by us, or by another advertiser who works with DoubleClick. With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address. For more information about DoubleClick, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, go to [_http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy_](http://www.doubleclick.net/us/corporate/privacy).
