When you visit our website your IP address (the Internet address of your computer) is logged to track your session.

This is automatically recognised by the Web server and is only used for system administration and to provide statistics, which the Royal Mint uses to evaluate use of the site. We do not link your IP address to anything personally identifiable to you and therefore you remain anonymous.

_Tracking marketing activity_

The Royal Mint uses pixels, or transparent GIF files, to help manage online advertising. These GIF files are provided by our advertisement management partner, DoubleClick. These files enable DoubleClick to recognize a unique cookie on your Web browser, which in turn enables us to learn which advertisements bring users to our website.

With both cookies and Spotlight technology, the information that we collect and share is anonymous and not personally identifiable. It does not contain your name, address, telephone number, or email address.
