Personal Data includes special categories of Personal Data and pseudonymised Personal Data but excludes anonymous data or data that has had the identity of an individual permanently removed.

Special categories of Personal Data is information revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health conditions, sexual life, sexual orientation, biometric or genetic data, and Personal Data relating to criminal offences and convictions.

Pseudonymisation or pseudonymised is the replacing of information that directly or indirectly identifies an individual with one or more artificial identifiers or pseudonyms so that the person, to whom the data relates, cannot be identified without the use of additional information which is kept separately and secure.

Access to this biometric data is strictly limited to security staff in the exercise of their duties.

We do not routinely collect Personal Data about children under 16. There are a limited number of activities that we undertake which may involve the collection of children’s’ Personal Data, for example competition entries and photo/video permission forms.

## **Who might we share your information with?**

We do not sell, rent or otherwise trade your Personal Data with others. While most of our work is done by our employees who access your Personal Data directly from our systems which are under our direct control, we do use third-party service providers to perform certain functions on our behalf.

We have listed below examples of the kind of third- party service providers that we work with. We have also listed examples of the types of information that they may have access to and reasons that we may need to share your Personal Data with them.

For further information on which service providers may have access to your personal data, please contact us.

Please note that if we are requested by the police, government, regulatory, or other body investigating suspected illegal activities to provide your personal data and/or user details, we are entitled to do so.

## **Do we transfer information between countries?**

**www.royalmint.com**

It may sometimes be necessary to transfer your personal data overseas. When this is needed your personal data may be transferred to countries or territories outside of the EEA. Any transfers made will be in full compliance with all aspects of the data protection laws and regulations applicable in the United Kingdom.

We may only transfer your personal data outside the EEA if one of the following conditions applies:

  * The European Commission has issued a decision confirming that the country to which we transfer personal data ensures an adequate level of protection for the data subject’s rights and freedoms: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm ;  

  * Appropriate safeguards are in place such as binding corporate rules (BCR), model contractual clauses, an approved code of conduct or a certification mechanism;
  * You have provided your explicit consent to the transfer after being informed of any potential risks; or
  * The transfer is necessary for one of the other reasons set out in the GDPR including the performance of a contract between us and you, reasons of public interest, to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, to fulfil our legal or regulatory obligations, or to protect your vital interests where you’re physically or legally incapable of giving consent and, in some limited cases, for our legitimate interests.



For further information on which countries your personal data may be transferred to and the specific safeguards that are in place, contact us.

## **www.royalmintbullion.com**

Same details as for www.royalmint.com.

We envisage that we will transfer your personal data to the United States of American and Serbia. This is because we utilise an IT support and data storage provider that is based in the United States of America and this information can also be accessed by a support team based in Serbia. Any transfers are made in full compliance with all aspects of the data protection laws and regulations applicable in the United Kingdom. Model contractual clauses are utilised in this instance to safeguard your Personal Data.

## **How long do we keep hold of your information?**

We keep your Personal Data for as long as we need it to satisfy our business and legal requirements; normally this is no longer than 12 months after you cease holding a customer account. Once the Personal Data is no longer required, it is either deleted or anonymised.

It is important to note that all employees at The Royal Mint follow an organisation-wide security policy. Only employees authorised are provided access to Personal Data and these employees will have agreed to ensure confidentiality of this information.

Also specifically with respect to debit and credit card information submitted through our websites, we use secure socket layer technology to protect that information.

## **What rights do I have in relation to the personal data you hold about me?**

Unless subject to an exemption, you have the following rights with respect to your Personal Data:

  * The right to request a copy of your Personal Data which The Royal Mint holds about you;
  * The right to request that we correct any Personal Data if it is found to be inaccurate or out of date;
  * The right to request your Personal Data is erased where it is no longer necessary for us to retain such data;
  * The right to withdraw your consent to the processing at any time where we are relying on your consent as the legal basis for processing your Personal Data;
  * Where applicable, the right to request that we transfer your Personal Data directly to another data controller, (known as the right to data portability);
  * The right, where there is a dispute in relation to the accuracy or processing of your Personal Data, to request a restriction is placed on further processing;
  * The right to object to the processing of Personal Data where processing is based on legitimate interests, the performance of a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority, direct marketing and processing for the purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics;
  * The right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner’s Office.



## **How can I access or correct my Personal Data, request that it be deleted, ask for it to be transferred to another organisation or exercise any of my other rights?  **

The majority of the Personal Data that we collect is collected directly from you, in which case you are responsible for its accuracy. We encourage you to tell us as soon as possible if there are any changes to your Personal Data, such as a new address. When information is found to be inaccurate, either through our own checks or following a communication from you, it is updated.

You can update your Personal Data at any time by logging into your account and choosing contact and delivery details.

To update your contact preferences you should select this option within contact and delivery details.

Alternatively, contact customer services using the following information:

  * Telephone: 0800 032 2154
  * E-mail: customer.services@royalmint.com

For further information regarding this policy, to access your Personal Data, request that it be deleted, or ask for it to be transferred to another organisation, please contact the Data Protection Officer by using the above mentioned contact details.

## **How can I make a complaint about how you have handled my Personal Data or responded to a request to exercise my data subject rights?**

If you are dissatisfied with the handling of your Personal Data or how we have responded to a request to exercise your data subject rights, you have the right to ask for an internal review.  An internal review will consider whether or not your Personal Data and/or request were handled appropriately, in line with applicable data protection laws and regulations.

Internal review requests should be submitted to the Data Protection Officer by using the contact information above. Internal reviews will be carried out by the Finance Director. We aim to respond within 20 working days of the receipt of the request for an internal review.

If you are dissatisfied with the outcome of the review, then you may seek a review by the Information Commissioner’s office, which has the powers to uphold or overturn the decision. Please see ICO contact information below.  The Royal Mint will abide by the decisions of the ICO, unless it considers itself to have grounds for an appeal to the First-Tier Tribunal (Information Rights).
