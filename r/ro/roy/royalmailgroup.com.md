**Our promise to you**   
This website is owned and operated by Royal Mail Group plc. We take your privacy seriously, and to protect it we comply with the principles contained within this policy. 

**What this privacy policy does not cover**   
This policy does not apply to the practices of companies Royal Mail Group does not own or control, or to people we do not employ or manage.

Royal Mail Group complies with the Data Protection Act 1998. This privacy policy meets the standards and guidelines contained in the Act. 

**Collection and use of personal information**   
From time to time we may ask you to provide us with your personal information. By providing your personal information, you agree to the collection, storage and use of your personal information by Royal Mail Group in the manner set out in this privacy policy.

**Disclosure of information**   
Royal Mail will not sell your personal information or otherwise disclose it to a third party without your consent, provided that we may disclose it within the Royal Mail group of companies if necessary for the operation of our website. Other parts of the Royal Mail group of companies follow privacy policies and practices similar to this policy. 

**Links**   
This website links to other sites. We make every effort to provide links to high quality, reputable sites. However, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of these sites and they are not under our day to day control. We cannot accept responsibility for their use of your data, the site content or the services offered to you by these sites. 

**Accessing personal data**   
You can contact us to ask what personal data we hold about you by sending an email to [stuart.l.harvey@royalmail.com](mailto:stuart.l.harvey@royalmail.com "Email Stuart Harvey") or by writing to Stuart Harvey, Data Protection Act Services, Royal Mail Group PLC, PO Box 341, ALDERSHOT, GU11 1WW.

**Security**   
Security is of primary importance to Royal Mail. We have implemented technology and security policies, rules and measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control, both on and off-line, from improper access, use, alteration, destruction and loss. 

Off-line, all of your personal information is kept securely in our offices. Only employees and contractors are granted access to personally identifiable information and then only if they need the information to carry out a specific authorised task. 

The servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

**Changes to this privacy policy**   
Royal Mail may amend this policy from time to time. If we make any changes we will notify you by posting a prominent announcement on this website. 

**Thank you**   
Thank you for reading our privacy policy - we hope it has fully answered any questions you may have had about how we collect and use your personal information.
