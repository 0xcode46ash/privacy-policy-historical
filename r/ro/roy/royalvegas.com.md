# Royal Vegas Casino Security & Privacy Policy

Royal Vegas Casino is utterly committed to the highest possible standards of security. We use 128-bit SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Digital Encryption to protect your online transactions. These are the most sophisticated commercial internet security methods currently available. These same systems are used by all major banks and financial institutions. We regularly review and update them to ensure that the protection we provide you with is always completely up to date. 

Only reputable electronic cash merchants are used for all your transactions and your account number and password are required to authorize these. This provides an extra layer of security verification in that it is not possible to make a transaction on your behalf without your unique details.
