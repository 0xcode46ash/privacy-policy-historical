## Privacy statement – Data Protection Act 1998

In the National Health Service (NHS), we aim to provide you with the highest quality healthcare. To do this we must keep information about you, your health and the care we have provided to you or plan to provide to you. This fair processing notice provides a summary of how we use your information.

The Data Protection Act controls how your personal information is used by organisations, businesses or the government. Under the act the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is defined as a ‘data controller’ of personal information. This is collected by the trust to help us provide and manage healthcare to our patients. The trust is registered with the Information Commissioners Office (2014 registration number Z6460180).

If you are looking for information about privacy while using our website, please [read our terms and conditions](https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/about-us/corporate-information-and-accountability/terms-and-conditions).

## What kind of personal information does the trust collect?

  * Name, address, date of birth, NHS number and next of kin
  * Details of diagnosis, treatment and hospital visits
  * Allergies and health conditions



## Why we collect information about you

The people who care for you use your information and records to:

  * provide a good basis for all health decisions made by you and your care professionals
  * allow you to work with those providing care
  * make sure your care is safe and effective
  * work effectively with those providing you with care



Others in the NHS may also need to use records about you to:

  * check the quality of care (called clinical audit)
  * protect the health of the general public and manage the health service
  * keep track of our spending
  * help investigate any concerns or complaints you or your family have about your health care
  * teach healthcare workers and help with research



## Information sharing with non-NHS organisations

For your benefit we may need to share information from your health records with non-NHS organisations, from which you are also receiving care, such as social services or private healthcare organisations. We will only share information with non-NHS organisations with your permission if the information is required for purposes other than the provision of care to you. However, in exceptional situations we may need to share information without your permission if:

  * it is in the public interest – for example, there is a risk of death or serious harm
  * there is a legal need to share it – for example, to protect a child under the Children Act 1989
  * a court order tells us that we must share it
  * there is a legitimate enquiry from the police under the Data Protection Act (1998) for information related to a serious crime.



### Your right to withdraw consent for your information to be shared

You have the right to withdraw and refuse consent to information sharing at any time, but note that not sharing your information may affect the quality and safety of the care you receive. For further information please contact the data protection officer using the details below.
