**Privacy Policy**

At Royal LePage, we respect the privacy and security of our Internet users. Personally identifying information collected on this web site is not disclosed to any third party without user consent, except to select business partners with whom we have established privacy agreements consistent with this privacy policy.

To help you better understand how we collect and use information collected on our web site, we provide the following description of our online information practices:

Royal LePage records IP (Internet Protocol) address numbers and other site usage statistics in order to better understand how visitors use our web site.

**Registration Forms:**

Personal information gathered from registration forms (such as name, email or street address) is used to send information related to our products and services to consenting users. When you indicate that you want to receive a product or service, or contact a person or organization, we share the data needed for you to receive what you have indicated. 

**Email Services:**

Users who register for the email notification feature on our web site will receive email bulletins. Royal LePage provides the opportunity to unsubscribe to an email service at any time.

**Surveys:**

Royal LePage uses information gathered from online surveys to establish customer demographics, identify user preferences and strengthen customer relations. User participation is always optional. Aggregate data may be disclosed to third parties, but never with personally identifying information.

**Contests:**

In order to enter a contest, Royal LePage requires that you submit a limited amount of personally identifying information. In addition to contacting contest winners, the information you provide may be used to establish customer demographics and identify user preferences. Aggregate data may be disclosed to third parties, but never with personally identifying information.

We may also share information attained from contest entries with Royal LePage sales representatives, who may contact you. This will be posted on the contest entry form if applicable.

**HomeFind Property Search Forms:**

By completing the Royal LePage HomeFind Property Search form, you are requesting that a Royal LePage sales representative contact you with information on selected properties. The information you provide to us when completing the HomeFind Property Search Form, will be directed to a Royal LePage sales representative, who will contact you by the method (email, telephone or mail) selected by you.

**Consent:**

By using any of these services, you consent to the collection and use of personal information, as described in this policy. Where required by law, an acknowledgment of that consent will be included in the form you are asked to complete. You may also withdraw your consent at any time. If you do not give consent, or you later withdraw it, you may not be able to receive certain services that rely on the collection and use of personal information.

**Security:**

Royal LePage is serious about security. Our computer system uses a combination of hardware and software designed to protect against unauthorized entry and loss, theft, or misuse of personal information. Although we will make every effort to protect personal information, no computer system is immune from hackers and others who might misuse information. We are not responsible for any breach of security that is beyond our reasonable control.

**Third Party Service Providers:**

Third parties provide some of the services on the Royal LePage web site. Please be aware that third party service providers may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We encourage you to review any privacy policies or notices posted by those service providers.

We encourage you to review any privacy policies or notices posted on those linked sites. 

**Contacting Us:**

If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us at **[info@royallepage.ca](mailto:info@royallepage.ca)**.

This Royal LePage privacy policy does not extend to any information that is inherent in the operation of the Internet, and therefore beyond the control of Royal LePage, and is not to be applied in any manner contrary to applicable law or governmental regulation.

Royal LePage may disclose your personally identifiable information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (1) conform to the requirements of the law or comply with governmental orders, court orders, or legal process served on Royal LePage; (2) protect and defend the property or rights of Royal LePage.

Royal LePage reserves the right to modify this policy at any time. Changes will be posted on this page, so we encourage you to return to this page to review this policy and keep informed of any changes.
