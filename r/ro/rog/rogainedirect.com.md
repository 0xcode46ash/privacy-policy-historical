If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, we may use that information to improve our understanding of your interests and concerns as well as to improve our products and services. We may use the information to contact you about our products and services. We may send your name and address to advertising, consulting, and market research companies that work with us. We will not sell your name, address or phone number to a third party. 

**MINORS (INDIVIDUALS UNDER 18 YEARS OF AGE)**   
Pharmacia & Upjohn does not intend to collect any personally identifiable information from people under 18 years of age through this website.

**COOKIES**   
Pharmacia & Upjohn uses so-called "cookies" in order to personalize delivery of content based on a Rogaine user's experience with the product. When you enter the Rogaine.com website we will assign your computer browser a unique random number called a "cookie". 

Cookies enhance our website by allowing you faster access to the information you are seeking and by allowing us to provide suitable offers based on your experience with Rogaine. 

Your privacy and security are not compromised when you accept a cookie from our website. We do not use cookies to collect personally identifiable information. Any information you submit in the registration portion of the website will not be associated with any cookie. Cookies from our server are sent securely and cannot read data from your computer's hard disc or read cookie files from other websites. 

This website requires that you accept cookies if you wish to enter. When you are in the site and you receive a pop-up window asking permission to accept a cookie, you must answer "yes" to advance beyond that area. 

**MESSAGE BOARD AND PASSWORD**   
In order to use the "message board" function in the Community Forum section of the website, you will be asked to submit a screen name and password. This information is needed to associate your comments on the board with an anonymous entity. No personal data will be collected in this area and all comments will be posted with complete anonymity. 

Your comments on the message board will be moderated for appropriateness but no personal information will be associated with your posting. 

**LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES**  
As a resource to our visitors, Pharmacia & Upjohn may provide links to other websites. We try to carefully choose websites, which we believe are useful and meet our high standards for the accuracy and utility of information. However, because website design and content can change so quickly, we cannot guarantee the standards of every website to which we link. Likewise, we are not responsible for the content of any third-party's website. We also cannot guarantee the privacy policies of these other sites and suggest you check the privacy policies of those websites directly. 

**ACCURACY**  
Pharmacia & Upjohn will make every effort to maintain the accuracy and confidentiality of any personally identifiable information you supply to us. If you wish to make additions or other corrections to the information that you provide, please transmit them to us using the [_e-mail address_](mailto:christopher.jepson@am.pnu.com) listed in this website. 

**SECURITY**  
All information transmitted to this website is secure to the extent possible using existing technology. Unauthorized third parties should not be able to access it during transmission. We will store the information that you share with us securely and will take appropriate steps to protect it from unauthorized access or disclosure. While no security steps can guarantee 100 percent protection, we utilize state-of-the-art technology and systems to prevent unauthorized access to the information we hold. We educate our employees and representatives about their duty to protect your privacy, and provide training regarding this Privacy Policy. 

**E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS AND OPTING OUT**   
Pharmacia & Upjohn may contact you by e-mail after you register with information that we think you will find useful, including announcements about special offers and new products and services regarding Rogaine. It is our policy to send such e-mail only to customers who explicitly give us permission do so.
