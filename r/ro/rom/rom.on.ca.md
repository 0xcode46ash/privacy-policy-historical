# Privacy Statement

  
Date: May 22, 2002 

The Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) is committed to respecting the personal privacy of our website visitors. The following statement summarizes the privacy practices of the ROM’s website, informing visitors of why and how the ROM collects personal information on-line and how the ROM uses this information.

Scope: This policy applies to the ROM’s website only. We are not responsible in any way for the privacy practices of other websites, which may be linked to the ROM’s website.

  
Personal information is any information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, and includes such information as a name, a home address, home telephone number, and email address.

The ROM may collect information in a non-identifying and aggregate form to enhance our website design and to share with external groups for any ROM related business purpose. This information cannot be personally identified with a specific individual.

Personal Information  
The ROM does not automatically gather your personal information. You can anonymously access our website. Personal information is only obtained if you supply it voluntarily when using our website, i.e. contacting us via email, entering a contest, making a purchase, or registering for ROM programs or events. In general, it will be obvious when the ROM is collecting your personal information because you will have to fill out a form.

The ROM uses personal information in a limited number of ways, foremost to complete transactions, deliver the selected product or service, and to respond to questions or comments. The ROM will not sell or rent your personal information. We may share your information in the following situations:  
· To those suppliers or companies hired to deliver the ROM’s products or services, for example a shipping company that delivers a package.  
· In some instances, for example on-line registration for programs and events, visitors may be asked to submit credit card information for payment. Credit card transactions are managed by payment processing companies with whom the ROM has partnered. The ROM will not authorize these companies to use the information except for the express purpose for which it was provided.

In certain circumstances, the ROM may use your contact information to inform you of other ROM products and services. In addition, you may be provided the opportunity to be informed of the products and services of affiliated organizations and other carefully selected cultural institutions. You will have an opportunity at the time we collect the information to indicate your preference for receiving additional information from the ROM and/or affiliated organizations, and where applicable, for inclusion in information exchanges with other cultural institutions. If you do not wish to have your information used for these or other identified purposes, tell us and we will respect your wishes. The ROM will seek to require that such affiliated organizations and/or cultural organizations maintain appropriate privacy policies.

You can always change your preference for follow-up contacts or other informational mailings, or advise us of changes in your contact information by emailing us at [info@rom.on.ca](mailto:info@rom.on.ca).

All personal information you provide is protected under the Government of Ontario’s Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.Security  
The ROM employs reasonable administrative and technical measures to ensure the security of personal information. For our on-line registration service, when sensitive information is submitted, confidentiality is protected by using secure socket layer (SSL) encryption. This advanced security system encrypts data transmissions between a web browser and website, and ensures this information may only be decrypted at its intended destination. SSL works with Netscape Navigator (version 2.0 and higher) and Microsoft Internet Explorer (versions 3.0 and higher).

Children  
Children should use the ROM’s website with the approval of a parent or guardian. Where appropriate, the ROM will specifically instruct children not to submit personal information on our website.

Information collected by technology  
The nature of the Internet requires specific information to be exchanged between a web visitor/user and the ROM website. The information collected does not identify you personally and includes:  
· Your IP (Internet protocol) address, a number automatically assigned to your computer when you visit the website.   
· Your Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
· Your type of operating system (Windows, Macintosh etc.).  
· Your Web Browser (Netscape, Internet Explorer etc.).  
This information is used by the ROM as an administrative tool for identifying system problems and monitoring network traffic. The ROM does not attempt to link this information with the identity of the individual visiting our website, except when necessary to protect our service, site, website visitors, or others.

Parts of the ROM’s website use cookies. Cookies facilitate the exchange of information from your web browser to our web server.
