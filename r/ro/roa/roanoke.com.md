# Privacy policy, terms and conditions | roanoke.com

Updated Jan. 10, 2013

We’ve adopted a set of information management guidelines that serve as the basis for our customer and advertiser relationships.

We will regularly re-evaluate this policy, and we reserve the right to change these guidelines at any time. Any such changes will be posted on this page in a timely manner. Please note that roanoke.com may contain links to other websites for your convenience and information. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those sites. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.

This statement and the policies outlined here are not intended to and do not give you any contractual or other legal rights.

### How and why we collect information from users

We collect limited amounts and types of personal information from users of our sites. The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you subscribe, order, complete a survey, register for an online discussion, enter a contest or provide your email address and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.

  


### Personal information

How we collect and store user personal information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our sites without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for services or access to portions of our sites, sign up for membership, request certain features (e.g., newsletters, news updates and other products), sign up for a newspaper subscription, complete a survey or make a purchase. You may also provide information when you participate in a promotion, sweepstakes, contest or voting and polling activities or when you post comments to blogs, message boards and chat rooms and other interactive areas of our sites. We and/or our third-party partners may use this information to process and maintain your account and compile demographic statistics about our users. Please be careful and responsible whenever you are online. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose personal information on our sites, such as in message boards, chat areas or in advertising or notices you post, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of roanoke.com and this policy.

  


### Email newsletters

If you choose to receive them, roanoke.com will periodically send you email newsletters or promotional email about services offered by roanoke.com and our advertisers.

  


### Mobile messaging service

Roanoke.com uses the information collected from your interaction with our sites by Text Messaging Service (SMS) (“SMS Service”) solely for the purposes of improving the SMS Service. The information will not be provided, sold, licensed, rented, assigned or disclosed to Third Parties, except as required by law, nor will we use your phone number to initiate a call or SMS text message to you without your express prior consent. Your wireless carrier and other service providers also collect data about your SMS Service usage, and their practices are governed by their own privacy policies.

  


### Aggregate information collected

Like most websites, we also collect and aggregate information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to our visitors. For example, we may log the name of your Internet Service Provider or use “cookie” technology. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or may control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our sites. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the sites and to take advantage of most personalized services offered. Additionally we may not be able to customize the sites’ features according to your preferences.

  


### Third-party advertising companies

We use an advertising server to display ads on roanoke.com. In addition, advertisers may elect to use third-party advertising companies to serve ads onto our websites. In the course of serving these advertisements, the third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they may contain. We do not control the placement or the acceptance of cookies from domains other than roanoke.com.

We use Remarketing with Google Analytics to advertise online. Third-party vendors, including Google, show our ads on sites across the Internet. We and some third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party and third-party cookies together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on someone’s past visits to your website. To learn more about advertising targeting technology or to opt out from being tracked by participating advertising companies, visit [http://www.aboutads.info](http://www.aboutads.info/).

  


### Third-party analytic systems

Roanoke.com is currently using Google Analytics to track and analyze aggregated usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to help us administer our websites and constantly improve their quality. All data collected is owned and used by roanoke.com, and we reserve the right to publish non-personally identifiable, summary information regarding its website visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. We reserve the right to change the vendors who provide us with usage data.

  


### Credit cards

Credit card information will be provided to third parties only to provide products and services that you order. We may use the contact information you provide to contact you about your account and/or to send you necessary information directly related to the product(s) or service(s) for which you have registered. Times-World LLC maintains compliance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) for all payment card transactions that occur within the roanoke.com domain. With your permission, we may use your contact information to inform you of new features and special offers from us. We will not provide your contact information to unaffiliated third parties without your express permission. As part of the registration process, you have the option to inform us that you do not wish to receive information about other special offers and promotions.

  


### Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements

We expect our partners, advertisers and third-party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our sites may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices with terms that differ from the terms in our Privacy Policy, and that we do not control. For example, during your visit to our sites you may link to, or view as part of a frame on a page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through roanoke.com you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, websites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Roanoke.com is not responsible for such third-party content or for the actions or policies of the third parties providing such content. You should check the applicable terms of use and privacy policies of those third parties before providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

While on our sites, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before. Through features available on our sites, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. Roanoke.com does not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

  


### What we do with the information we collect

**The aggregated information we collect is used for a number of purposes including the following:**

  1. To recognize you, provide personalization and deliver more individualized content and advertising.
  2. To improve the content and design of our sites, including by allowing roanoke.com’s editors to consult with readers.
  3. To communicate with users about our sites, registration and other customer service issues, our Terms of Service and privacy policy, products and services offered by roanoke.com, the administration of sweepstakes and contests, processing of e-commerce transactions and other topics we think you might find of interest. 
  4. To conduct research surveys on behalf of Times-World LLC, its subsidiaries and affiliates.
  5. To help us understand usage of our sites, including where our users are going and how much time they are spending there.
  6. To learn more about the interests of our users, so that we can offer goods and services we believe may be of interest.
  7. To enable audit bureaus and third party advertisers to verify our claims of traffic to our sites.
  8. To help advertisers, potential advertisers or marketers assess the suitability of the sites for their ad campaigns.
  9. To allow advertising to be targeted, based on aggregated, non-personally identifiable usage information, to the users for whom such advertising is most pertinent.

### Children's privacy

The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) provides that website operators cannot knowingly collect or store personal information, even in the aggregate, from children under age 13 except as permitted by law. Roanoke.com respects the privacy of children, and does not seek children’s participation in services that require registration. We strongly recommend that parents supervise their children’s use of the Internet. We also encourage parents to instruct their children not to give out personal information in email messages or forums.
