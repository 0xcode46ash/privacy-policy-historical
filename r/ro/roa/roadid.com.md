ROAD ID'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY (written by the Owners) 

Legally, we're required to issue and adhere to a fancy legalistic privacy policy. Our philosophy on privacy, however, is far simpler than all the legal speak that our attorneys so kindly drafted (below). We, the owners of Road ID, place a great value on our own personal privacy. We believe that your personal information is just as important as our own. So, we absolutely refuse to share your personal information with any unauthorized business, organization, or individual. We promise.

ROAD ID'S COMMITMENT TO PRIVACY (written by the Attorneys)

**OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT TO YOU**

We recognize, respect, and protect the personal privacy rights of all of our customers. We realize that our customers entrust us with non-public personal information ("NPI") and it is our policy to maintain our customers' information in a confidential manner. We are committed to providing the highest level of security and privacy regarding the maintenance and use of our customer's NPI.

**CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF NON-PUBLIC PERSONAL INFORMATION**

All of the NPI we collect about you is provided by you. We restrict access to your NPI to those employees who need to view the information in order to provide to you the valuable Road ID Emergency Response System service. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with applicable standards to guard your NPI.

Of course, the purpose of your membership in the Road ID Emergency Response System is to provide your personal information to medical personnel and individuals who access your Emergency Response Profile using the Road ID serial number and pin number combination that is engraved on your Road ID interactive ID. Accordingly, we urge you to protect the security of your Emergency Response Profile and safeguard your Road ID serial number and pin number by providing that information only to persons or entities who have a legitimate need to access your Emergency Response Profile.

**SHARING INFORMATION**

Please be assured we do not sell your name and address to third parties, nor do we share your NPI with any third parties to market any product or service. If required by law, we may disclose your NPI to appropriate governmental or law enforcement authorities. In such event, we will notify you of such disclosure if we may legally do so.

**SAFEGUARDING INFORMATION**

Our commitment to preserving the security and confidentiality of your NPI applies to our former, current, and future customers. We reserve the right to modify this policy, and will provide you with a new policy statement if we make material changes to our privacy or security practices. 

**PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS**  
Road ID may, from time to time, send e-mail messages to you containing promotions for Road ID products. No more than six promotional emails will be sent to you in any calendar year. We will NEVER release your email to any third party or send you any communications on behalf of any third party. If you receive a promotional message, it is because you have become a Road ID customer by completing a Road ID purchase or registering for a Road ID contest. By completing a purchase, you agree to receive these emails. If you no longer wish to receive these emails, simply click the unsubscribe link that is contained in each email.
