# Road Scholar : Privacy Policy

| 

This is the website of Road Scholar. It is our goal to provide the best online experience possible for our visitors. At the same time, we are very sensitive to the privacy concerns of our visitors and participants alike. 

**How we protect your name, address, and email address:**

We will not sell or rent your name, address, email address or purchase history to any other person or company.

We use your name and address to send you catalogs, brochures and, once you enroll in a program, program information.

We save the email addresses of those who send them to us but will only contact individuals directly with their permission, which can be changed in the [My Account](http://www.roadscholar.org/account/myaccount.asp) section of our website. We use your email address to send you order confirmations, newsletters (if you choose to receive these), and to collect feedback on programs you have attended as well as information regarding your interests and other details which might help us alert you to programs that you might find interesting, or help us develop new programs.   
  
**How we protect your billing information:**

When you are conducting an account transaction or registering to receive the Road Scholar Enews Bulletin or paper catalogs, we always use industry-standard encryption technologies to protect your personal information. We are secured by VeriSign, the leading provider of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol encryption keys. SSL encryption electronically masks any information you send us. 

You can verify our compliance at any time by clicking on the VeriSign logo located on our registration form.

If you feel uncomfortable completing your registration via our website, please feel free to contact our registration staff toll-free: 1-800-454-5768, **New extended hours!** Now open Monday – Friday, 8 a.m. – 9 p.m. ET..

**How we use "cookies" information:**

We use a browser feature called a cookie, placed on your computer, to help with our program registration process, storing information from screen to screen to help make your visit more efficient. Cookies also help us understand what information interests you, as well as how we can make navigation through our site easier for you, by tracking your clicks through our site. This is a common technology used widely on the Internet, and will not harm your computer in any way. We do not sell or redistribute cookie-based information, and no personal information is stored in long-term cookies set by our site. 

We have carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, which will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will educate us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate around our site, responses to email, unique visitor information, and product browsing and purchasing information. The data we provide to Coremetrics does not include password or credit card information. Coremetrics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it to roadscholar.org through a secure web connection. The information and analysis will be used to assist us in better understanding your interests in our website and how to better serve those interests and provide you with more personalized program offerings. Coremetrics is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purposes or match it against any other information in its possession, except at our request it may be used with our other brand, Road Scholar. Coremetrics is required to maintain all information collected and its analysis in confidence.
