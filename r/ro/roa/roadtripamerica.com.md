******A MESSAGE FROM THE EDITORS** **—** **  
**

******RoadTrip America** ® **** debuted on February 14, 1996, but its real beginning dates to a devastating wildfire that destroyed over 200 homes in the hills above ****Pasadena, California, in October 1993\. In a great cleansing roar, the blaze consumed our home and all our earthly goods. It was the sort of event that is usually labeled a catastrophe, a tragedy, a very evil thing.

But the fire wasn't all bad. Suddenly "stuffless," we seized the opportunity to hit the road in the [Phoenix One](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603145612id_/http%3A//www.roadtripamerica.com/phoenix/imap.htm), the four-wheel-drive motorhome that "rose from the ashes." It was our chance to see America, and we set tire to pavement at the beginning of 1994, with no particular itinerary and no return date. We guessed our wanderlust might be satisfied in six months or a year at the most, but we were way off. North America is a big continent, and there's still a vast portion of it that we have yet to enjoy.

RoadTrip America® has evolved since its first appearance on the Web to become a virtual gateway to the open road. In addition to information and entertainment, the site offers [travel services](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603145612id_/http%3A//www.roadtripamerica.com/travel.htm) through a partnership with OneTravel.com and [book recommendations](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603145612id_/http%3A//www.roadtripamerica.com/read/books.htm) through Amazon.com. Your comments and suggestions are important to us. If you experience any difficulties with our partners, [please let us know](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603145612id_/http%3A//www.roadtripamerica.com/address.htm).

What's around the next bend? There's only one way to find ********out! Join us on the road and online as the adventure continues.
