### Information we May Disclose to Affiliates Within Our Family of Companies

One category of information about you is based on our direct transactions, experiences and dealings with you, such as your identification and contact information, loan or application status, loan balances, or payment history (what we refer to as “Transaction Information”). Another category of information about you is not based directly on our transactions or experiences with you, such as information about you provided by a consumer reporting agency or information about your income, assets, or liabilities that you provide in your application (“Other Information”). 

We may share Transaction Information and Other Information within the family of companies related to us by common control or ownership (our “Affiliates”), both for our everyday business purposes and in connection with products and services they might offer.

As explained below, you may also opt-out and direct us not to share Transaction Information about you with our Affiliates in connection with products or services they might offer.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we may disclose all of the information we collect about you, as described above, to select financial service providers that participate in joint marketing programs with us to jointly offer you financial products or services. The financial services providers who participate in joint marketing programs with us may include providers and administrators of insurance products, GAP products, and vehicle service contracts that we think may interest you. If we make these disclosures, we may receive compensation. 

With your consent or at your direction, we may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated automobile dealers participating in our RoadLoans program and nonaffiliated financial institutions and creditors that may be able to provide you with a financial product or service that we cannot or do not provide. If we make these disclosures, we may receive compensation. 

We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law. 

### Confidentiality and Security
