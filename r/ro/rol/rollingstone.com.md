# RollingStone.com

RollingStone.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. You **MUST** read the following **Privacy Policy**. Agreement with these policies is a condition of use of the site, whether as a registered user or a guest. Be sure to understand what information is gathered and for what purpose before entering the site. 

**Before you register with RollingStone.com**  


**Cookies:** The first time you visit RollingStone.com, we send a cookie to your browser, which may then be stored on your system. (A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site’s computers and stored on your computer’s hard drive.) This cookie is only used on future visits to determine whether you have been to the site before. This cookie does not contain any personal information and it is only used so that we can create aggregate statistics of "first time visitors" to the site. You will remain an otherwise anonymous "guest" of the site, unless you decide to register with RollingStone.com.  


**IP Address:** We use your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information.  


**Becoming a RollingStone.com registered user**   


**Children under 13:** RollingStone.com does not accept registrations from children under the age of 13 due to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). COPPA was enacted to prevent websites from collecting and/or distributing information from children without their parents' consent. In order to comply with the standards set forth in this Act, RollingStone.com will suspend site registration by children under age 13 until reliable forms of parental consent can be implemented. For more information on COPPA, please refer to the [Federal Trade Commission Website.](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/)  


**Registration:** We ask all guests of RollingStone.com to register and become registered users if they would like to access the registered users-only features of the site and/or participate in our contests. If you decide to become a registered user, we ask you to provide us with a user name of your choice (your registered user name does not need to be your birth name), a password, email address, and birth date. We will also ask for the following (optional) personal information: first name/last name, gender, and ZIP code. We ask for this information for the following reasons:   


  1. **To "personalize" your RollingStone.com experience.** For example, if we know your ZIP code, then we can let you know when certain bands are coming to your area. In addition, the personalization features of MyRS lets you keep track of favorite bands and/or movies.   

  2. **To better target our advertising.** Ad banners can be a helpful way of discovering new products and services. Your personal information can help us choose ads that are more likely to be interesting to you. If you don't like ad banners, then you can simply ignore them.   

  3. **To create aggregate reports of anonymous registered user information.** These reports help us understand broad demographic trends and support our advertising sales efforts.   

  4. **To retrieve your password.** If you forget your password, we need a way to verify who you are so that we may send your password to you.   




**We do NOT do the following with the personal information:**   


  1. We do not share your personally identifiable information with any third party for any purpose without your consent, except that we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf for activities such as analyzing data and providing marketing assistance. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for any other purposes.  

  2. We do not add you to our RollingStone.com email newsletter mailing list(s) without your consent. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list(s) by using the My Newsletters form on the RollingStone.com website.   




**After you become a RollingStone.com registered user**  


After you become a RollingStone.com registered user, we send a new cookie to your browser that contains some of the personal information that you provided to us. This enables us to recognize you when you visit RollingStone.com, so that you don't have to login with your registered user name and password each time. This also allows us to personalize the site and target ads much more efficiently.   


As a RollingStone.com registered user, you can review albums, post to message boards, enter contests, play games, and sign up for email newsletters and/or artist updates. You are also able to track your favorite artists, people and movies through the MyRS section. We keep track of your preferences and ratings in our database, so the more that we are able to understand about your tastes, the more interesting and rewarding your RollingStone.com experience will be. This information can also help you find friends on RollingStone.com that have similar likes and dislikes. You are not required to post your reviews and/or comments on the site, but if you do, please be aware that your comments will be visible to other users on RollingStone.com. In addition, by posting on the site, you are thereby consenting to the possibility of being contacted by other RollingStone.com registered users who want to share their opinions.  


**Public Profile:** The MyRS section of the site allows users to create their own [public profile](https://web.archive.org/myrs/default.asp). We do not display any of your personal information on your public profile page or anywhere else on the site without your explicit consent. Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personal information on your public profile page, this information could be collected and used by other users without your or RollingStone.com’s permission and may result in unsolicited messages from other parties.   


**Message Boards/Chat:** As a RollingStone.com registered user, you may also choose to interact with other registered users by participating in message boards and/or chat. Users are solely responsible for anything contained in their message board/chat sessions. We do not verify, endorse or otherwise vouch for the contents of any message board/chat session. Users may be held legally liable for the contents of their message board posts/chat sessions if those posts violate any law. Users are advised that message board posts/chat sessions on our site are not "private" and may be disclosed to legal authorities under certain circumstances. We reserve the right to release current or past member information in the event that we believe that a user is in violation of the [Boards Guidelines](https://web.archive.org/boards/info.asp) or committing unlawful acts, or if the information is subpoenaed, or when we deem it necessary or appropriate. Repeat offenders of the RollingStone.com Boards Guidelines will be denied access to our site.   


No community is perfect, but we feel that a thriving community should be full of unique voices. We encourage our registered users to contribute, interact, debate, and freely express themselves on RollingStone.com in accordance with our Boards Guidelines. RollingStone.com cannot and will not constantly monitor all activity on the site. However, we will take appropriate steps against anyone violating the Boards Guidelines, respond to complaints by users and, if necessary, ban violators from the site.  


**Third party commerce partners:** As a RollingStone.com registered user, you may also purchase CDs, digital music, tickets, or merchandise through one of our commerce partners. Please note that information you provide in connection with merchandise you purchase through one of RollingStone.com commerce partners may be shared with RollingStone.com. This information is used only to enhance your RollingStone.com experience by further personalizing your registered user profile. Your personal information and credit card information will never be transferred between any commerce partners. Be advised that the RollingStone.com privacy policy does not apply to any of our commerce partners or Rolling Stone Radio (each of which has its own privacy policy.) For your protection, before providing personal information at any website, you may wish to read and understand their privacy policy.  


**Advertisements:** We use an outside ad serving company to display most of the advertisements on our site. These ads may contain cookies. RollingStone.com does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be placed by the third-party ad servers or ad networks. However, most Internet browsers allow you to control the kind of cookies you automatically accept or whether you accept cookies at all. (See your Internet browser’s instructions for information on disabling cookies.) RollingStone.com is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the RollingStone.com Web site, including those of our advertisers.  


**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  


RollingStone.com may amend this policy from time to time to reflect company and customer feedback. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how RollingStone.com is protecting your information.
