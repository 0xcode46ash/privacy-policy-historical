NOTE TO PARENTS

**

Hasbro has developed its Web site to be an enjoyable experience for children (and adults) of all ages. Hasbro recognizes that some younger children may not understand some of the information contained on the Web site or how the site operates. That is the purpose of the Privacy Statement. Please discuss this statement with your children so that they will better understand how to use the site and the information they may be asked to provide. Hasbro strongly believes that providing its visitors with accurate and adequate notice about the Web site will lead to informed choices and decisions about how to use the site, as well as protecting its users' privacy. If you have any questions or comments about the Hasbro Web site, please feel free to contact us at [consumer_support@hasbro.com](mailto:consumer_support@hasbro.com). 

It is Hasbro's policy not to collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 without first obtaining a parent or guardian's verifiable permission. If a visitor indicates that he/she is under the age of 13, he/she will be asked to print out a permission form from the site which must be signed and returned by the visitor's parent or guardian before Hasbro will accept information from that visitor. Furthermore, Hasbro will not collect personally identifiable information from children over 12 and under 18 without notifying a parent or guardian via email.
