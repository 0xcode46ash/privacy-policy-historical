# Privacy Policy - Robin

Last updated August 13, 2014

Welcome to Robin. You've arrived either via https://robinpowered.com (the "Site") or the Robin platform (the "Platform"). To keep things simple, we'll call the two of these the "Service" throughout this policy. This Privacy Policy explains Robin’s policy for personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) and other information we collect from both users and visitors to the Service.

The Service is owned and operated by Robin Powered, Inc. (“Robin”, “we,” “our” or “us”). Before we start, you should know that we take privacy seriously, especially when it comes to data you provide us. Our business is enabling better workplaces, not selling user data you’ve trusted us with. That being said, there are certain ways that we’ll use your Personal Data which this policy explains in detail.

We’ve done our best to write this in clear language for humans. If any part of this privacy policy is unclear, we're happy to guide you: [privacy@robinpowered.com](mailto:privacy@robinpowered.com)

* * *

This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect through the any version of the Service. It governs how we receive and handle information.

This privacy policy doesn't apply to:

  * Data collection that happens offline or outside of our Service (unless otherwise stated below).

  * The data practices of third parties who may interact with our Service.




To get the full picture, you should also review:

  * Our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms "Full terms for Robin usage")

  * Your Service Agreement. If you're a registered user of the Service, this document has a few extra terms that may apply to you.




_By using our Service, you consent to our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use. You also consent to our collection, use and sharing of your information, data, and other activities, as described below._

* * *

### What information do we collect?

#### Information you give us

**Personal Data**. As you use the Service, we may ask you for personally identifiable information like your name or email address. We'll call this "Personal Information". We may collect Personal Information through forms and other interactions on the Service. This includes places like account registration, contact forms, account profile, and "personas".

#### Information collected as you use the Service

We automatically collect and store information when you interact with the Service ("Usage Information"). By default we limit Usage Information access to Robin and its third party service providers (e.g. hosting). If you've approved access for any third parties, we'll also share with them.

We store and access Usage Information using a few technologies downloaded to your device. This happens whenever you interact with our Service. In our world, a "Device" may be your personal computer, browser, tablet, mobile phone, or wearable. Usage Information associated with Personal Information provided via the Service becomes Personal Information too.

Usage Information includes things like:

  * Details about your activities at a Robin location, limited to what you approved upon arrival.

  * Ways to identify your device. Your IP address, UUID, or other unique identifier ("Device Identifier"). A Device Identifier is a string that Robin automatically assigns to your Device to access the Service.

  * Your Device functionality (e.g. browser, operating system, hardware, and mobile network).

  * How you found the Service (e.g. referring website)

  * Your activity in the Service. So we can do things like remember you and your preferences.

  * Your Device's location.

  * General information about your Device (e.g. characteristics, time of day, etc.).




#### Tracking Technology

We or our vendors may use a few methods to store or collect Usage Information ("Tracking Technologies"). Tracking Technologies may set and change settings on your Device.

One of the ways we do this is through "cookies". A cookie is a small files our Service gives your Device when it's accessed. We use cookies to enable functionality, improve Service usage analytics, and market the service. For example, a cookie allows us to keep you logged in during a session rather than asking for a password at every action. Another example is as a security measure to prevent fraudulent activity with your accounts. You can disable cookies on your Device, but parts of the Service may not be functional without them.

We and our vendors may also use tools like web beacons ("clear gifs"), scripts, and images to help manage site content and usage.

These technologies help us understand the performance and usefulness of content in the Service. We use these insights to improve the content, products or services offered through the Service.

Tracking Technologies used by our service providers are not covered by this policy. We don't have control over them, but do screen to make sure they have acceptable policies before integrating.

##### Tracking Consent

We get your consent to our storage and collection Tracking Technologies in a few ways:

  * Giving you transparent information in this Privacy Policy

  * Allowing you to choose to third parties access to your data

  * Giving you the opportunity to choose to disable cookies.




**FYI:** We are not required to get consent for Tracking Technology that's strictly necessary to the Service. For example, using cookies as a way to improve security through fraud prevention.

##### Third Party Tracking

Robin may use other Tracking Technologies (some which may not exist yet) in connection with the Service in the future.

Third parties (including vendors) may also use Tracking Technologies in connection with our Service. They may collect information about your online activities across third party websites or services. We may not control those Tracking Technologies and we are not responsible for them. You consent to encountering third party Tracking Technologies as you use our Service. You also accept that our Privacy Policy does not apply to Tracking Technologies or practices of third parties.

##### "Do Not Track"

Some third parties have ways (e.g. Browser do-not-track signals) for users to control how online services collect their information. We don't currently take any action based on these signals, however this may change in the future.

#### Information third parties provide about you

We may combine information collected directly from you on our Service with third party records. This information allows us to give you a better experience by customizing content and opportunities to you. Unless disclosed otherwise, combined information becomes Personal Information and this Privacy Policy will apply.

Aside from the above, this Privacy Policy does not apply to information we receive about you from third parties. This includes if they have used our technology to collect and share information with us.

#### Interactions with third party services

Parts of the Service may include certain interactions with third-party websites or applications. This functionality may involve the third-party operator giving us certain information, including Personal Information. When you register with the Service for example, you may have an option to link your account to a third party account (e.g. Google) to help the registration, log in and transaction process. or otherwise. If we offer and you choose to use this functionality in our Service, the third-party may send your Personal Information to us. We will treat it as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy because we collect it as a result of you using our Service.

We may also provide third-party sites' interfaces or links in the Service to help you send communications. For example, a share button for emailing links via the Service. These third parties may keep information used or provided in communications or other activities. These third parties' practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. Robin may not control or have access to your communications through these third parties.

When you use third party services, they are responsible for their practices. We can only vouch for our services and policies, and cannot be responsible for their practices. Be sure to review third-party policies before using their tools on our Service.

#### How we handle payments

We use vetted third party vendors for credit card transactions and billing when you register to use the Service. All credit card transactions are handled separately through their servers. They don't share complete financial account information with Robin. You can find our current vendor's privacy policy here: <https://stripe.com/us/privacy>.

### How do we use information we collect?

Third-party analytics services providers such as Google Analytics and other service providers may set and access their own Tracking Technologies on your Device and they may otherwise collect or have access to information about you, potentially including Personal Information, about you.

The Service may contain content that is supplied by a third party, and those third parties may collect Usage Information and your Device Identifier when pages from the Service are served to you. In addition, when you are on the Service you may be directed to other services that are operated and controlled by third parties that we do not control. We are not responsible for the data collection and privacy practices employed by any of these third parties or their services and they may be tracking you across multiple sites and may be sharing the results of that tracking with us and/or others.
