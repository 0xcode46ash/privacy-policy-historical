# Privacy Policy

It is the policy of Robins Federal Credit Union (RFCU) to hold member information in confidence, subject to applicable legal requirements. RFCU will not sell member information for use to a non-affiliated third party.  
To protect member privacy RFCU controls the way any information about members is shared with vendors. If any of our vendors require to use member information in order to provide services to members, we require the vendor to provide us with a confidentially agreement. A member may request to be excluded from receiving credit union materials, and or marketing materials from third party vendors, by submitting your request in writing to: 

**Robins Federal Credit Union  
P.O.Box 6849  
Warner Robins, GA 31095-6849**

**E-Mail:** Information contained in e-mail sent by members and non-members may be used by the staff to answer questions, to follow-up on suggestions or complaints, or to improve service at RFCU. The most important issue you must be advised on is e-mail may not be secure against interception by unauthorized individuals. Therefore, if you wish to communicate sensitive or personal information, you may want to send it by postal mail.
