## Frequently Asked Questions

Before you contact us, please be sure to read this FAQ first   
Thank you 

* * *

Q: You have a lot of information about the domain i am looking for, where do you get it? A:The data is publicly available collected from many sources. The domain information is fetched via normal DNS lookups, just as your browser does when you visit a site. Network information is fetched from publicly available BGP feeds and other info is collected from third parties such as [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/), [Sedo](http://www.sedo.com/), [radb](http://www.radb.net/) and other places. We can not change any information listed, you will have to go to the corresponding source.  Q: I found that my webpage is hosted on a server with pornographic or other explicit contents, need I worry? A:Yes, sometimes an IP like that gets blocked in some filters, meaning that all sites on the IP get effectively blocked. It is also said that it could affect your ranking in search engines.   
You would probably want to ask your hosting company to move you, or the other site, to a clean IP number.  Q: I am somehow listed on any of the blacklist, please unlist me A: We can not unlist you from any of these RBL:s. None of them are under our control. Please contact the managers of the list, and start by reading the information on their sites, they normally provide information on how to get unlisted.  Q: I see some strange DNS records that shouldn't exist for a domain A:Most likely you see what is called a [wildcard dns record](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record), meaning that whatever you type in front of a dns name gives the same result. For instance, you can go to <http://blablablabla.usgov.com/> in your browser and it works (via a redirect). It does not mean that usgov.com has entered a record for blablablabla, but they have a wildcard record that matches **anything**. Wildcard records are generally a bad idea, since you let others make up hostnames themselves, and after a while you do not know which names are used and which are not. Of course this confuses our systems as well. We are trying to filter those records, but at the same time it would be bad to filter i.e. www in the cases that was a wildcard and not a real record. For now our systems at least detects most wildcards, on the information page for [blablablabla.usgov.com](https://web.archive.org/dns/blablablabla.usgov.com.html#records) you can see the *.usgov.com record, which is the wildcard record.  Q: I am trying to locate the person behind a website, please help A: We are glad you used our service, but we can not help you further if you do not find it there. Through our services you can find a lot of information about the hostname and who to contact, and we do not have more information than we display.  Q: Why is "example.com" on my credit card bill, I haven't bought anything from them A:Either you have actually bought something from them or a related site and forgot, or, more likely: it's some kind of fraud. Check the domain on the tool, especially the whois and related tab, to find out as much as possible about who hosts the site, and then contact your bank and possibly the police. I guess there is no guarantee that a name on your credit card bill has anything to do with the corresponding domain. FBI has some good information about [Internet Frauds](http://www.fbi.gov/majcases/fraud/internetschemes.htm). And there is also [Internet Crime Complaint Center](http://www.ic3.gov/complaint/default.aspx) which I guess could help you.  Q: You have information about a specific IP that is attacking or sending spam to me, please help me make it stop. A:We are glad you found the service useful, but we can not help it stop. Through our services you can find a lot of information about the IP and who to blame.  Q: How you are able to find the shared domains associated with a particular search domain in your DNS lookup tools? A:All domain information is gathered with normal dns-lookups, exactly as a normal web browser or mail server does. The information returned is cached and refreshed when needed. From that information selections are made matching a special criteria from the cache, such as similarity with respect to name server or ip number.  Q: Your site is very helpful, but the information seems to be wrong A:The primary information on a hostname should be automatically refreshed, if the ip of a name server or mail server is outdated, you can see how old it is under the name, and simply by clicking on it it will take you to the corresponding url and refresh the data. We try to update network information and AS-number information weekly, you can see when it was last generated on any page describing the AS-number. The names of AS-numbers and some other information is updated via [radb.net](http://www.radb.net/), so make sure your information is correctly registered there. You can get it listed via any of the registries they mirror, such as [altdb.net](http://www.altdb.net/) Q: I try to send mail someone but the mail bounces, can you help A:No, you can use the site to see if your mail server is listed in RBL, or who handles the mail server, and contact them or your own mail administrator. If that does not help, please contact an Internet consultant.  Q: I want to protect my whois information, any idea how to do it? A:We have found <http://www.whoisguard.com/> and <http://www.active-domain.com/whois-proof.htm> offers that service. Looks like they do the job.   
These days most registrars offer that service, so check with your registrar first.  Q: Do you provide access to a public or commercial API? A:We do not offer a public API service at this point in time. However, we are always eager to meet the demands of our customers, and will look into providing such services in the future. In order for us to provide an API that matches the overall quality of robtex.com, exceptional care and effort must be applied. The bottleneck is not time nor code compatibility, but rather a sense of perfectionism. We simply will not allow ourselves to release anything that is not perfectly optimized to our customer's needs. This is where you, our customers, play a vital role, as we rely on feedback in order to design and implement the API features you want.  Q: I want to help robtex.com design an API, by providing valuable feedback A:Excellent! We really appreciate it. What would you like to see in a robtex.com API? What would be a fair balance point between a public (and possibly free) API, and a premium solution, when it comes to features? Please share your thoughts with us via email or by interacting with us on Google+. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.  Q: I have a question not answered above A:

If you want to get in touch with someone behind a domain or IP-number, try the "contact" and "whois" - tab on the corresponding information-page. However if you have questions about this lookup tool, please ask us at [info@robtex.com](mailto:info@robtex.com?Subject=I%20have%20read%20the%20FAQ)
