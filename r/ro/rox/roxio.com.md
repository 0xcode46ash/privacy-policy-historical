**Methods of Information Collection and Usage:**

  * Product Registration and On-line Support Requests



In order to improve our problem resolution process through better product and case tracking, Roxio's tech support department has implemented online product registration and technical support service. We require contact information and either product serial number or TSID number to identify your product. This information is used to manage your case, notify you when necessary of issues related to your product and, together with your voluntary responses to our marketing survey, it is used to analyze our customer base in aggregate. Occasionally, we may send emails to give customers information we think you will find useful, such as information about new features, products or promotions. When we ema il you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe so you will not receive our emails in the future. You may also opt-out of receiving future Roxio and/or partner communications by submitting your request through our on-line Feedback form.

**Sweepstakes, Contests & Promotions:** Roxio occasionally sponsors sweepstakes, contests and promotions. We use contact data from our promotions to send users information we think you will find useful, such as information about new products or promotions. When we email you, we will always provide instructions explaining how to unsubscribe, so you will not receive our emails in the future.

**Online Store:** To process your order we require name, billing address, phone number, email address, shipping address and credit card information. We use this information to process your order and, if any questions arise, to contact you about your order. In general, we will try to contact you first by email and only if that fails, or if time is critical, will we try to contact you by phone. Your order is processed, on our behalf, by Yahoo, a provider of e-commerce services. View [Yahoo!'s Privacy Policy](http://privacy.yahoo.com/privacy/us/).

**Online Surveys:** Our online surveys ask visitors for contact information (like email address). This may be used to contact you if additional follow-up is appropriate, but will not be used for future marketing purposes, unless explicitly stated.

**Email Newsletters:** Roxio distributes various product- or topic-specific newsletters. We require first name and last name, so that we may personalize your greeting, email address and in some cases your country, as not all offers are valid in all countries. Typically all other contact information is voluntary and may be used to send other information or offers via mail. We do not share your information with third parties, except as required to deliver our message. Here is a list of existing email newsletters. Follow the link to subscribe and/or unsubscribe.
