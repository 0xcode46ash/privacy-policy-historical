  1. **1.        What is Personal Information?**



“Personal Information” or “Personal data” means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (each a ‘data subject’). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or by one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

Personal Information may include name; address; email address; phone number; IP address; location data; payment details; information about movements around our websites and other digital media such as mobile app or social media; information concerning your interests; bookings; purchases and product and service preferences; data captured in authentication and tracking logs; and information collected from cookies and similar technologies.

  1. **2.       What personal information might we collect about you?**



We may process the following personal data about you:

Information you give us. You may give us information about you by, even partially, filling in forms, setting up a user account or profile, subscribing to newsletters and other services, making or cancelling a booking or ordering a product, making applications in respect of job postings, uploading information on our website, putting in an "enquiry" about one of our hotels or resorts, using our enquiry form or participating in one of our on-line surveys, participating in prize draws or promotions or by communicating with us by e-mail, phone or otherwise, e.g. by calling one of our Reservation Offices (or third party office) or by contacting a particular hotel or resort directly. This information may include your name, email address, billing address, room preferences or special requests, phone number, guarantee and deposit information to secure your reservation, the content of any email you send to us and any other similar information. You are under no obligation to provide this information, but without it, we may not be able to provide you with some of our content, services or information you may request.

Information collected during your stay with us. We record your itemised spending and other expenses billed to your room. Information particular to your stay may also be stored (i.e. health issues, payment difficulties, special requests, service issues). The information specific to your stay is stored in the property management systems and is combined with information from previous visits that you have made to that hotel or to any other hotels within the group. Certain information regarding your service preferences is also stored centrally by us and may be made available to other Rocco Forte Hotels properties. In addition, we may retain the content of any document (including letters, comment cards, electronic documents such as e-mails and other similar forms of communication) that you send to us before, during or following your stay. 

Information we collect about you. With regard to each of your visits to our website or app we may collect:

  * information that does not reveal your personal identity, for example, the type of destination you are seeking information on. We use this aggregated data mainly for editorial purposes, and we may connect it to any Personal Information, such as your name or address.
  * technical information, including the Internet protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your login information, browser type and version, time zone setting, date and time you access our website, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our website, browser plug-in types and versions, operating system and platform and similar information; and

We may collect personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18 as part of the guest reservation and registration processes, but always with the consent of such person’s parent or guardian.

Information obtained from someone making a booking on your behalf. If you are entering data on behalf of another person, you warrant to us that you are authorised by that person to enter their personal data into our system, and that information you enter is accurate and correct. If any non-compliance by you with respect to this provision results in any loss or damage being incurred by us, you may be required to compensate us in respect of such loss.

Information about you obtained from third party sources. These third party sources may include credit reference agencies and other third parties. In addition, in preparation for your stay, we may collect your photograph from publically available sources so that we can recognise you in order to provide you with outstanding customer service.

We use the following cookies on our website. We may combine information from these types of cookies and technologies with information about you from any other source.

Strictly necessary cookies. These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our website and use its features. Without these cookies, services you have asked for cannot be provided. They are deleted when you close the browser. These are first party cookies.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website (including your IP address) will be transmitted to and stored by third party analytics service providers on servers outside EEA. The information collected for this purpose (including your IP address and other information collected by automated means) will be disclosed to or collected directly by these service providers. On our behalf third party analytics service providers will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity and providing other services relating to website activity and internet activity in connection with the use of the website. These service providers may retain and use anonymised, aggregated data collected from users of our Website in connection with their own businesses, including in order to improve their products and services.

As a result, you may see certain third party ads on other websites based on your visits to our website because we participate in advertising networks administered by third-party vendors, such as Google Adwords, Bing Ads, Yandex, Yahoo, Baidu, Facebook, and other similar service providers. In addition, these ad networks allow us to target our ads to our users considering demographic, users' inferred interests and browsing context. These networks track your online activities over time by collecting information through automated means, including through the use of cookies, web server logs and web beacons. The networks use this information to show you ads that are tailored to your individual interests, to track your browser activity across multiple websites, and to build a profile of your web browsing. The information our ad network vendors collect includes information about your visits to websites that participate in the vendors' advertising networks, such as the pages or advertisements you view and the actions you take on the websites. This data collection takes place both on our website and on third-party websites that participate in the ad networks. This process also helps us track the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. Further, we may use features of third party analytics service providers for display advertisers. That includes obtaining specific visitor cookie data, such as the source, medium and keywords used to visit our website.

  1. **7.       How is my Personal Information secured?**



We endeavour to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information that we hold in our records. Unfortunately, we cannot always guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failures, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information.  Also, while we endeavour to put adequate contractual protections in place we cannot guarantee the security of any Personal Information in databases hosted by third parties.

Each Rocco Forte Hotels property stores Personal Information in a secure location, be it a database, PMS, marketing and research database or a filing cabinet. Furthermore, we take steps to ensure that only designated individuals have access to this information. In addition, due to the personal nature of the information you provide when making a reservation through our website or mobile Apps, Rocco Forte Hotels employs encryption technology to keep your data secure. In relation to sharing, Personal Information obtained by Rocco Forte Hotels or third party Reservation offices will be sent in a secured communication to the relevant hotel or resort.

When you log-in to complete or modify a Booking Profile or a Guest Service Profile, your online interaction with us is protected from eavesdropping using the highest level encryption technology based on the browser you use. In order to ensure your privacy and the protection of information you choose to share with us, we allow only encrypted communications from all of our web forms.

Credit card information is transmitted and stored in encrypted format and only unencrypted when required for taking payments or guaranteeing future stays. Access to unencrypted credit card details is restricted to designated individuals as per PCI DSS industry best practise.

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, which encrypts information you input and which is certified by the Secure Server Certification Authority. We reveal only the last four digits of your credit card numbers when confirming a reservation or processing on-line purchase transactions. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company for verification or during payment. It is important for you to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when you have finished using a shared computer.

We recommend that you do not include any confidential information (i.e. credit card information) when using e-mail. For your protection, our e-mail responses to you will not include any confidential information.

Finally, to be prudent, please be sure to always close your browsers when you are done using a form or the reservation site. Although the session will terminate after a short period of inactivity, it is best to close your browsers immediately upon completion.

  1. **8.       Is my Personal Information transferred overseas?**

These reasons include: the purpose of entering into or fulfilling a contract with you, reserving a room, processing on-line purchase transactions, replying to or taking actions in response to your enquiries or requests, for processing by us or on behalf of the hotels and residences properties managed by us, enhancing personalization of services provided to you, communicating news and promotions to you relating to Rocco Forte Hotels related products and services and other products and services we think may be of interest to you, and statistical and analysis purposes. Our core business systems, including property management systems, are located in data centres within EEA or US or Russia. 

Such transfer of data may be to a country which may not provide the same level of privacy protection as that provided by the country in which the information was collected. However, we will take reasonable steps (including entering into data transfer agreements based on the European Commission model clauses, where required) to ensure that your data is adequately protected by using appropriate technical, organisation, contractual or other lawful means. If you are located in the European Economic Area or the UK, you may contact us for a copy of the safeguards which we have put in place to protect your personal data and privacy rights in these circumstances.
