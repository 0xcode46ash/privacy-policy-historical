Arvato Digital Services' Rockstar Games Online Store

Privacy Statement

Last updated: August 24, 2011 

This privacy statement explains the information collection, use and disclosure practices of Arvato Digital Services' Rockstar Games Online Store Program (the " **Site** ") operated by Arvato Digital Services LLC (" **Arvato** ", " **we** " or " **us** "), an official reseller and merchant of record of the products offered on the Site. The terms "official reseller" and "merchant of record" mean that transactions on the Site occur between you and Arvato. Arvato collects and processes your financial information to conduct these transactions, while Rockstar Games separately collects non-financial information about your transaction, such as what digital games you have purchased. This Privacy Policy applies solely to this Site, and not to any other Web site, product or service. Rockstar Games is not a party to this Privacy Policy. Please consult the Rockstar Games Privacy Policy <http://www.rockstargames.com/privacy/> for details about their collection of data on the Site. Each time you access the Site, you are consenting to the information collection, use, disclosure and transfer practices described in this privacy statement. 

We may occasionally update this privacy statement. When we do, we will also revise the "last updated" date at the top of the privacy statement. For material changes to this privacy statement, we will notify you either by placing a prominent notice on the home page of the Site or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this privacy statement to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. Each time you use the Site, you are agreeing to the then-current privacy statement, including any updates. 

The Site will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you (for example, information that allows us to contact you). 

The purposes for which the personal information will be collected, used and disclosed (the "Purposes") are as identified in this privacy statement - in particular under the headings "Collection of Your Personal Information", "Use of Your Personal Information" and "Disclosure of Your Personal Information" - or as identified at the point the information is collected from you, except to the extent otherwise permitted or required by law. 

The personal information the Site collects will include name, e-mail address, phone, and postal address, and, if there is a charge associated with your order, credit card information. The Site may also collect certain non-personal information about your visit, such as the name of the Internet service provider and the Internet Protocol (IP) address through which you access the Internet; the date and time you access the Site; the pages that you access while at the Site and the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Site. Non-personal information is used for the operation and improvement of the Site and may be shared with third parties. 

The Purposes will include: use of the personal information by us to operate the Site, and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized, and for such other purposes as may be required or permitted by law. In support of these uses, we may use and disclose personal information to troubleshoot your order and to provide you with more effective customer service. 

Arvato occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as Web site hosting, payment processing and related operational services. We will only transfer to those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose. 

You acknowledge and agree that personal information collected on the Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Arvato or its affiliates, subsidiaries, provider or agents maintain facilities, and while in such jurisdiction may be subject to access pursuant to the laws of such jurisdiction. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) we may disclose and transfer such information to one or more third parties who acquire all or a substantial portion of our business, whether such acquisition is by way of merger, consolidation, purchase of all or a substantial portion of our assets or shares, or otherwise, (b) in the event Arvato becomes the subject of an insolvency proceeding or its equivalent, whether voluntary or involuntary, Arvato or its trustee, administrator, receiver, administrative receiver or equivalent may sell, license or otherwise dispose of such information in connection with that proceeding and (c) we may disclose and transfer such information to investigate suspected fraud, breach of the Site terms of use or a violation of applicable law. 

As discussed above, Arvato is an "official reseller" and the "merchant of record" which means that transactions on the Site occur between you and Arvato. Rockstar Games separately collects non-financial information about your transaction, such as what digital games you have purchased, and that collection is subject to the Rockstar Games Privacy Policy. Except as otherwise described in the Purposes or in this paragraph, personal information you provide on the Site will not be disclosed outside of Arvato without your consent. 

You can access and edit the personal information you provided to Arvato on this Site by submitting a request through http://support.rockstargames.com/tickets/new. 

We endeavor to protect the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer servers with limited access that are located in controlled facilities. Additionally, when we transmit sensitive personal information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. However, we cannot guaranty that unauthorized access will never occur, and you assume such risk when using the Site. 

We may use cookies on this Site to ensure the integrity of the purchasing process and to personalize the Site. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of this or other web sites you visit. 

Some of our web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our Site and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services, as well as to determine whether promotional e-mail messages have been opened and acted upon. We may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile statistics and determine the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns. We do not permit Web beacons on the Site to be used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. 

We do not deliberately gather or request information about children under the age of 13, unless the child's parent or guardian provides explicit consent. 

The Site may contain links to other websites, and other websites may contain links to the Site. We are not responsible for the privacy or data protection policies or practices of such other websites, and we recommend that you inform yourself about the privacy or data protection policies of such other websites before providing any information on those other websites. 

This Privacy Policy is subject to, and incorporated into, the Site terms of use. 

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about this Privacy Statement, please contact us by submitting a request to http://support.rockstargames.com/tickets/new or via postal mail at the address provided below.
