Children

The Museum web site is not intended for children under the age of 13 and the Museum does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years old through its website. Anyone under 18 years old should seek his or her parent’s or guardian’s permission prior to using or disclosing any information on this site. The Museum believes that parents should supervise their children's online activities and should consider using parental control tools available from online services and software manufacturers that help provide a safe online environment for children to work within. These tools can also prevent children from disclosing personal information without parental permission. For additional information about parental control tools, please consult the "Consumer Assistance" page of the Direct Marketing Association home page which can be found at www.the-dma.org. If the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with any information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files. If the Museum obtains knowledge from any source that it has information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files.

Non-Personal Information

The Museum or its representatives, agents and/or service providers may collect Non-Personal Information about the visitors to our website. Non-Personal Information includes anonymous information collected through use of technologies such as “cookies,” “spotlight tags” and “web beacons.” In using these technologies, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, and the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to and from our website (including date and time). The information collected by the use of these technologies is anonymous and is not linked with the Personal Information you provide to the Museum.

Non-Personal Information may be used by the Museum or its representatives, agents and/or service providers to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to perform statistical analyses that are used to measure interest in various areas of our site (or the sites of our representatives, agents and/or service providers) to help determine the usefulness of various products and services, and to generate advertising related to the clickstream of an IP address. Using Non-Personal Information, we (or our representatives, agents or service providers) may also compile and provide aggregate statistics about the use of our (or their) website(s), visitors, customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties. These statistics will not include any Personal Information.

With Whom Do We Share Your Information?

Personal Information and Purchase Information  
The Museum may share Personal Information, including Purchase Information, with certain third parties such as our agents, service providers and other representatives acting on our behalf.  For example, we may share Personal Information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as:

  *     delivering packages;
  *     registration for and participation in educational programs;
  *     order fulfillment;
  *     maintaining our membership program;
  *     conducting research and analysis;
  *     processing credit card payments;
  *     offering you products or services which may be of interest to you, some of the proceeds of which may support the Museum;
  *     sending Museum marketing communications; or
  *     conducting other business activities as needed. 



 The third parties with whom we conduct business are authorized to use your Personal Information only to perform the service for which they are hired, and they are required to take reasonable measures to ensure your Personal Information is secure.

On occasion, we contract with trusted third party providers who may receive your Personal Information and conduct anonymized aggregate analyses of the data.  We require our contracting partners to maintain adequate security of Personal Information provided to them, and we do not permit such third party providers to sell your Personal Information to other parties.

Promotional Packages and Educational Programs

When you register for a promotional package (for example, a ticket package that offers you admission to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for one price) or educational program (for example, a seminar for which teachers can obtain credit through an academic institution), your Personal Information, including your purchase information, may be shared with the businesses or educational institutions identified by name in the promotional package or educational program materials. This is required to complete your reservation or registration in the promotional package or educational program. We cannot be responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by these third parties. For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties before disclosing any personal information to or through them.

Nonprofit Cultural Institutions

We reserve the right to share your Personal Information, but not your Purchase Information, with other nonprofit cultural institutions in the greater Cleveland area. If you do not want to have your information used in this way, you may send an e-mail message containing your name and postal address to donotshare@rockhall.org.

In the event that the Museum enters into a business transition, such as a merger with or an acquisition by another company, or a sale of a portion of or all of its assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets that are transferred or disclosed in connection with such a transaction.

From time to time, we may be required to share Personal Information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may share certain Personal Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of others and ourselves.
