The information you supply in connection with your purchase is, however, forwarded to the Museum and is then subject to the terms of this privacy policy. 

**Museum Service Providers.** Sometimes third party service providers (such as Shamrock, above) are retained or utilized by the Museum and may have access to our visitor’s Personal Information.  In some cases such third parties may have been requested to maintain the confidentiality of, and not use, Personal Information for any purposes other than providing services to the Museum, but the Museum has no means to police the activities of those service providers with their use of information disclosed to them. 

## 4.  COOKIES AND IP ADDRESSES

**Cookies.** Cookies are small text files or pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual’s hard drive for record-keeping purposes.  The cookie assigns you an ID, which allows the host to recognize you when you return to that Site.  This helps the host understand which areas of the Site are most popular and enables the host to enhance the Site. The Museum currently does not utilize cookies, but may do so in the future. 

**How can I disable cookies?** Site visitors usually have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences.  Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies.  Normally you can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.  However, some parts of Site may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. 

**Use of IP Addresses.** An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.  When visitors request pages from the Site, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses.  We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means the visitor remains anonymous to us.  The Museum collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration and to audit the frequency of use of this Site. 

## 5.  LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES

During your visit to this Site, you may come across links that will take you to third party web sites.  These third party web sites are not subject to the Museum’s Privacy Policy. Therefore, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of these web sites before you disclose your Personal Information to these other parties. 

## 6.  SECURITY

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.  The Museum strives to protect your Personal Information but cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.  **The Museum is not liable for disclosures of Personal Information due to errors in transmission or unauthorized acts of third parties.** However, once we receive Personal Information, we do our best to ensure its security by making reasonable efforts to protect the information.
