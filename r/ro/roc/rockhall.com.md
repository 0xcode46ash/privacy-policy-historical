## Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc. (the “Museum") website.  This Privacy Policy is intended to describe how the Museum handles information that you provide or that we learn about the individuals who visit our websites or contact us by mail, email or telephone or in person, or who provide us with information through any other means.  We recommend that you carefully review this policy before providing us with any information.  By accessing and using this site you agree to this Privacy Policy and our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms "Terms of Use"). 

This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected by The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, Inc., the websites the Museum operates under the domain located at [www.rockhall.com](http://www.rockhall.com/ "www.rockhall.com"), and other physical or online locations where the Museum may collect information.  This privacy policy does not apply to any information collected at or associated with the Hall of Fame induction process, any annexes or off-site or traveling exhibits, or the Museum Shop located at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum. 

## What Information does the Museum Collect and How is it Used? 

This section is intended to provide you with explanation regarding what information the Museum may collect from or about individuals who visit our websites or contact us by mail, e-mail, telephone or in person, or who provide us with information through any other means, and how that information may be used. 

**Personal Information**   
The Museum will only collect Personal Information that you voluntarily provide to us or our service providers.  The Personal Information we may collect includes, among other things, your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address (which may be required, for example, for a transaction) or date of birth (this kind of information would be voluntary on your part, but would assist the Museum in understanding the demographics of persons interested in Museum services).  You may be requested to provide Personal Information when you choose to engage in the following activities:   


  * purchase a membership;
  * purchase a product or service; 
  * request information; 
  * make a donation; 
  * participate in a survey; 
  * register for educational programs, activities, or ticket packages; 
  * enter into a contest or sweepstakes; 
  * apply for employment, internship or other volunteer opportunities; 
  * subscribe to one of our newsletters; or
  * participate in other activities offered by the Museum that require your Personal Information. 



Once you provide your Personal Information, we may use it for purposes including, but not limited to: 

  * managing our membership program; 
  * fulfilling requests for products, services, group ticket sales, facility rental, or other information; 
  * tracking and confirming orders; 
  * providing customer services; 
  * administering sweepstakes, promotions, or surveys; 
  * improving the effectiveness of our website, our marketing endeavors and our services and offers; 
  * conducting research and analysis; 
  * notifying you about exhibits, events or activities we believe to be of interest to you; 
  * informing you about membership, development, or sponsorship activities; 
  * offering new products, services, sales, or other promotional events; 
  * allowing our licensees to offer you products or services which may be of interest to you, some of the proceeds of which may support the Museum; or
  * performing other business activities as needed. 



**Purchase Information**   
In addition to Personal Information, you may be requested to provide Purchase Information, including your credit card information, billing and/or shipping information, when you seek to engage in the following activities online, over the telephone, or in person:   


  * purchase a membership; 
  * purchase a product or service;

  * make a donation; 
  * register for educational programs, activities, group ticket sales, facility rentals, or package promotions offered in conjunction with other local businesses; or
  * participate in other activities offered by the Museum that require your Purchase Information. 



Your credit card information will be used only as needed to process your transaction and will not be stored in our systems after your transaction is complete.  So that we can track and service your order, we will retain your other Purchase Information, but not your credit card information, for our records.  This information generally is deleted after one year. 

**Children**   
The Museum does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years old through its website. However, the Museum may collect an email address in order to respond to one-time requests from children submitted online.  If the parent or guardian of a child under 13 believes that the child has provided us with any information, the parent or guardian of that child should contact us if they want this information deleted from our files.  If the Museum obtains knowledge that it has information about a child under 13 in retrievable form in its files, we will delete that information from our existing files. In addition, anyone under 18 years old should seek his or her parent’s or guardian’s permission prior to using or disclosing any information on this site. 

**Non-Personal Information**   
The Museum may collect Non-Personal Information about the visitors to our website.  Non-Personal Information includes anonymous information collected through use of technologies such as “cookies,” “spotlight tags” and “web beacons.” In using these technologies, we may collect your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, and the full Uniform Resource Locators (URL) clickstream to and from our website (including date and time).  We do not use persistent “cookies” or tracking mechanisms that collect Personal Information on our sites.  The information collected by the use of these technologies is anonymous and is not linked with the Personal Information you provide to the Museum. 

Non-Personal Information may be used to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our website, and to perform statistical analyses that are used internally to measure interest in various areas of our site and to help determine the usefulness of various products and services.  Using Non-Personal Information we may also compile and provide aggregate statistics about the use of our website, our visitors, customers, sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties.  These statistics will not include any Personal Information. 

## With Whom Do We Share Your Information? 

**Personal Information and Purchase Information**   
The Museum may share Personal Information, including Purchase Information, with certain third parties such as our agents, service providers and other representatives acting on our behalf for limited purposes.  For example, we may share Personal Information with third parties to perform services on our behalf such as:   


  * delivering packages;
  * registration for and participation in educational programs; 
  * order fulfillment; 
  * maintaining our membership program; 
  * conducting research and analysis; 
  * processing credit card payments; 
  * offering you products or services which may be of interest to you, some of the proceeds of which may support the Museum; 
  * sending Museum marketing communications; or
  * conducting other business activities as needed. 



The third parties with whom we conduct business are authorized to use your information only to perform the service for which they are hired. They are required to abide by the terms of our Privacy Policy including taking reasonable measures to ensure your personal information is secure. 

**Promotional Packages and Educational Programs**   
When you register for a promotional package (for example, a ticket package that offers you admission to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and to the Pro Football Hall of Fame for one price) or educational program (for example, a seminar for which teachers can obtain credit through an academic institution), your personal information, including your purchase information, may be shared with the businesses or educational institutions identified by name in the promotional package or educational program materials.  This is required to complete your reservation or registration in the promotional package or educational program.  While we strive to affiliate ourselves only with businesses and educational institutions that share our high standards and respect for privacy, we cannot be responsible for the content or privacy practices employed by these third parties.  For this reason, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of those third parties before disclosing any personal information to or through them. 

**Nonprofit Cultural Institutions**   
We reserve the right to share your Personal Information, but not your Purchase Information, with other nonprofit cultural institutions in the greater Cleveland area.  If you do not want to have your information used in this way, you may send an e-mail message containing your name and postal address to [donotshare@RockHall.org](mailto:donotshare@RockHall.org). 

In the event that the Museum enters into a business transition, such as a merger with or an acquisition by another company, or a sale of a portion of or all of its assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets that are transferred or disclosed in connection with such a transaction. 

From time to time, we may be required to share Personal Information in response to a valid court order, subpoena, government investigation, or as otherwise required by law.  We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we, in good faith, believe to be unlawful. We may share certain Personal Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property and safety of others and ourselves.
