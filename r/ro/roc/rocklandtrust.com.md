Privacy Notice

**Rockland Trust - Guardian Of Your Privacy**  
Rockland Trust Company is devoted to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this notice to outline the measures we take to protect your privacy.

**The Information We Have About You  
**In the normal course of business we receive information about you ("Your Information"), some of which may not be publicly available. Your Information may include:

  * your name and address, Social Security number, and information about your job, income, other debt, credit references, and other information which we receive from you on applications, forms, in person, by telephone, electronically, or by other means;
  * information about your transactions, including information about your account balances with us and other institutions, payment history, and account usage;
  * information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, including information about your creditworthiness; and
  * information from public sources, such as real estate records and telephone numbers.



**What We Do With Your Information**  
We use Your Information to protect you by, for example, confirming your identity at the time of a transaction. We may also use Your Information to serve you better by identifying products or services that may be of interest to you. As a consequence, we may disclose all of Your Information, as described above, to service providers that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

We do not otherwise disclose Your Information, or nonpublic information about our former customers, to anyone, except as required or permitted by law, such as when responding to a subpoena or other court order, complying with regulatory requests, or providing information to consumer reporting agencies.

**The Steps We Take To Protect Your Privacy**  
We restrict access to Your Information to only those employees who need to know it to provide products or services to you. All of our employees must adhere to strict policies designed to prevent any misuse of Your Information. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard Your Information.

Privacy: Frequently Asked Questions

These questions and answers are designed to prepare our employees to answer questions regarding our Privacy Notice and to otherwise assist customers who express privacy concerns.

**Why am I suddenly receiving privacy notices from many different sources?**  
A new Federal law requires that all financial institutions provide detailed annual disclosures to their customers describing their policies for collecting and disclosing non-public customer information on an annual basis.

**Why did Rockland Trust Company not give me an opportunity to opt-in or opt-out of information sharing?**  
Rockland Trust was not required to provide an "opt-out" or an "opt-in" because Rockland Trust currently does not give out customer information to telemarketers or otherwise share customer information in any way prohibited by law. Rockland Trust does not share any information about you with non-affiliated third parties, except as required or permitted by law, to process your transactions, or to provide additional products or services to you.

**For what customers/accounts do the privacy rules apply?**  
The rules apply to customers who maintain a deposit account or loan account or safe deposit box for personal, family or household purposes. The rules therefore do not apply to our commercial customers.

**Do you collect and use information on consumers who are not customers, such as non customers using your ATM and loan applicants who do not obtain loans?**  
We only obtain the information that is necessary to complete the transaction, and retain only the information that we are required by law to retain. We do not make any information available to any third party except to complete or confirm your request transaction or upon request by you.

**What third party marketing arrangements are currently in place?**  
We use IFMG Securities, a Sun Life financial company, to provide investment and insurance products to our customers. We also provide credit cards through our marketing partner MBNA. We do not provide account numbers or transaction information to them but do inform them that you are a customer of the bank.

**What kind of information do you collect?**  
The kind of information we collect depends upon your financial needs and the products and services you request. For example, when you apply for a loan or open an account with us, we need information about your financial status - such as your place of employment, income, monthly expenses and personal assets and debts outstanding - to process your requests. In addition, in order to make your banking as convenient and efficient as possible, we maintain information about your transactions with us, your account balance and repayment history. 

**How do you obtain the information?**  
We collect information from many sources. Much of the information comes directly from you when you complete a loan or account application. For a loan application, we also obtain information from credit bureaus and other creditors regarding your credit and repayment history. We retain communications from you (such as letters or e-mails) in order to handle questions you may have and to keep records of your request or concerns regarding our products and services. We also use your letters or e-mails to measure how effectively we have addressed your concerns. If you use our online banking service, we record your online sessions so that we can process and confirm your transactions and provide you with automatic online reports. We also obtain demographic and household information from outside sources such as database information firms. 

**Who has access to customer information?**  
We have strict internal policies against unauthorized use or disclosure of customer information. Customer information is accessible only to employees who need it to conduct your financial affairs. We emphasize the importance of confidentiality through our Code of Conduct, employee training, and operating procedures. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards according to established security standards to protect our customers' information.

**Why do you need this information?**  
We maintain information and data about you to maintain the security of your accounts and to protect you and the entire institution against fraud. We need accurate information to be able to positively identify you and authenticate your transactions in order to prevent access to your accounts by unauthorized individuals.

We also collect and analyze customer information as the first step in offering new products and services. For example, if we know you are a homeowner and may be in need of additional financing, we can recommend a home equity loan or credit line as an alternative to an installment loan because of its potential lower costs and tax benefits.

We are also required by laws and regulations to gather certain information. For example, we are required by federal regulation to obtain a tax identification number (generally a Social Security Number) for many of our accounts, including all savings, checking or investment accounts that pay interest.

**What do I do if I see any inaccurate information in my statements?**  
We work to ensure that your information is current, accurate, and as complete as possible. If you see any inaccuracy in your statements or in any other communications from us, please write to us at:

Rockland Trust Company  
Attention: Deposit Services,   
288 Union Street, Rockland, MA 02370;

or contact our Customer Information Center Representatives at **1-800-222-2299**.

**Are there any regulations allowing disclosure of account information?**  
Yes. Under current law, we are allowed to share certain information - such as your name, address and information about your accounts within our company. In some cases, such as fraud investigation or in response to a validly issued search warrant or subpoena, we may be required by law to provide certain information to law enforcement agencies. There are also laws and regulations that affect the sharing of information with outside firms such as check printers, data processors and marketing firms acting on behalf of the Bank.

**What about my medical records?**  
We neither collect nor share medical information.

**Why do you share information with outside third-party companies?**  
We use third parties to help us process your financial transactions and to provide you with a full range of financial products and services. For example, we use third parties to print your checks, to process your account transactions, to help us market our products and services, and to mail account statements on our behalf. This means more efficient services and helps keep your costs as low as possible. In addition, when you open an account or apply for a credit card, loan or line of credit, we use various credit bureaus as part of the process for approving your application. We may also use outside companies to help us with fraud investigation.

**What kind of information do you share with third-party companies?**  
The information shared depends on the product or service we are providing to you. We may share your name, address, Social Security Number, loan or credit card repayment history, or overdraft history, depending on the situation. We will not share your account number, access codes, Social Security Number, or driver's license number with any third party for purpose of marketing their products or services to you. 

**Will the third parties keep my information confidential?**  
We will not share information with any company that does not agree to keep your information confidential. We carefully select the third-party companies we work with, and any information that is shared is always subject to strict confidentiality agreement(s). Moreover, it is a violation of federal law for a third party to reuse customer information received from us unless that information is also publicly available elsewhere.

**Is it possible to prevent information sharing with third parties?**  
We do not sell, nor rent information to marketers or any third party. We do not share information with third parties such as insurance or investment firms, unless you initiate such a request. By law we would not be able to share your information without giving you the opportunity to "Opt-Out" - that is, you would be directing us not to make such disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). However, insofar as we do not share information with such parties, you do not need to take any action with Rockland Trust Company to prevent the sharing of such information.

**How can I reduce direct marketing from other companies?**  
If you would like to reduce the amount of advertising you receive from companies other than Rockland Trust Company, you may request that the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) delete your name from telephone, mailing and e-mail lists used by their members in marketing products and services to you. Information on these lists is normally obtained from public sources. Your request lasts for five years and includes all versions of your name in which you currently receive information, your address and your telephone number.

To remove your name from many national or direct mail lists write to:   
DMA Mail Preference Service  
P.O. Box 9008  
Farmingdale, NY 11735-9008

To avoid unwanted calls from many national marketers, send your name, address and telephone number to:  
DMA Telephone Preference Service  
P.O.Box 9014  
Farmingdale, NY 11735-9014
