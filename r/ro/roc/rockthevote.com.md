# Privacy Policy

Rock the Vote has a firm commitment to internet privacy. You can visit most portions of our web site, www.rockthevote.com, without telling us who you are and without revealing any personal information. The only information we collect from a normal web site visit is data used to generate statistics and measure site activity to improve the usefulness of the site to our visitors.

Rock the Vote may collect email addresses and other personally identifiable data about visitors when such data is voluntarily submitted to www.rockthevote.com. Rock the Vote makes every effort to ensure the secure collection and transmission of sensitive user information using industry accepted data collection methodologies.

Some information on our supporter lists, such as names, email addresses, and addresses, may be exchanged with named partners and other organizations with principles and/or missions that overlap with those of Rock the Vote. Supporters may opt out of such supporter list exchanges at any time. Our purpose is to protect your information while making sure you have what you need to make an informed decision on Election Day and build our power as a political voting bloc. After you mail in or electronically submit your voter registration application form to local or state election officials, it generally becomes a matter of public record from your state of residence. This means it will be available for inspection and use by candidates for public office and their campaign organizations as well as by others who satisfy the requirements of the State law governing its use.

Rock the Vote's Privacy Policy is subject to change. Unless stated otherwise, Rock the Vote's current policy applies to all information that Rock the Vote has about its supporters. Rock the Vote stands behind the promises it makes, and will not materially change its policies and practices to make them less protective of supporter information collected in the past without providing notice to affected supporters and allowing them the opportunity to opt out of any such changes.
