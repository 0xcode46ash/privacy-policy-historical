RotoGrinders understands your desire to have your personal information protected. We respect your concerns about privacy and describe below the types of information we collect, how we may use it, and with whom we may share it. Please contact us at support@rotogrinders.com with any questions you may have.

## Personal Information

We may request that you provide personal information if you contact us, create a RotoGrinders.com user account, request technical support, provide feedback, participate in a promotion, or seek business-related opportunities.

In order to create an account on RotoGrinders.com, you will need to select a user name and password and provide a valid e-mail address. We may also collect your time zone preference and location, should you choose to supply the latter.

We have taken appropriate security measures to protect your personal information. These measures protect your data from misuse or unauthorized access.

## Aggregate Information

We may collect aggregate and non-personal information when users visit our website. This includes, but is not limited to, how many users visit our site, pages accessed, and countries users came from. By collecting this information, we may learn how to best tailor our website to our visitors. We may track domain names, IP addresses, location, browser types, and other technical information from users who visit our site.

## Cookies

At times, we may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit RotoGrinders.com. These companies may use information about your visits to RotoGrinders.com and other sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

## Opting Out

If you do not wish to continue receiving our e-mails, you can opt out by clicking "Opt Out" in the footer of the e-mail or by contacting us at support@rotogrinders.com.

## Third Party Privacy Policies

Please consult the Privacy Policies of third parties we work with, such as ad networks, for their general practices.

## Legal Information

Rotogrinders respects your privacy and, under ordinary circumstances, will not disclose the personal or personally identifiable information you provide to us to third parties. There may be circumstances, however, when such disclosure is necessary and therefore will occur. For instance, Rotogrinders may be required by law to disclose this information to government officials and judicial/law enforcement officers, such as in response to a subpoena, warrant, court demand, or other properly issued legal process. Additionally, such disclosure may be necessary for us to protect and enforce our legal rights. Consistent with this, we reserve the right to disclose personal or personally identifiable information to third parties where necessary – in our sole discretion – to protect the integrity of the site or where other pressing business need presents itself.

## Links to External Websites

On RotoGrinders.com, there may be links to companies with whom we have a business relationship. We encourage you to read their Privacy Policies carefully. We may also link to websites that are maintained by one or more of our business partners who are collecting your information pursuant to their own policies.

## Deleting and Editing Forum Posts

There is no option to delete your own posts, but you may contact support@rotogrinders.com with any concerns you have. Deleting posts often disrupts the general flow of forum threads, as other posters have likely responded to the community's comments and generated additional discussion. RotoGrinders reserves the right to delete any post at any time.

## Consent to Display Information

RotoGrinders reserves the right to display any information you submit in your profile, including, but not limited to, real name and screen names(s). RotoGrinders displays information on your winning results accrued under the screen names you enter in your RotoGrinders Profile.
