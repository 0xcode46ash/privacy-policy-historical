# Learning A-Z | Privacy

Learning A-Z offers a number of websites (the “Service”) through a purchased license that provide access to a Data Management System. This system is an integral component of Learning A-Z' student-based curriculum products and provides valuable reporting, instructional recommendations, and other resources used by teachers and other instructional leaders in conjunction with Learning A-Z' curriculum with the goal of improving student performance.

  This statement describes the privacy and security practices Learning A-Z employs for this Service. We have adopted these practices to protect you, the students, and the educational institution, and to enable both of us to comply with applicable legal requirements. Use of this Services requires acceptance of the practices outlined in this statement.

  Two types of personally identifiable information are used on this site: **your personal data** and **student data**.

  **Your Personal Data**

Collection: Learning A-Z collects information from you as you use this site. For example, you must enter certain personally identifiable information, including your name, e-mail address, and phone number. We use this information to verify your identity, prevent unauthorized access to your account, and to contact you in connection with your use of the Services.

  In addition to the information you provide, Learning A-Z collects information about your use of this site through tracking, cookies, and log files, as described in our general [Terms of Service](http://help.learninga-z.com/customer/portal/articles/1649233-terms-of-service) statement.

  Protection: Because you enter your personal data, you control its accuracy. If you discover that your personal data is inaccurate or if it changes, you are responsible for correcting the information either directly on your Account, or by [Contacting Us](http://www.learninga-z.com/contact-support.html). We will not use your personal data collected through the Service for any purpose other than providing you with access to purchased website(s) and the associated services. We will not share your personal data collected through the Service with third persons without your consent. However, your personal data will be available to authorized users from your school educational institution who have permission from the school educational institution to access it. We will use the same security to protect your personal data that we use to protect student data collected through this site.

  **Student Data**

Collection: As you use this site, you will enter student data, or interact with student data that has already been entered, into the Learning A-Z Data Management System.

Protection: Learning A-Z takes seriously the security of this student data and complies with all Federal law pursuant to its protection as outlined in our [Student Data Security and Confidentiality Statement](http://help.learninga-z.com/customer/portal/articles/1649237-student-data-security-and-confidentiality-statement).

  Federal law (the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, "FERPA") allows a school educational institution to release student records to an organization that is "conducting studies for, or on behalf of, educational agencies or institutions for the purpose of developing, validating, or administering predictive tests... [or] improving instruction." However, FERPA requires limitations on disclosure of those records and implementation of appropriate security measures to protect those records. To help your school educational institution comply with FERPA, Learning A-Z has adopted certain practices, and requires that educators using this site fulfill certain responsibilities to safeguard student data. The following statement explains our practices and your responsibilities regarding the student data you enter on this site.

  Additionally, Learning A-Z operates in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and will not knowingly collect or use personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.
