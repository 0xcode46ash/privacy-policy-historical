#### INFORMATION COLLECTED FOR TRACKING AND CUSTOMIZATION (COOKIES)

A cookie is a small file that a Web site transfers to your computer to allow it to remember specific information about your session while you are connected. Your computer will only share the information in the cookie with the Web site that provided it, and no other Web site can request it. There are two types of cookies, session and persistent. Session cookies last only as long as your Web browser is open. Once you close your browser, the cookie disappears. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for longer periods of time.

RazorSync Web sites may use session cookies for technical purposes such as to enable better navigation through the site, or to allow you to customize your preferences for interacting with the site. A few RazorSync Web sites may also make use of persistent cookies to remember you between visits so, for example, you can save your customized preference settings for future visits. Each RazorSync site using persistent cookies identifies itself as doing so.

At no time is your private information, whether stored in persistent cookies or elsewhere, shared with third parties who have no right to that information. If you do not wish to have session or persistent cookies stored on your machine, you can turn them off in your browser. However, this may affect the functioning of some RazorSync Web sites.

#### PERSONAL INFORMATION

If you choose to provide us with personal information, through such methods as completing a form or sending us an email, we will use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information or services you have requested.

Some of our Web sites ask visitors who request specific information to fill out a registration form. For example, customers looking for software, services or support information by RazorSync, may be asked to register to obtain email notices of product and service opportunities. Other information collected at Web sites through questionnaires, feedback forms, or other means, enables us to determine visitors’ interests, with the goal of providing better service to our customers.
