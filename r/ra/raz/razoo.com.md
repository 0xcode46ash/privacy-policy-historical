## The Razoo Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy is simple--we are vigilant about protecting yours. Our mission is to serve donors and provide you with the best possible experience so you can focus on your giving, and that all starts with a trusting relationship.

Razoo and our partner, Network for Good, will never sell, trade, or rent your personal information to other individuals or companies. The information you provide will only be used to complete your donation and to provide you with tools to manage and monitor your transactions. With your permission, your name and contact information will be provided to the charity you support through Razoo and Network for Good. If you do not wish to share your name and contact information with the charity you supported, or you choose to make your donation anonymously, neither Razoo nor Network for Good will share your name or contact information.

We do offer several ways to stay in touch with Razoo and the organizations you support, and we always put you in control of that communication. We are constantly working to deliver the information you need to make good decisions and understand how your money is put to use, but we also appreciate the fact that not everyone wants that. There are some communications, however, that we (and the government) consider critical and you will definitely receive from Razoo and Network For Good--such as a donation confirmation or an alert about a problem with your credit card. If you ever have a question about our policies or feel that we are not living up to this standard, weâ€™d love to talk. Feel free to email us at [support@razoo.com](mailto:support@razoo.com) and we will get back to you promptly.
