**POLICY FOR USERS**  
Radar Online may collect personal information from users in order to provide them with a personalized online experience and to provide our advertisers a way to reach the right audience. Radar may share the personal and aggregate information we collect with our affiliates and other sites operated by and for Radar. On a confidential basis, Radar may also share personal information with our corporate affiliates or consultants or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf (such as fulfilling orders or for general site administration purposes). Radar shares aggregate information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. Radar may also disclose personal information in response to legal process, such as a request by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of our site if we believe that a guest has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts.

This information is stored at Radar Online solely for the purpose of sending the e-mail.

**USE OF IP ADDRESSES**  
An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you log on to the Web. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address, so when a guest requests pages from our site, our servers log the guest's IP address. The IP addresses of our guests are collected only for the purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers, our corporate affiliates or consultants, or with third parties that perform a particular service on our behalf. We do not combine IP addresses with any personally identifying information, nor do we compile any session activity reports by IP address.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
In cyberspace, cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes.

Cookies make Web surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you're at a site. The use of cookies is an industry standard; you'll find them at most major Web sites. 

By showing how and when guests use the site, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not and help in targeting ads based on guest interests. Many improvements and updates to the site are based on such data as total number of guests and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

A cookie allows us to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to our site, which in turn allows us to speed up your future activities at our site. Similarly, the stores hosted by our site usually use cookies to track which products you've chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. During future visits to our site, we will only read and retrieve information that we set in a cookie during an earlier visit to our site. 

The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is also standard in the Internet industry. Accordingly, you may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. Radar Online does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to the Radar Online Privacy Policy. By the same token, our advertisers do not have access to Radar Online's cookies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site function properly if you do so. Specifically, you will not be able to purchase products or services through this site unless you accept a cookie. If you have any additional questions or concerns pertaining to the privacy of information collected on this site, send an [email](https://web.archive.org/web/20040603122033id_/http%3A//LIVE%20SITE%2005.23.03/contact/contact.html).
