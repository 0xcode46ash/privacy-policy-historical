# Privacy Policy | Radioplayer

The privacy of our users is important to us. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information received and collected by Radioplayer and how it is used.

**Log files**

Like many other Web sites, [www.radioplayer.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20110623214503id_/http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/index.php/privacy/www.radioplayer.co.uk) makes use of log files. The information inside the log files includes internet protocol ( IP ) addresses, type of browser, Internet Service Provider ( ISP ), date/time stamp, referring/exit pages, and number of clicks. We use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movements around the site, and gather demographic information. IP addresses, and other such information are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable.

**Cookies**

[www.radioplayer.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20110623214503id_/http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/index.php/privacy/www.radioplayer.co.uk) does use cookies to store information about visitors preferences, record user-specific information on which pages the user access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors browser type or other information that the visitor sends via their browser.

**Blog posts**

If you contribute to our blog, we will collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. We only disclose logged- in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described above, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

**The Radioplayer listening console**

**Common console features**

Radioplayer also uses cookies* and collects search terms and IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet) from visitors. We do this to:

\- Allow users to personalise their Radioplayer experience – for example by setting stations as favourites in the My Stations feature.

\- Analyse and improve the service we offer – for example by understanding how often visitors return to a Radioplayer station, or what they search for most.

\- Track the growth of Radioplayer and market it as a service. We may disclose information in aggregate (so that no individuals are identified) for marketing purposes.

\- Radioplayer will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies).

Sometimes Radioplayer will use third parties to process your information. If we do so, we will require that they don’t use your personal information for their own business purposes, unless you have explicitly consented to the use of your personal information in this way.

**Google Analytics**

Radioplayer uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. Google Analytics sets a cookie* in order to evaluate your use of Radioplayer and compile reports for us on activity across the Radioplayer network.

Radioplayer uses Google Analytics with the “anonymizeIP()” function, which ensures that your IP address is shortened before it is stored and therefore cannot be linked directly to you.

Google stores the information collected by the cookie* on servers in the United States. Google may also transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google’s behalf. Google will not associate your anonymised IP address with any other data held by Google.  By using this website, you consent to the processing of data about you by Google in the manner and for the purposes set out above.

**Third party sites beyond Radioplayer**

Both the Radioplayer website and the Radioplayer listening console contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties (for example radio stations which have chosen to join Radioplayer).

These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies*, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or data which is collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

**Questions and comments**

If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to get in touch via the ‘Contact’ page at [www.radioplayer.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20110623214503id_/http://www.radioplayer.co.uk/index.php/privacy/www.radioplayer.co.uk)

_*A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier, sent to your computer or device from a website and stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you. Users can set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The latter means that certain personalised features cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly they may not be able to take full advantage of all of the website’s features._
