# RadioShack Privacy Policy

The following Privacy Policy applies only to RadioShack web sites and information provided by you or otherwise collected online through a RadioShack web site. For the privacy policies applicable to information collected in our stores or by other means, see the sign posted in stores titled, “We Value Our Relationship.”  
  _We Are Concerned About Privacy_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Your privacy is very important to us. RadioShack respects and protects the privacy of its visitors. In this document, we explain how we use the information you supply us. If we update our privacy policy, all revisions will be posted on this page. We reserve the right to change the privacy policy at any time.  
  _Information Collection and Use_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Two types of information may be collected when you visit our web sites, information that you knowingly provide us (called personally identifiable information), and information that is obtained from your visit but is not directly associated with you (called non-personally identifiable information).  
  _Personally Identifiable Information_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Personally identifiable information may include information that you provide to us by requesting information, when registering for special offers or programs or when you purchase products online. This may include your name, address (including billing and shipping addresses), telephone number, e-mail address, organization, city, state and zip code, and whether you are purchasing for personal or business use. We may use this information, to process and ship orders, to contact you about the status of your order, to contact you with answers to your questions, or to provide information about new and exciting products, services, promotions and corporate-related information. We may use mailings, telephone calls and e-mail to contact you. 

 For those customers who purchase products from us online, additional personally identifiable information such as credit card information will be collected. This information is collected in order to process your order. 

 We are committed to the protection of the privacy of our customers and visitors. While in the checkout process of our online store, we make use of [128 bit encryption](http://www.verisign.com/products/site/faq/128-bit.html) via digital IDs provided and certified by [VeriSign, Inc](http://www.verisign.com/). These IDs enable our commerce site to conduct authenticated, strongly encrypted online commerce. Customers can submit credit card numbers or other personal information to our site with the assurance that they are doing business with us (not an impostor's "spoof" of our site) and that the information which they are sending to us cannot be intercepted or decrypted by anyone else.

  _Non-Personally Identifiable Information_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Non-personally identifiable information is collected without any direct association with you specifically. In the normal course of using a RadioShack web site, we may collect information about your habits and usage of our sites. 

 Our web sites may contain technologies known as action tags, web beacons or 1x1 pixel gifs. These employ a common internet technique used to compile aggregated statistics about the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, common navigation paths within the sites, types of browsers and platforms that access the sites and the average connection speeds used to connect to the sites. This information is used to enhance the online experience of our customers. These technologies do not use or collect personally identifiable information, such as names or address, and do not link online actions to an identifiable person. 

 An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you are using the Internet. Web servers automatically identify your computer by its IP address.  
RadioShack collects IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregated information and to audit the use of our site. If we are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena, we will provide these IP addresses to the proper authorities.  
  
  _Information Sharing and Disclosure_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Agents, employees and contractors of RadioShack who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy and the high standards of the corporation. 

  * Information about you specifically will not be used for any purpose other than to carry out the services you requested from RadioShack and its affiliates.


  * We will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone at any time.


  * We will not use any personal information beyond what is necessary to assist us in delivering to you the services you have requested.


  * We will send personally identifiable information about you to other organizations when:
    * We have your consent to share the information (you will be provided the opportunity to opt-out if you desire).
    * We need to share your information in order to provide the product or service you have requested.
    * We are required to do so by law, for example, in response to a court order or subpoena.

  
  _Use Of Cookies And Applets_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
Cookies and applets are small text files that are placed on your computer’s hard drive by our servers to identify your computer. Cookies and applets are only read by the domain that placed them there and are unable to execute any code or virus. We may use cookies or applets to recognize you when you visit our sites, to personalize your experience and generally to serve you better. We do not use cookies or applets to track your activities once you leave our web site. 

 You may delete these files from your computer at any time. You can set your web browser to notify you if such information is about to be placed on your computer, and you can choose the option in your web browser to refuse it. If you refuse the information, you may not be able to make full use of the features on our web site.  
  
  _Kids 13 Years Old Or Younger_ | [back to top...](https://web.archive.org/web/20030618050122id_/http%3A//www.radioshack.com/images/site/legal/rsprivacy.asp#top)  
RadioShack web sites do not seek to collect identification information about kids 13 years of age or younger. If we discover such information, we will delete it. Thus, we typically retain no identifiable information about kids. However, if a parent believes his/her child has provided us information, simply call and request that we delete it. In order for us to find the information in our databases, you will need to provide us with the following information which will only be used to search our databases and deliver confirmation to you: 

  * Parent’s Name
  * Address
  * Telephone Number
  * Email Address (for confirmation)
  * The name of the child (if you suspect a nickname was used, please provide it)
  * If the child shares time at two addresses, you will need to provide us the second address also, along with any email addresses for the child.

In order to request deletion of identifiable information that RadioShack may have unintentionally collected about your child, please call **(817)415-3200**. Please inform the service agent that you wish to delete your child’s information, and supply the service agent with the necessary information as stated above. 

 Confirmation that information which identifies your child has been deleted will be delivered to you by e-mail, regular mail, or telephone. 

 PLEASE NOTE: Deleting your child’s information will likely make it impossible for us to notify you or your child in the event of a recall of a product he or she purchased in violation of our policies. So if your child purchased ANYTHING from us in spite of our efforts to prevent it, you may not wish to delete all information. Instead, you may simply request that we correct the information by correcting the name in our records to your name rather than your child’s. 

 In consideration of young users, it is our intention to adhere to the Better Business Bureau’s [“Children Advertising Review Unit” (CARU) guidelines](http://www.caru.org/), including its [guidelines on advertising](http://www.caru.org/carusubpgs/guidepg.asp). When you communicate with RadioShack, we make every effort to ensure your privacy and safety. As an added precaution, however, we still encourage parents to monitor their child’s use of the Internet, and to help us protect their privacy by reminding them never to exchange personal information with this or any other web site without the assistance or express written permission of a parent or other responsible adult.
