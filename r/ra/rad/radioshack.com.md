# RadioShack Copyrights

|  |  | We're Concerned About Privacy  
---  
RadioShack.com understands and respects the privacy of its users. As a general policy, no personal information is automatically collected from visitors to its sites. However, certain non-personal information about visitors is recorded by the standard operation of RadioShack.com Internet servers. Information tracked includes the type of browser being used by the visitor (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system (e.g., Macintosh, Windows) in use by the visitor and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). This information helps us to optimize RadioShack.com for a particular visitor's computer. This information is also used to track the number of visitors to the site in an aggregate and non-personally-identifiable form, and to save shopping cart information for a specified period of time (see below). 

RadioShack is committed to the protection of the privacy of its customers and website visitors. Currently, our website systems do not automatically capture any personal information identifiable to you, including your e-mail address, unless you specifically give it to us. 

In order to fulfill your requests or provide you with information that you request it will be necessary at times to ask for certain personal information such as your name and address, telephone number or e-mail address. We may use this information to contact you with questions or information about orders that you may place or to ship products or provide services to you. We also may use this information in our continuing efforts to keep our customers and friends informed about new and exciting products, services and promotions that we offer, which may include mailings, telephone calls and e-mail mailings. 

We do not engage in the practice of selling our customer lists or customer information to third parties. However, we do from time to time engage in joint marketing or other similar arrangements with responsible companies, and in the course of such activities may share our customer information with such parties, which sharing may result in communications by such parties to you. This sharing is done solely as a result of our belief that the information communicated to you by such parties will be of interest to you. 

We may, from time to time, need to place identification information or application programs on your computer to enable you to properly access, display or read our catalogue or other information or to permit information to follow you from page to page (in order to use a virtual shopping cart for example). This information may sometimes be called "cookies". Also, applications sometimes known as "applets" might be downloaded to your computer to better display the information you requested from our website. We do not use cookies or applets to track your activities once you leave our website. Applets are deleted when you leave our website and you may remove the cookies from your computer at any time. You can set your web browser to notify you if such information is about to be placed on your computer, and choose the option in your web browser to refuse it. If you refuse the information, you may not be able to make full use of the features on our website.  
   
  
KIDS UNDER 13 YEARS OLD  
  
RadioShack.com does not seek to collect personal information about kids under 13 years of age through its website. If we discover such information, we will delete it. Thus, we typically retain no information about kids. However, if a parent requests a review of information we may have on their child and in the unlikely event we still retain such information and haven't deleted it, then we will honor that request. In order to request a review or deletion of personal information that RadioShack.com may have collected about your child, please call 1-800-The-Shack. Please inform the service agent that you wish to review or delete your child's personal information . 

Our website contains links to other websites that are not operated or controlled by RadioShack.com. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OF, AND USE OF CHILDREN'S PERSONAL INFORMATION BY, WEBSITES THAT WE DON'T OPERATE, and this policy does not apply to linked sites. Some examples of sites we link to are: Compaq, Fluke Corp, and X-10 and you may view their privacy policies at <http://www.compaq.com/copyright.html>, <http://www.fluke.com/privacy.asp>, and <http://www.x10.com/corporate/privacy.htm>. 

In consideration of young users, it is our intention to adhere to the Better Business Bureau's "Children Advertising Review Unit" (CARU) guidelines, including its guidelines on advertising. When you communicate with RadioShack.com, we make every effort to ensure your privacy and safety. As an added precaution, however, we still encourage parents to monitor their child's use of the Internet, and to help us protect their privacy by reminding them never to exchange personal information with this or any other website without the assistance or express written permission of a parent or other responsible adult.
