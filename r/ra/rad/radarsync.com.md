> Our RadarSync website does not collect information about visitors.

**RadarSync Desktop Client.**

> RadarSync regularly contacts RadarSync's and your device manufacturer's update servers to check if newer versions of RadarSync, device drivers, or pre-installed software updates are available. If newer versions are available, RadarSync will notify the user and give the user the option to upgrade. The user has the ability to disable the update check at any time. Instructions for disabling this feature can be found at RadarSync.com for [Windows](http://www.radarsync.com/techsupport/uninstall.html) versions of the software and in RadarSync Options menu. No personal information whatsoever is transmitted back to RadarSync or device manufacturers during these processes. 

**RadarSync Information Broadcasting Features**

> **Product Offers  
> ** From time to time, RadarSync may broadcast product offers or promotions from your manufacturer. These advertisements and offers are targeted based on your computer information (type, features, upgrade needs), but not based on any personal information about you. Users have the option of configuring RadarSync so that they do not receive these product offers and promotions.
> 
> From time to time, some of RadarSync's advertising will only be applicable to certain geographic regions (phone services, insurance providers, etc). In such cases, RadarSync will use the user's IP address to send the most appropriate advertising. Many IP addresses are commonly associated with Internet service providers, universities, or major corporations in specific regions or localities. The only information used in this procedure is the data about the geographic region from which the user's computer is contacting the Internet. Absolutely no personal information (email address, address of residence, demographics, etc.) is revealed to RadarSync, your product manufactuer, or our advertisers in these situations.
