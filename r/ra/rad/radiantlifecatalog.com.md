**What information is collected?**  
For each visitor to our site, Radiant Life automatically recognizes only the customer's IP address, not the individual's email address. We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record session information (such as items that customers add to their shopping basket), record past activity at the site in order to provide better service when visitors return to the site, and to customize (when appropriate) web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitors sends. 

This information is used for internal review and is then discarded. It is not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. Additional information given directly by the visitor (e-mail address, name, mailing address) is discussed below. 

**Site Security**

We always use industry-standard encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data exchanged with our site. You can feel safe ordering online with Radiant Life. Any page on our site that handles sensitive information, such as your credit card number, is securely encrypted using the Secure Sockets layer (SSL) protocol.  |

It's easy to know if a web site is secure. When you are accessing a secure web site a closed lock will be displayed in the status bar of your browser window. 

**E-mail Addresses**  
The following are policies we have established for the collection and use of e-mail addresses. Radiant Life is aware of consumers’ concern over unauthorized use of their e-mail address (spamming) and will do everything possible to protect the privacy of our visitors without hindering the services we provide to them. 

1\. When we collect an email address of an individual placing an online order, over the phone, or mail-in; filling out a form to contact us; or registering on our site, we will send them further promotional e-mails unless they opt-out after receiving an email. 

2\. If a visitor signs up to receive promotional e-mails from us, we will consider this opt-in permission. 

3\. Every promotional e-mail we send will contain an option for the recipient to opt-out, and not receive any future promotional e-mails. 

4\. We will not rent or exchange our e-mail addresses. 

**Mailing Addresses**  
The following are policies we plan to follow in regards to mailing addresses we collect: 

1\. Unless notified otherwise, we will mail future print catalogs to any mailing address we gather from an online order, phone order, mail-in order, or an online catalog request. 

2\. Any print customer wishing to not receive any future mailings may do so by contacting us via e-mail or mail, at the address above. Please provide us with your exact name and address. 

**Changes in Policies**  
From time to time we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our website to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt-out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our website periodically.
