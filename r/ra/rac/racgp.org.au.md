# RACGP - Privacy statement

## Privacy statement

## 1\. Your personal information is important to us

The RACGP recognises your privacy is very important to you and that you have rights to control your personal information. Providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. We are committed to protecting your personal information.

## 2\. Privacy statement

This Privacy statement sets out the RACGP's policy relating to the collection and use of your personal information, and is designed to provide you with options as to how we collect and use your personal information.

This Privacy statement also sets out how we manage personal information to meet our obligations under the Privacy Act.

We believe our Privacy statement not only complies with relevant laws but also represents best practice. In the unlikely instance this Statement conflicts with the Privacy Act, the Privacy Act will prevail.

## 3\. Definitions

Personal information means information or opinions about a person from which that person is reasonably identifiable. Personal information includes sensitive information.

Sensitive information includes information about a person's beliefs, associations or health.

Health information means information or opinions about a person’s health, or collected in accordance with a health services provided to them.

## 4\. Collecting your personal information

The RACGP may collect personal information as reasonably necessary for one or more of its functions. We will only collect personal information by lawful and fair means and primarily directly from you (for example, through our interaction with you or your use of our website).

As a non-profit organisation, we may collect members’ sensitive information for activities that further our charitable purposes, where the information relates to that purpose.

However, wherever practicable we will de-identify personal information. In certain circumstances you may not need to identify yourself, or may use of a pseudonym instead. We will ordinarily alert you to these circumstances when relevant.

The type of personal information collected may depend on your interaction with us. For example, if you are an RACGP Member, we may collect:

4.1.1 your name

4.1.2 your contact information (address, telephone etc), including your preferred manner of contact for personal and professional purposes

4.1.3 professional practice information, including qualifications, addresses and areas of professional interest

4.1.4 information relating to your membership or Fellowship, assessments and continuing professional development requirements (as appropriate).

If we receive unsolicited personal information, or information we would not ordinarily be permitted to collect, we will ordinarily destroy or de-identify that information.

We will take reasonable steps to notify you of our collection of your personal information. Any such notification will include all additional information required by the Privacy Act.

## 5\. Use of your personal information

Personal information is kept until we are no longer legally obliged to keep them, or when the need for the personal information has passed (at which point it will be destroyed, deleted or de-identified). Our purpose for collecting your personal information will to a degree depend on your interaction with us.

For members, our primary purpose for collection is to provide you with your full benefits of and administering your Membership, and providing services (unless I have “opted out” by advising the RACGP Membership Department), sending related information, or as a record of confirmation of attainment of academic or QI&CPD qualifications.

For QI&CPD participants, our primary purpose is similar, though focussed on administering and maintaining your QI&CPD status.

For other individuals, personal information may be collected to respond to enquiries or comply with other legal obligations.

We may also require limited disclosure to contractors we engage to act for us or on our behalf, such as IT service providers, in order to enable them to provide their services. All contractors engaged in this fashion are required to comply with this policy.

Other than for administration or membership purposes, or to confirm whether you have achieved Fellowship with the RACGP, we will not use or disclose your personal information without your consent. Some permitted exceptions to this apply, including where we are legally required to disclose, or to protect the personal safety of any individual or the public.

We will not ordinarily disclose your personal information to anyone outside of Australia. However, we do share limited subsets of member’s personal information, to our engaged external contact centres to provide related business, marketing and support services. This provider is currently based in the United States of America. Any information disclosed is used strictly only for the intended purposes. We periodically review our engagement of such providers to ensure privacy compliance.

## 6\. Storage and security of your personal information

We take all reasonable steps to keep your personal information secure, safe and protected from misuse, interference, loss or unauthorised access. Your information is either stored on secure servers (electronic records) or is protected in controlled facilities (hard copy records). In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.

You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the RACGP website. You should regularly change your website password, and in setting a password you should use a combination of letters (upper and lower case), numbers and special characters (!, @ etc). Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other individual or any other breach of security.
