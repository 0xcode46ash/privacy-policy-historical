# RACGP - Privacy Statement for the RACGP Website

This statement sets out the College's policies relating to the collection and use of personal information.

**Your personal information is important to us**

The College recognises that your privacy is very important to you and that you have a right to control your personal information. We know that providing personal information is an act of trust and we take that seriously. Unless you give us explicit consent to act otherwise, the following policy will govern how the College handles your personal information and safeguards your privacy. The College is committed to protecting your personal information and giving you choice in who can use your personal information and how it can be used. We believe that our privacy policy not only complies with relevant laws but also represents best practice. 

**Collecting personal information about you**

If you are a College member, we collect personal information about you in order to provide you with the full benefits of Membership. We collect information from you directly and also from time to time thereafter if you provide us additional information. 

Once you are a member, we maintain a record of the status of your membership and a history of your transactions with the College. 

**Our use of cookies and applets on our web site**

Cookies are pieces of information that a web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies. However, if you do not wish to receive any cookies you may set your browser to refuse cookies. In some instances this may mean you will not be able to take full advantage of parts of the College's web site. 

The use of cookies can enhance your experience of what is offered by the College. Cookies can provide us with aggregated information on how people use our website, and which advertisements are effective, which helps us to keep improving our Network. We also use cookies to operate the Membership system, as they help us to identify visitors to the site who have previously registered.

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's browser. The cookies simply contain a unique identifier which help us to know what our customers find interesting and useful on our website, almost like a continuing questionnaire. 

**Using and disclosing your personal information**

The College will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent unless: 

  * Required by law.
  * We believe it necessary to provide you with a service that you have requested. 
  * To implement our terms of use. 
  * To protect the rights or property of the College, any College user, or any member of the public. 
  * To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety. 



In order to provide some services to members, the College may be required to provide Members' contact details to third party suppliers of services. The College provides the opportunity to opt-out of such third party arrangements.

If any Member does not want their contact details passed on to third parties for the purposes of member benefits, please contact our Membership Office on (03) 8699 0414.

**"Spam" (Promotional Mail)**

We will not send you "spam" (advertising information) without first asking you whether you wish to have promotional information sent to you. If you are receiving promotional information about the College and do not wish to receive this information any longer, you may remove your name from our list either by visiting the web site or emailing us at [webeditor@racgp.org.au](mailto:webeditor@racgp.org.au) and asking to be removed from our mailing list. Please allow 10 working days for this request to be processed. 

**Storage and security of your personal information**

The College will endeavour to take all reasonable steps to keep secure any information which we hold about you, and to keep this information accurate and up to date. Your information is stored on secure servers or is protected in controlled facilities.

In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by the College. However, the College will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information. You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the College website. Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.

**You can access the information we keep about you**

If you wish to know what information we hold about you, please contact the Membership Office on (03) 8699 0414. We will respond to your request within 30 days. 

**What to do if you have a problem or question**

If the College becomes aware of any ongoing concerns or problems with sites on our Network, we will take these issues seriously and work to address these concerns. If you have any further queries relating to our privacy policy, or you have a problem or complaint, please contact us on (03) 8699 0414.

**Future changes**

From time to time, our policies will be reviewed and may be revised. The College reserves the right to change its privacy policy at any time and notify you by posting an updated version of the policy on our web site.
