# Privacy Statement

**PRIVACY STATEMENT**

This statement was last amended on 17 December 2001. 

**1\. About this Privacy Statement**

This Privacy Statement applies to your use of the web site of RACQ (ABN 72 009 660 575). This includes using any of RACQ’s facilities via the web site. 

Serving our members and customers effectively, securely and as conveniently as possible is considered vitally important at RACQ. We recognise that some people have concerns about the performance of online technology and how their personal information will be stored and used. 

We understand the importance people place on their personal information. At RACQ we are committed to ensuring that all information collected by us is treated with the appropriate degree of privacy and confidentiality. 

The following Privacy Statement is intended to provide you with a detailed explanation of how and when we collect your personal information, how it is stored and distributed within RACQ. 

**2\. Collection of Personal Information**

The nature of personal information collected and maintained by RACQ generally comprises name, address, age group, membership numbers, personal contact details (including phone fax and email addresses). We also obtain and store details about your motor vehicle ownership and your service and product preferences. This information is collected for the purpose of establishing and maintaining a service provider relationship with you. Providing incomplete or incorrect information may mean that we are unable to provide you with the level of service that you are seeking. 

To monitor and improve our service delivery we collect information on web site activity such as the number of users who visit our web site, dates and times of visits, number of pages viewed, navigation patterns, country of origin and systems used to access our site and when entering our site from another site, the address of that site. This information does not identify an individual but it does provide RACQ with statistics that we can use to analyse and improve our web site. 

We do not collect or store information about anyone’s political or religious beliefs, ethnic background or sexual preferences. 

**3\. How is your information used?**

We collect the information to help us provide accurate and up to date information about our business, the services and the products we provide. This will help you make informed decisions and helps us offer the best service we can. 

The information collected is used for: 

  * Developing new services and products 
  * Improving the quality of our service delivery 
  * Preventing unauthorised access to customer information 
  * Business and statutory reporting purposes 
  * Marketing our services and products 
  * Compliance with Laws and Regulations 



**4\. Disclosure of Personal Information**

We may distribute customer information within the businesses that operate under the RACQ brand or disclose it to other third parties such as suppliers of services (contracted service providers) or to conduct specialised activities such as high volume email mail-outs or to supply specialised products such as financial services offerings. 

We do share personal information with reputable organisations such as American Express, through RACQ Credit Cards and Heritage Building Society, through RACQ Finance to bring you specialised offers but such sharing of personal information is related to that product only and is protected under contractual arrangements. 

While personal information may be provided to these third parties to allow them to perform their agreed tasks, the information remains the property of RACQ at all times. The Agent organisations involved are bound by specific confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements. We take our obligations to protect client information very seriously and take every effort to deal only with ethical suppliers who share and demonstrate this same attitude. 

**5\. Protection of Customer information**

RACQ ensures that all customer data is kept securely and in accordance with prevailing laws. We will take all reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse or unauthorised alteration. 

Our employees understand their responsibility to protect and use correctly, information provided by our customers. 

**6\. Accessing Your Personal Information**

You can request us to provide you with access to information we hold about you. If we are able to, we will provide you with access. A fee may apply to providing you with such access but only where the request to provide the information takes up a considerable amount of time. Normally a fee will not apply. The information we can provide is limited to the personal information we hold about you and the services and products that we supply to you. 

If we are unable to agree to your request, we will explain why. 

**7\. Promotional material via Email**

You may choose to opt out of RACQ’s marketing communications activities. We respect and acknowledge your right to do this. If you do not wish to receive marketing and promotional materials via email from RACQ please email us, being sure to provide your name, address and membership card number. You can also telephone our call centre on 13 19 05 and we will remove your name from our direct marketing list. 

From time to time RACQ may prepare and distribute to members and the general public information bulletins on matters of concern or safety to motorists. We do not regard these bulletins as marketing or promotional materials and reserve the right to distribute such items to members in the public interest. 

**8\. Keeping Your Information Up to Date**

We will do our best to keep your personal information accurate, complete and up to date. You can help us with this by advising us if you believe that any of the information we hold is incomplete or inaccurate.
