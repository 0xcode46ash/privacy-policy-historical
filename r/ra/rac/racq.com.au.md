### Disclosure of your information to third parties

Personal information that we collect from you may be disclosed to:

  * any entity to which we are required or authorised by or under law to disclose such information (for instance, law enforcement agencies and investigative agencies, courts, various other government bodies)
  * other third parties that you have been informed of at the time when any personal information is collected from you;
  * our contractors, agents or business partners for purposes directly related to the purpose for which the personal information is collected, for example, other roadside assist organisations should you require assistance outside of Queensland.

### Disclosure of your information to third parties overseas

RACQ may need to disclose your personal information to an overseas recipient. You consent to RACQ making these disclosures as RACQ deems necessary to administer and supply the requested services to you. You acknowledge that overseas recipients are not required to comply with the requirements of the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ and you acknowledge that you are not able to enforce your rights under the _Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)_ if an overseas entity breaches that _Act_. Your personal information may be disclosed overseas for the following purposes:

  1. Where you have to have engaged us to act as your agent and the services you have requested us to provide require us to deal with overseas organisations (Where RACQ acts as your travel agent, it may be necessary for us to disclose personal information to an overseas travel provider for the purposes of arranging your booking with them.  As we deal with many providers world-wide, it is not possible for us to set out in this policy, all of the different countries to whom we may send your information, however, should you have any specific questions relating to whom your personal information may be sent, please refer to your travel consultant)
  2. Where you have agreed that RACQ may communicate with you regarding your membership, and associated offers, by e-mail (we may disclose to entities in the USA & Singapore).
  3. Where you communicate with us by e-mail, and where we communicate about you, your membership, your insurance policy, or your loan (we may disclose to entities in the USA).



We may store your information in cloud or other types of networked or electronic storage.  As electronic or networked storage can be accessed from various countries via an internet connection, it’s not always practicable to know in which country your information may be held.  If your information is stored in this way, disclosures may occur in countries other than those listed.

Overseas organisations may be required to disclose information we share with them under a foreign law. In those instances, we will not be responsible for that disclosure. 

### Accessing your personal information

If you request it, we will provide you a summary of any personal information held about you in accordance with our obligations under The Privacy Act.  If you request detailed information, RACQ may charge a fee for the retrieval of this information.

Any requests for information will be processed within a reasonable timeframe (usually within 10 business days).  If the retrieval of information involves accessing archived information and will take longer than normal, we will endeavour to provide you with an estimated timeframe.  
Under some circumstances, we may refuse you access to personal information where denying access is required or authorised by law, for example if access would pose a threat to life or the health of anyone, where the request for access is regarded as frivolous or vexatious, or where information relates to anticipated or legal proceedings.  If you are denied access to your information, we will explain why.

### How we keep your information up to date

We will take reasonable steps to ensure that your personal information is accurate and up to date and we will correct this as soon as we know otherwise.  You have the right to ask us to correct your information.  If you learn that your information needs to be updated, you should contact us as soon as possible and we will process your request.  If we refuse to correct your information, we will explain why in writing, and advise you of the mechanisms available to you to complain.  You also have a right for a statement to be attached to your personal information if RACQ disagrees with your request to correct the information held.

### Changes to this policy

The RACQ Group constantly reviews its policies, statements and procedures to keep up to date with relevant legislation. As a result we may update and change this Privacy Policy as directed by law. Any changes will be updated on our website. If you have a concern or query about this process and how it may affect you, please contact us at [privacy@racq.com.au](mailto:privacy@racq.com.au?subject=Privacy).
