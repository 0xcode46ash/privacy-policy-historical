 Privacy Policy
Our privacy statement sets out our practices for the collection and use of information from our web sites and
the circumstances in which we may record and/or monitor telephone calls.

     •    IP addresses
How Secure is the Information we Collect?
We try our best to follow good industry practice to prevent the loss, misuse and alteration of the information
under our control. All financial information is encrypted during transmission, and our company databases
are accessible only to internal employees.
What do we use this Information for?

                    site and to allow us to tailor content or advertisements to match your preferred interest or
