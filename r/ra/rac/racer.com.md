# Privacy Policy | Racer.com

**General Information**

Racer.com is dedicated to providing racing news and stories for enthusiasts from around the world. Individuals sign up and create a personal profile to immediately interact, communicate and connect with other community members through posting and commenting. We value the privacy of our members so only basic profile information is displayed to allow members to identify each other. Members can update and change their personal profile information at anytime.

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**

Racer.com collects personal information from you when you register and complete your profile. This includes your real name, address, and email address. You may provide Racer.com additional non-identifying information when you subscribe to various types of content, such as demographic information about yourself and your interests. Any information you post in discussions, blogs, comments, or other publicly accessible pages may be viewed by others.

Racer.com also records non-identifying information automatically supplied by your web browser while using its sites, including IP address, advertising cookies, and the page or search query requested. Racer.com uses this information to monitor and analyze use of its sites, customize the content and advertising you see, and improve its services.

Some content and advertisements displayed at Racer.com may originate from other servers not under Racer.com’s control, and this policy does not apply to that material. This policy also does not apply when you follow a link to web sites not under Racer.com’s control.

Racer.com will not sell, rent, or disclose your personally identifying information without your permission except as follows. Certain Racer.com promotions are developed in coordination with one or more partners, for example, a company that offers content of particular interest to users. We share information in your profile with our partner(s) for that specific community. Racer.com members have the opportunity to participate in surveys, quizzes, polls and contests, in exchange for which sponsors may offer promotional consideration. If you choose to participate, the information entered will be supplied to the sponsor(s). We may disclose information in response to a subpoena, search warrant, court order, legal process, or other governmental requirements. Racer.com may disclose such information it in good faith believes necessary to protect and defend its rights and property; to protect against misuse, or unauthorized or illegal use of our site, or use intended to perpetrate fraud; and to protect the personal safety or property of its users or the public. We will transfer information if we are acquired by or merged with another company, at which time this policy may change or may not longer apply.

We may share information that is not personally identifying, such as your interests and usage of the site, for purposes such as customizing content and advertising, and reporting to sponsors.

**Updating Information and Security**

You may update your profile information for Racer.com at any time. If you delete a profile, some historical information may remain in our records for an indefinite period, and we may or may not remove your posts from the community. To prevent others from changing your profile without your permission, you should maintain the confidentiality of your password. Racer.com takes reasonable measures to limit access to personal information, but cannot guarantee security.

**Policy Changes and Contact Information**

Racer.com may update this policy at any time, and the changed policy will be made available on our site. By using the site, you signify your acceptance of the revised policy. We encourage you to periodically review this policy so you know how we are protecting your information. If Racer.com makes a significant or material change in how we disclose personally identifying information, we will post a more prominent notice on the site or notify you via the email address in your profile.

If you have any questions or suggestions about this policy, or believe it may have been violated, please write us at [webmaster@haymarketnetworkusa.com](mailto:webmaster@haymarketnetworkusa.com).
