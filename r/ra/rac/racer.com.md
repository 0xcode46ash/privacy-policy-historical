Racer Media & Marketing, Inc. ("Racer") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to protect your privacy and to fully disclose what information we collect and how we use it. Please note your use of our Digital Offering is also governed by the Terms of Use.

  
PLEASE READ THIS PRIVACY POLICY CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR WEBSITE OR DIGITAL OFFERING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTAND, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND TO ALL THE TERMS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND OUR TERMS OF USE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE TERMS, EXIT THIS PAGE AND DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE OR DIGITAL OFFERING.

**Information Collection and Dissemination**

**General Principles**

  * In general, you may visit this Digital Offering or use the companion mobile applications (collectively referred to as the "Digital Offering") without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.
  * As you browse our Digital Offering, the Digital Offering collects log file, IP address of your computer, and other standard tracking data we use to evaluate Digital Offering traffic and usage patterns. Such information is aggregated with tracking data from all Digital Offering visitors. We may use the information to personalize the Digital Offering according to your preferences based on the aggregated information. We may also use the aggregated information to evaluate products and services we may offer to you.
  * Some portions of this Digital Offering may require you to give us personally identifiable information such as your name, job title, company, physical mailing address, e-mail address, telephone and fax numbers (Personal Information) and, if applicable, financial information such as your credit card information (Financial Information), for, without limitation, subscriptions to our publications and other products. If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys or contest entries, any information provided in such communications may be collected as Personal Information. It is optional for you to engage in an activity that requires you to provide Personal Information or Financial Information; however, if you do not provide the required Personal Information or Financial Information, you will not be able to engage in such activity.
  * If you elect to provide us Personal Information, we use it primarily to deliver the service you requested. Other uses of Personal Information are described elsewhere in this Policy.
  * If you submit Financial Information, we use that information primarily to verify your credit and collect payments for your purchases, orders, registrations, etc.
  * Racer uses a third party to process credit card transactions and does not store Financial Information, such as credit card information on its website. We do retain the last four digits of the credit card number solely for customer service purposes.
  * Racer uses third-party vendors to deliver its Digital Offering so your Personal Information may be shared with them to the extent necessary to deliver the service requested.
  * You may review and request changes to your Personal information at any time by sending an email to [webmaster@racer.com.](mailto:webmaster@racer.com.)



**Information Sharing**

Unless you opt-out, we may share your Personal Information with Racer's affiliates and partners and third parties licensed to access your Personal Information by any of the foregoing. To opt-out, send us an email to [webmaster@racer.com](mailto:webmaster@racer.com)  
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your Personal Information and your Financial Information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with a court order or other legal process; (b) protect our rights or property; or (c) enforce our terms of service.

Several companies unaffiliated with Racer provide email deployment services for our email messages. We provide Personal Information, such as e-mail addresses, to these vendors for the purposes of e-mail deployment; such Personal Information is only used by them for that purpose and not for any other business activity.

In order to comply with the Federal CAN-SPAM Act of 2003, we also may provide lists of customers who have opted-out of email promotion for Racer products to other companies, so they can be suppressed from mailings those companies on Racer’s behalf. In addition, if you unsubscribe from a mailing we send to our own mailing list on behalf of a third party, your removal instruction may also be supplied to the third party and added to their own suppression file. If you continue receiving email after opting out, please contact us at [webmaster@racer.com.](mailto:webmaster@racer.com.)
