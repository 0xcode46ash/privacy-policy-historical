Raymour & Flanigan Furniture respects your privacy. Our goal is to be your furniture retailer of choice by developing a relationship based on mutual trust. Personal information which you choose to share with Raymour & Flanigan will be treated in accordance with the following policies: 

**Your Transmission of Personal Data Is Secure.**

When we ask you to send us information that needs to be protected (Social Security numbers, account numbers, etc.), we utilize a technology called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer). This technology encrypts information before it is sent across the Internet. The encrypted information is only decoded after it reaches the secure Raymour & Flanigan site. 

It is our policy not to ask you to send any sensitive information via e-mail, because e-mail is not a secure form of communication. 

**We Collect the Least Amount of Information about You as Possible.**

Please be assured we will only ask for information required to enhance your furniture-shopping experience. If you elect to sign up for updates and newsletters, we only need your e-mail address. However, we will ask for your name, **as an option** , so that we may personalize the correspondence we send. 

Raymour & Flanigan will not sell, barter, or exchange any information about you with another company or service. 

Raymour & Flanigan may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our user agreements, or (iii) protect the rights, property, or safety of Raymour & Flanigan, our users, or others. 

You may remove your name from our e-mail list by selecting "Unsubscribe" in the [become a Raymour & Flanigan member](https://web.archive.org/web/20021014223623id_/http%3A//www.raymourflanigan.com/submembers.htm) section.

If you do not want to accept cookies, you can accomplish this by changing the settings of your browser. 

**You Will Know in Advance if Our Policy Changes.**

While we do not foresee the need to change any of our privacy policies, should we feel the need to do so, we will post the revised policy at least thirty days prior to the effective date so that you always know what information we collect and how we use it.

**Delivery Policy - Guaranteed On-Time Delivery!**

Raymour & Flanigan understands that your busy lifestyle places many demands on your time. As you juggle the priorities in your day, we are there to help make your choice of furniture delivery from Raymour & Flanigan a timely experience.

We Guarantee On-Time Delivery within a pre-identified delivery window. You will be contacted by a Customer Service Agent one to two days prior to your delivery and will be provided a delivery time window. If Raymour & Flanigan arrives after this window, we will refund your delivery charge in the form of a gift certificate.

Guaranteed On-Time Delivery is applicable Tuesday through Friday only. You must be home during the delivery window and ready to receive your delivery. Your home must be ready to receive your new furniture. The Raymour & Flanigan delivery team can not move existing furniture to other rooms in your home. This is a critical courtesy in meeting the time needs of all customers waiting for their delivery that day.

We appreciate your understanding that significant acts of nature, and our concern for the safety of the delivery teams and the public will cancel this program for that day. No refunds will be made.

**Return Policy**

Raymour & Flanigan Furniture wants you to be completely satisfied with your purchase. Orders may be canceled with no penalty prior to receiving your delivery confirmation phone call from the Regional Customer Service Center. This will happen one to two days prior to delivery.

Once your delivery date has been confirmed, your furniture is transferred from our Distribution Center to the Regional Customer Service Center in your area for preparation and delivery. After this date, the delivery charge is non-refundable.

Once your furniture has been delivered, service related issues can be handled by visiting our online Customer Service Center, or by calling your Regional Customer Service Center. You can find the phone number for your Customer Service Center on the order confirmation email you will receive, or by selecting a nearby store in our Showroom Locator.

Any non-service related issue can be addressed by visiting one of our conveniently located showrooms.

**Lifetime Service Pledge**

We will provide in-home refinishing and upholstery service for a period of one year from the original delivery date. This service will restore your furniture to its original quality on any manufacturing defect, provided it is not normal wear or customer-caused.

We will uphold all manufacturer warranties which cover beyond the initial one-year time frame.

Necessary exchanges due to manufacturing defect will be conducted free of charge within 90 days of the original delivery.

We are committed to meeting your service needs beyond the duration of any product warranties. Our time and material service rates are significantly below industry standards.
