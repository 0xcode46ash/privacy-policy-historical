# Raytheon: Legal - Privacy Policy

**EFFECTIVE DATE: NOVEMBER 10, 2015.**

This Privacy Policy applies to any visitor or user (hereinafter referred to as “You”) of the website located at [www.raytheon.com](http://www.raytheon.com/), [www.mathalive.com](http://www.mathalive.com/), [www.mathalive-me.com](http://www.mathalive-me.com/), and any websites (singularly and collectively, “the Site”) that Raytheon Company or its subsidiaries and affiliates (singularly and collectively, “Raytheon”) own and control, except those that maintain a separate Privacy Policy (such as [www.raytheoncyber.com](http://www.raytheoncyber.com/)).

Raytheon is sensitive to the issue of confidentiality in online dealings and is committed to transparency regarding its protection of individual privacy. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users about the general approach Raytheon uses in collecting, using and disseminating user information via the Site.

Additionally, as the Site includes [www.mathalive.com](http://www.mathalive.com/) and [ww.mathalive-me.com](http://www.mathalive-me.com/), websites that provide information about Raytheon’s MathAlive! exhibits, the Site may be of interest to children under the age of 13 years old (taken together, these three sites constitute the “Children’s Sites”). We are committed to complying fully with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Our information collection policy is described below. Parents of children who are under the age of 13 should ensure that they understand our policies regarding personal information before entering any personally identifiable information on or through the Children’s Sites.

**1\. What Personally Identifiable Information May Be Collected?**

1.1 At Raytheon, it is our policy to create website content that encourages visitors to feel that their privacy is respected in sharing information with us and allows us to understand our visitors as described in this policy. We may request personally identifiable information from you including, but not limited to, your name, home address, email address and/or telephone number, when you interact with the Site, such as to respond to your requests or to enable you to register to use certain features of this Site. We take special precautions and have implemented additional privacy safeguards when we collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. For more information about how we handle children’s information, please see the “Children’s Privacy” section below.

1.2 When we do collect personally identifiable information, we will use it for the purposes indicated in this policy.

1.3 Our Site may provide links to other websites that may have their own information collection practices. To the extent that you provide personally identifiable information to websites that link to or from our Site, different rules may apply to the use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information. To the extent that the Site includes third-party advertisements, the privacy policy of the advertiser providing the advertisement will govern the use of your personally identifiable information collected during your access to the advertisement. Raytheon does not control linking practices of advertisers or sponsors and does not monitor or claim responsibility for any content or privacy practices of such websites. Once you have left our Site, you must read the privacy policy of the advertiser or sponsor to see how your personally identifiable information will be handled.

1.4 On occasion, Raytheon may use an advertising server developed by a third party to display ads on our Site. Some of these ads may contain cookies that are set by third parties (advertisers, sponsors). We do not have access to these cookies or any information that they contain. This Privacy Policy does not cover any use of information that a third-party ad server may have collected from you.

1.5 Raytheon may use the Site as an entry into other networked web pages and websites operated by Raytheon and its subsidiaries and affiliates (together, the "Transaction Sites"), exclusive of the Children’s Sites, for which this section does not apply. Please note that individual Transaction Sites may adopt privacy terms particular to the purpose of such Transaction Site or the transaction(s) taking place on such Transaction Site. As Transaction Sites are generally affiliated with commercial transactions that you or your business may have with Raytheon, particularly those which are password-protected or are subject to subscriptions, the privacy terms for such sites may differ through terms in separate agreements which may supplement or supersede these terms.

**2\. Other Types of Information That May Be Collected**

2.1 IP Addresses

An Internet protocol address, or IP address, is automatically assigned to your computer when you access the Internet, and is used by web servers to identify your computer. When you access our Site, we may log your IP address, however, your identity will remain anonymous to us. We log the IP addresses for system administration and for auditing the use of our Site. We may also use IP addresses to collect statistical information for marketing and other purposes.

2.2 Cookies or Tracers

From time to time, we may place information on your computer to allow us to identify you. This information is known as a “cookie.” We use cookies to view information about your activities on our Site, such as your preferences or which pages you have visited on the Site. A cookie will not allow our Site to learn any personally identifiable information that you have not otherwise disclosed (except as described below). By understanding how and when our visitors use the Site, we can continually improve our Site, as well as our products and services. If you wish to disable cookies, your browser may have controls that allow you to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent.

In some instances, we use tracking scripts or "tracers" that recognize a unique identifier from a cookie placed on your hard drive by another website. These are used by Raytheon solely to gauge the success of our own advertising. For instance, we may use a tracer to determine whether you visit our employment pages after visiting a resume or career site where Raytheon placed a banner ad. We do not use tracers to gather information on your use of the Internet unrelated to Raytheon. Please note that Raytheon does not use tracers to determine your personally identifiable information, and you remain anonymous unless you choose to provide personally identifiable information.

2.3 Web Beacons

Web beacons are small files that we may place on our Site, which count the number of unique users that have visited a specific page on the Site and the number of times a given page has been displayed. This information is collected only in the aggregate and is generally not linked to any personally identifiable information (except as described below).

2.4 What Happens if I Register?

Registration may be allowed or required on the Site. Taken together, the provisions set forth in this Privacy Policy, the Terms and Conditions of Use for the Site, and any additional conditions presented to you upon registration detail the applicable conditions governing the use of information provided during registration. In addition to the uses described above, Raytheon may collect registration data in order to monitor compliance with this Privacy Policy and to set up access permissions to certain other pages on the Site.

2.5 Do-Not-Track

Our information collection practices will continue to operate as described in this Privacy Policy independent of any “do-not-track” choice you make.

**3\. Use of Information**

3.1 Use and Sharing of Information

Raytheon and its affiliates may use and disclose your personally identifiable information only as set forth herein, except where the terms of a separate privacy policy apply. 

Generally, your personally identifiable information will not be given out to third parties not affiliated with Raytheon. From time to time we may transfer, disclose or share your personally identifiable information with third parties who may be engaged by us specifically to handle and deliver certain online activities, including, but not limited to, conducting contests and sweepstakes. Such parties will have access to your personally identifiable information needed to perform these functions, but we do not allow them to use it for other purposes.

Anonymous data collected using cookies and web beacons may be analyzed in the aggregate to determine collective user characteristics, to understand user traffic patterns, sales information and user behavior on the Site. Such information also may be shared in the aggregate with third parties for advertising purposes, to enhance our Site, to enhance our products and services, and to analyze how and where best to use our resources.

3.2 Monitoring and Compliance

Although Raytheon is under no obligation to monitor the Site, we may monitor, store, review and disclose to third parties any information, including your personally identifiable information, obtained on or through the Site as may be needed or requested to satisfy any applicable governmental law, regulation, investigation or proceeding. Raytheon may also disclose your personally identifiable information (1) where such disclosure is required by law; (2) to protect Raytheon’s legal rights to the extent authorized or permitted by law; or (3) in an emergency where the health or safety of you or another individual may be endangered. Additionally, we may use IP addresses to identify a particular user if we believe it is needed to enforce compliance with these terms or to protect our company, employees, Site, or customers.

Raytheon may transfer personally identifiable information in connection with the sale of one or more of our businesses or subsidiaries to a different company that agrees to offer equivalent safeguards for the use and disclosure of such information.

**4\. Security of Personally Identifiable Information**

4.1 While Raytheon makes every effort to prevent third party, non-affiliate access to personally identifiable information, you should keep in mind that data transmission over the Internet is not 100% secure and any information disclosed online can potentially be collected and used other than by the intended recipient. In view of the foregoing, Raytheon cannot warrant that your personally identifiable information will not be disclosed to or accessed by parties other than those authorized under this Privacy Policy.

[](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604213254id_/http%3A//legal/privacy_policy/index.html#top)

**5.Your Privacy Choices / Updates to Your Information**

5.1 At your request, Raytheon will make reasonable efforts to update, change or delete any personally identifiable information you have provided via the Site. In order to enforce the terms of this Privacy Policy, resolve disputes, or provide information to satisfy applicable governmental laws, regulations, investigations or proceedings, we may need to retain your personally identifiable information in our files. Additionally, your personally identifiable information may be retained in residual back-up files that are a function of our network’s back-up systems.

5.2 If you do not want Raytheon to use your personally identifiable information to contact you for marketing or solicitation purposes, please click the opt-out link on the email you received or contact us via e-mail at [PrivacyPolicy@Raytheon.com](mailto:PrivacyPolicy@Raytheon.com). When writing to us, please specify if you would prefer that we use a different email or communication method. Keep in mind that restricting contact methods may make it more difficult for us to keep you informed about new products, services and websites that can be of benefit to you. These choices do not apply to transactional or relationship emails or the display of online advertising. You can revoke these options at any time by contacting us using one of the methods provided.

**6\. Children’s Privacy**

6.1 Raytheon encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children. We urge parents to instruct their children never to give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers without the permission of a parent or guardian, when using the Internet. We do not collect or use personally identifiable information in connection with [www.mathalive.com](http://www.mathalive.com/) or [www.mathalive-me.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20160604213254id_/http%3A//www.raytheon.com/legal/privacy_policy). We fully comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which requires us take special precautions when collecting personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. 

6.2 In compliance with COPPA, we have adopted the following policies to keep children safe. 

A. Personally identifiable information we collect from children under the age of 13 will be used solely by Raytheon or its agents for internal purposes only and will not be sold or otherwise distributed to third parties. 

B. We will not knowingly allow children under the age of 13 to access any social media site that may exist on the Site, email accounts, or other services within Raytheon that would allow them to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable information. 

C. We will not knowingly ask a child under the age of 13 to divulge more information than is needed to participate in any activity, game, or service. 

D. We will not knowingly keep any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's email submission, help inquiry, or other one-time request, if we know that the child is under the age of 13. Information will be automatically purged or purged immediately after the issue has been resolved. 

E. We will not knowingly post any personally identifiable information that is inadvertently included in a child's submission to a general audience contribution area if we know that the child is under the age of 13. These submissions will be deleted and handled anonymously thereafter. 

F. We will not knowingly provide any direct link to websites that are unsuitable for children or teens. 

G. Upon request, we will provide a parent or guardian with a description of the information that may have been provided about their child during a registration process for a program, service or contest on the Site.

6.3 Consistent with COPPA, there are few instances where we will collect information from children, such as: 

A. Requesting the contact information of a parent or guardian for the sole purpose of providing notification to the parent or guardian; 

B. Collecting children’s contact information on a one-time basis, such as when they enter a contest or ask Raytheon a question using the “contact us” link on our Sites. We will use this information on a one-time basis solely to directly respond to the child’s request. We will purge the child’s contact information from our systems when we have fulfilled the request, such as after we respond to the child’s email or when a contest is over. We will not use children’s information to re-contact them or for any other purpose other than fulfilling their requests;

C. Collecting a child's contact information and the contact information of his/her parent or guardian solely to directly respond more than once to a specific request from the child (for example, to satisfy the request for a newsletter subscription). In this instance, the parent or guardian will be notified that the child made such a request and be informed of the information provided by the child. The parent or guardian will have an opportunity at any time to revoke the child's request (i.e., unsubscribe). We will not use the child's personal information to re-contact the child for any other purpose; and

D. Using cookies to collect non-personally-identifiable information on our child-directed Sites for analytics and internal operations purposes.

7.1 California’s “Shine the Light” law permits California residents to annually request and obtain information free of charge about what personal information is disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. Raytheon does not distribute your personal information to outside parties for their direct marketing, or any other purpose, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy, without your consent.

While we identify sponsor and advertiser areas of our Site, we do not control these cookies or the content of these third parties.

8.3 Once you leave our servers (you can generally tell where you are by checking the URL in the location bar on your browser), the use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting. That policy may differ from ours.
