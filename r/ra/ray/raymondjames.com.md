### PRIVACY NOTICE TO RAYMOND JAMES CLIENTS

Raymond James is committed to protecting confidentiality of the information furnished to us by our clients. We are providing you this information as required by Regulation S-P adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

We collect nonpublic personal information about clients from the following sources:
