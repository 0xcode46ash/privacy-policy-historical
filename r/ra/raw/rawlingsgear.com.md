### Customer Care Help Center: Privacy Policy

  
  


#### Privacy Policy

Rawlings is committed to protecting your privacy and has created this statement to outline our approach in this regard. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for our web site (www.RawlingsGear.com). If you have any concerns, comments or complaints, please feel free to email us at [service@Rawlings.com](mailto:service@Rawlings.com "email customer care")

#### Information We Collect...

Rawlings collects general information as you browse our site to help us diagnose problems with our server, administer our web site, and analyze broad demographic information about our visitors. The following information is obtained: 

  * IP Address - We use IP addresses to measure site traffic and help provide relevant shopping experiences. Your IP address is not linked to your customer information.
  * Referral Site - If you visit our site via a link, the location of the referral is captured. This information helps us determine where our customers come from.
  * Browser Type - This information is captured to help optimize our site to match the latest technology used by our customers.
  * Movements through our site - We keep track of the pages you visit to help us provide a more personalized and relevant shopping experience.



In addition, our site uses an order form for customers to request products. This order form allows us to obtain contact (email, address, and phone number) and payment information (credit card number). This information is used to confirm your order and respond to any questions you may have. Where required, we also share this information with certain intermediaries (UPS, USPS, Rawlings Sporting Goods Inc.) strictly to process and ship your order. We do not sell, rent, or loan customer information to any third parties. We do reserve the right to sell customer data in conjunction with a sale of the company or any of its assets. 

Rawlings allows customers to maintain a Customer Profile to aid in the input of future orders. The Customer Profile contains contact information only; we do not maintain payment information in our customer database. This optional feature is available during the order process. You may change the information in your Customer Profile at any time by visiting the [Edit Customer Profile](https://web.archive.org/web/20150609053919id_/http%3A//customer/login.asp "go to edit cusotmer profile") page. 

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Website. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). 

Lastly, to improve our services, we may from time to time request some of our customers to complete a voluntary survey. Survey answers are confidential. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline participation when asked. 

#### Correspondence From Us...

To keep you informed about our latest offers, we may notify you of exclusive Rawlings promotions, specials, and new additions to our web site. 

Our customers may choose to be removed from our mailing list and to cease receiving all communications from us at any time. There are two ways to be removed from our database:
