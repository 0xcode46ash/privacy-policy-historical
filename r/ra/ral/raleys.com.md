**Opt-out for Quality of Life Card**

On our Quality of Life Card webpage, we provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifying information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from our Quality of Life Card program, you can indicate your preference on our Quality of Life Card webpage.

**Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to enhance the experience of our customers on our web sites.

We do not link this automatically collected data to personally identifying information.

**Cookies and Other Computer Information**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. Visitors to the web site are sent anonymous cookies to keep track of their browsing patterns and build up a demographic profile.

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser.

In addition, a user who has clicked on a raleys.com advertisement on another web site that links to raleys.com may be sent a persistent cookie that allows us to analyze advertising effectiveness and manage our relationship with the referring web site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

Persistent cookies are used to customize the content of certain sections of the web site and enable us to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our web site. For example, we may set a persistent cookie to store your preferred store locations for weekly ads and promotions, so you don’t have to enter it more than once.

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as weekly ads, will be limited.

We also collect certain technical information from your computer each time you request a page during a visit to raleys.com. This information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring web site, if any. We collect this information to enhance the quality of your experience during your visit to the web site.

We also contract with third parties to provide us with: data collection and reporting services regarding our customers' activities on the web site; tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. These third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on the web site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used to serve ads to you, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies.

**Links to Other Sites**

This web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Raley’s and its affiliated companies. Please be aware that we, Raley’s and its affiliated companies, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifying information. For example, you have left our web sites when you click on the links to UNICRU, e-cart, Upromise, Healthnotes, Diabetes Center, our community calendar links and other similar links.

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by us from the raleys.com and nobhill.com web sites.

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number) on our order or job application forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL, your personally identifying information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

Your personally identifying information is protected by the password you created when you completed the registration form at raleys.com or by another password you created after changing a previous password. Keep your password confidential. No representative of Raley’s will ever ask you for your password.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. But no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our web site, you can send an email to us at webmaster@raleys.com.

**Business Transitions**

In the event Raley’s or its affiliates go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your personally identifying information will likely be among the assets transferred.

**Changes in this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here.

**Contact Us**

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at webmaster@raleys.com.

Effective Date: This privacy policy was last updated on January 27, 2009. Please check our privacy policy periodically for changes.
