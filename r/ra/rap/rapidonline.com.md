The Statement explains how we will treat any personal information that you provide to us when you use this site. It also outlines some of the security measures that we take in order to protect your privacy and gives certain assurances on things we will not do.

The information we collect and how we use it

We gather this information to allow us to process your registration and to send you promotional material and catalogues where requested, as well as using it to develop and improve our services.

We may use aggregated information for the purposes of tracking the usage of our services and in order to help us develop and improve the website and such services. We may pass this information to third parties. The aggregated information and statistics will not, however, include details that can be used to identify you.

We (directly or through our trusted affiliates) would also like to provide you, from time to time, with information by e-mail about other Rapid Electronics services and products, which we think may be of interest to you.
