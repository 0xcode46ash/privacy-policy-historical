### Scope:

TowerData helps our business clients develop better relationships with their customers. We believe in the power of transparency, choice, and control when it comes to personal information online. We view privacy and security as fundamental design requirements in our technologies and services and core to our business practices and operations.

This Privacy Statement applies to data collected through all websites and domains maintained by TowerData including TowerData.com, www.TowerData.com, and www.TowerData.com (collectively, "the Websites"). The purpose of this privacy policy is to help you understand what information we collect and how we use it. We also provide an option for you to [opt-out](https://dashboard.towerdata.com/optout/) of the TowerData database if you choose to.

### Definitions:

TowerData collects personal information from a variety of sources including the TowerData Website and stores it in the "TowerData Database."

TowerData data is structured around individual email addresses and contain personally and non-personally identifiable information.

### Collection And Use Of Personal Information

When you visit the TowerData Websites, we may collect information from you. The information we gather falls into two categories: 1) personal information you voluntarily supply when you log into our Websites (such as first name and email) and 2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites.

Personal Information: We may collect personally identifiable information you provide to us directly. TowerData permits any visitor to the TowerData Websites to access and edit the information we have stored in your TowerData report. We use the information you provide us to update your TowerData report and distribute it as part of the TowerData Database. At the TowerData Blog (www.TowerData.com) you can submit your email address to receive blog updates and you can leave comments. Information from these two sources is not used by TowerData for any other purpose than proper administration of the blog and the email list and not disclosed to third parties.

Tracking Information: We may use industry standard technologies to track your use of our website and tailor your web experience.

Cookies are small unique strings of letters and numbers that are stored on your computer to make it easier for you to use our site and for us to improve site functionality and improve security. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them).

When you visit our TowerData.com web site (or other web sites that we operate), or open an email you have received from us, we or one of our ad partners may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser.  These cookies enable us to send you ads about our services, customize our services and gather analytics about our web traffic.  Additionally, emails we send to you may contain a bit of code known as a "web beacon."  This code allows us to understand the time and date of when a user has opened an email and when he/she has utilized a link within the email to visit a website, allowing us to collect analytics about our traffic, customize our services, and send you ads about our services.  Users wishing to disable our web beacons should do so by turning images "off" in their email client (e.g., Outlook, Outlook Express). Please see your email client for more information.

We may also use cookies to automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the TowerData Websites and automatically store it in log files. This may include the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address.

Your browser may permit you to reject or delete cookies, but this may prevent proper working of our website. If you want to opt-out of receiving some advertising cookies, you may be able to do so by visiting <http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp>.
