**Who Should Read This Statement**

The following privacy statement addresses potential questions, concerns, and/or interests of four different types of people or groups:

  1. Data Subjects: People with Rapleaf profiles.
  2. Users: People who visit one of our web sites or use our services.
  3. Members: People who have signed-up with Rapleaf to manage their online reputations and privacy.
  4. Customers: Organizations who take advantage of Rapleaf’s services to learn more about their users or consumers.



A “data subject” is any person with a profile on Rapleaf. Profiles are created when a user, member, or customer provides an email address to us. For example, if you search your own email address in our system, you are both a data subject and a user. If you search a friend’s email address, then he becomes a data subject and you are a user.

“Users” are individual users of the Internet who come to Rapleaf and enter an email address into our system or who have made use of Upscoop to find their contacts on various social networking sites.

Our “members” are people who have registered with us to use our innovative tools and services to establish trusted relationships with the people with whom they meet and interact, to enhance and control their online reputations, to better connect with friends and business associates, and to control the profiles about themselves that we disclose to others.

Rapleaf’s “customers” are organizations and companies seeking new ways to reach and/or learn more about their own users, subscribers, consumers, etc. We provide our customers with information on our data subjects to gain meaningful insights into their consumers and users for the purpose of improving and/or personalizing their own products and services.

**Personal Information**

Rapleaf collects several types of personal and non-personal information either directly from you, as a user or member of our online services, and/or from another user, member, or business customer. These can be described as follows:

_Personal Information_

We define “personal information” as information that can be used to uniquely identify you or that you may consider sensitive. Most of the information we index comes from openly available sources on the web, including forums, review sites, social networks, commerce sites, message boards, and other sites where individuals post information about themselves. We collect such information when you use or someone with your email address uses our email search service, register and use our service as an individual member, or use our mass lookup service to find your friends on various social networks based on your address book. We may also gather personal information about you from our business customers when they provide us with a list of their users’ email addresses to process.

The specific types of personal information that we collect include: email addresses, profile URLs, usernames or screen names, first and last names, addresses, and phone numbers. A profile URL is the specific web address to a person’s profile on a social networking site or commerce site, for example.

Our systems and database are structured around individual email addresses. Rapleaf’s users, members, and business customers provide email addresses to use our products and services. We hold these email addresses in confidence and do not rent, sell, or lease these email addresses to third parties.

_Non-Personal Information_

Our definition of “non-personal information” is information related to you but that cannot be used to personally identify you. We obtain non-personal information about you when you provide it to us, either separately or together with your personal information, when you access our site, or when you or another person initiates a search about you via our site. We may also obtain this information from other open web sites or when a business customer provides it to us.

We collect the following types of non-personal information: demographic (e.g., age, gender), psychographic (e.g., interests), and sociographic (e.g., social networking relationships, social networks used). This information also includes non-personal information that we gather as you navigate our website. We log this information when you visit and browse our website. We record details such as browser types, domains, statistics of your visit including page views, and time spent on the website. We use this information to improve our services for you and to our customers.

We do not knowingly collect information about your religion, finance, health, or sexual preference, nor do we knowingly collect information about children. We view these types of information as sensitive and understand they require additional protections under various laws. We encourage you to take extra precautions in posting sensitive personal information via openly available web sites, as this data could be used in ways you may not anticipate or desire. It is your responsibility to review web sites’ privacy policies and set the appropriate profile settings available to you before posting sensitive information online.

**Uses of Personal Information**

We use personal and non-personal information to provide our services to our users, members, and customers, as described below.  
_  
Uses of Information About Data Subjects_

For people who have a Rapleaf profile but who have not visited our site, searched for someone via our site, nor used Upscoop, your profile page is the result of having been the subject of a search initiated by a Rapleaf user, member, or business customer. We use the personal and non-personal information collected about you as a result of that search to respond to the initial search, as well as to respond to any future searches initiated by via our site.

The value of having a Rapleaf profile is in its ability to aggregate your profiles on disparate web sites and amplify your visibility and accessibility for others online. We seek to promote your good name, enhance other people’s trust in interacting with you, and make it easier for your friends and associates to find you online. We encourage you to consider becoming a member. If, however, you are not interested in maintaining this profile page, then you can opt-out of Rapleaf. (See Your Choices and Privacy Preferences below for more information.)

_Uses of Information About Users_

As an individual Internet user, we provide you with (1) a service to search for reputation and other information about people with whom you are communicating, interacting, transacting, or interested in learning about in general, and (2) a service called Upscoop to upload your email address book and find your contacts on major social networking sites and online communities.

By entering an email address into our search box via Rapleaf.com, we use the address to search our system and openly available sources to then provide you with additional personal and nonpersonal information associated with that address. Results may include demographic information (e.g., age, location), sociographic information (e.g., social networking memberships), a Rapleaf reputation score, an email domain reputation, a list of ratings submitted about the person, and an opportunity for you to register as a member and then rate the person. You may choose to use our service to search your own email addresses to see what personal information is openly available about you online and how we may score your reputation. In either case, we store email addresses and associated personal and non-personal information in Rapleaf profile pages displayed as a result of either user-initiated Rapleaf searches or Upscoop to respond to future searches initiated by other Rapleaf users, members, and business customers.

Upscoop.com is a social network mass lookup utility developed by Rapleaf. By entering your email login credentials within Upscoop, we search major social networks for the email addresses within your address book, and display which of your contacts are members of what social networks. The social networks displayed include the URLs or links to each contact’s social network profile. We do not store your email login credentials. However, we do collect and store email addresses and names of your contacts for use in other Rapleaf services. Additionally, information collected by Rapleaf may also be displayed on Upscoop for given email address book search results.

As a user, we may email you about our services, including special alerts, service-related announcements, offers, awards, surveys, contests, promotions, and updates. You are always given the option to not receive future communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of any Rapleaf email.

We use non-personal information to track and monitor aggregate usage of our website and for internal analysis, quality control, and improvements to our service. We collect such information by using cookies and other standard web technologies. (See Log Files and Cookies below for more information.)

Uses of Information About Members

As a Rapleaf member who has completed the sign-up process, we use your personal and non-personal information to: (1) respond to search requests made on our site about you; (2) assist you in managing your online reputation; (3) communicate with you from time to time; and (4) track your use of our site.

When a user, member, or customer initiates a search via Rapleaf based on your email address, we will display your membership profile. Results will include the specific personal and non-personal information you permit us to display within our system, along with your Rapleaf reputation score, email domain reputation, and the list of ratings submitted about you by your friends and colleagues. This same information is also provided to anyone who clicks on a Rapleaf badge you’ve displayed on your website or blog.

We use your personal information to communicate with you as a member, primarily via your registered email address. We communicate with you in accordance with your preferences and in response to your inquiries, to provide requested services, and to help you manage your account. In addition, you may choose to receive emails when you are rated by others or subscribe to our newsletter. We provide you with ways to unsubscribe from any of the above communications. (See Your Choices and Privacy Preferences below for more information.)

As a member, we may email you about our services, including special alerts, service-related announcements, offers, awards, surveys, contests, promotions, and updates. We opt our members into receiving communications from us. You are always given the option to not receive future communications from us by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the footer of any Rapleaf email.

We use non-personal information to track and monitor aggregate usage of our website and for internal analysis, quality control, and improvements to our service. We collect such information by using cookies and other standard web technologies. (See Log Files and Cookies below for more information.)

Information Uses About Customers

We collect, process, and provide personal and non-personal information to our business customers for use in enhancing their own products and services. Learning more about your interests, values, memberships, activities, and interactions online is increasingly relevant to maintaining the high-quality and personalized experience you value from the organizations, businesses, and technology providers you rely on today.

It is important to recognize that all kinds of organizations make use of online tools, sites, and resources to learn about you as an individual (i.e., user, customer, member, employee, merchant, student, voter). Our goal is to make this a cost-effective and practical process for our customers. By utilizing our pioneering and proprietary technology, these companies and organizations are now in a position to better understand their users and provide enhanced services.

Customers provide us with a list of email addresses to process. We search our database and open network sites for personal and non-personal information associated with these addresses and consolidate the results into profiles that can be used by our customers. Some examples of how our customers make use of our service include:

  * Improving communications with their users by crafting more relevant or timely messaging
  * Enhancing fraud prevention and authentication measures
  * Modifying their website’s user interface and controls



We ensure that information provided, processed, and reported to our customers is done so in a private and secure manner, and we actively work with our customers to ensure compliance with the policies and procedures they have set for privacy and security.

Information Uses for Ratings Submitted by Members

Historical and statistical information is obtained from ratings submitted by members. The ratings have a qualitative component in the form of comment/feedback, as well as a quantitative component as a score or point value. We aggregate historical, statistical, and other reputation-based information across all member accounts and we display this information in response to searches via Rapleaf.

Ratings are collected, surveyed, evaluated and scored within our system to assess the quality of comment/feedback. Our system uses a point system as an input to Rapleaf’s scoring algorithms. A point balance will be maintained for each data subject based upon the number and type of ratings on that particular individual. We may use or modify this information to add, adjust, or discontinue certain services or functionality and to enforce our policies and procedures, as set forth in our [Terms of Service](http://blog.rapleaf.com/tos/).

Along with a proprietary fraud management system, we allow any data subject to challenge comments made about him/her by emailing Rapleaf. We encourage data subjects who would like more control over their ratings to become Rapleaf members. However, anyone is welcome to email us with comments or corrections, which we will consider making on their behalf. Overall, we believe our challenge process promotes the development of the most accurate reputation information online.

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Rapleaf. We do not sell, rent, or lease email addresses to any outside third parties nor is it in our interests or those of our customers to see these email addresses used inappropriately to contact you.

Disclosure to Searched Sites

When we search for an email address either provided by a user, member, or business customer, our system first looks in our system to see what information we have associated with that address. For an email address not in our system, we search openly available web sites and create a profile page based on the results of those searches. As a result, web sites we search may cache or store that email address in their servers. Rapleaf assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection, and disclosure practices of any of these third party sites.

_Disclosure to Commercial Partners_

We may enter into commercial arrangements to enable partners to provide our service to their users and/or to provide you access to their products and services. As a result, we may share personal and non-personal information with these commercial partners. It is our policy to contractually limit sharing in these instances to only the information required to provide a service, provide notice, and we give you the opportunity to opt-out at any time.

_Disclosure to Service Providers_

We may use third party service providers for network, security, email, and hosting services for our system. Suppliers and service providers are required by contract to keep confidential the information received on behalf of Rapleaf and may not use it for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Rapleaf.

_Links to Third Party Sites_

We may provide links to third party websites not directly associated with Rapleaf. We do not provide these partnering sites with personal information on our users or members. We encourage you to review the privacy and security policies of any externally linked websites that may be accessed through our sites before you submit any personal information to them. Rapleaf assumes no responsibility or liability for the information, collection, and disclosure practices of any of these third party sites.

_Disclosure Required By Law_

Under certain circumstances personal information may be subject to disclosure pursuant to judicial or other government subpoenas, warrants, or orders. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will notify you with the contact information you have provided to us in advance unless doing so would violate the law or a court order.

Also, we ask that our members agree to not rate a child or knowingly use Rapleaf in any way to obtain information about a child. In the event that Rapleaf learns it has collected personal information belonging to someone under age of 13, Rapleaf will delete that information from our database. If you believe that we have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [privacy@rapleaf.com](mailto:privacy@rapleaf.com).

**Log Files and Cookies**

_Log Files_

This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, to control fraud, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.
