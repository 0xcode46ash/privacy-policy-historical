# Rapleaf Blog » Privacy Policy

Effective date: November 26, 2006  


**Introduction**

Rapleaf takes your privacy very seriously. It is our number one priority. We are committed to keeping your information safe and secure at any cost.

This privacy policy covers how, when, and why we collect, use, and share information about [members](http://blog.rapleaf.com/drafts/glossary/) and [nonmembers](http://blog.rapleaf.com/drafts/glossary/). Please read this policy carefully and review it often because it may change. 

**Overview**

  * -All members must select a unique username that is their public identity on the system. A username is not displayed with [personally identifiable information](http://blog.rapleaf.com/drafts/glossary/) unless a member is searched with an email address that is linked to the member’s account – that email address is then shared with the username.
  * -Members must complete a registration process that includes selecting a username and password. We will also collect personally identifiable information from our members during this process, including an email address (name is optional). Additional information may be entered after registration and activation.
  * -A member cannot automatically be registered in Rapleaf. The exception is if Rapleaf integrates with a partner site – members of the partner site could be automatically registered in Rapleaf. Also, a person may be added to Rapleaf as a nonmember if searched upon.
  * -We collect, compile and may display historical, statistical and aggregate information about our members’ use of our system by their username.
  * -We collect volunteered information from members towards other members and nonmembers in the form of a rating.
  * -We obtain publicly available information that may contribute to the overall reputation of a person or email. 
  * -We also use automatic means like [cookies](http://blog.rapleaf.com/drafts/glossary/) and log files to collect user information.
  * -Aggregate information that is gathered up across all member accounts is not shared together with personally identifiable information.
  * -We do not use or share personally identifiable information other than as described in this privacy statement. We may disclose such information as required by law or to protect the rights of third parties.
  * -We communicate with our members mainly by email. We do not give or sell email addresses to anyone for their marketing purposes.
  * -Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use our system nor are they to be rated.


  * -We secure information we collect using generally accepted industry standards.
  * -This privacy statement may change at any time and changes take effect when posted unless otherwise indicated.



**Usernames**

During registration, members must select a unique username that will be publicly tied to their use of our system. We do not share usernames together with personally identifiable information (such as an email address) unless someone searches using a specific email address. Searching an email address will display the username of a member if the email is linked to the member’s profile.

**Passwords**

****During registration, members must create a password. Passwords are used to secure member information and the integrity of the system. We only store a one-way encryption of member passwords which means passwords cannot be unencrypted by us. Our login page provides a way for members to obtain access to the system in case they lose or forget their password.

**Changing Preferences**

Members may access and change their registration information using the ‘My Rapleaf’ link at top right of the page or when you first page that is displayed after signing in.

Members may change their password, username, name, and any other communication preferences as set by our system. Members may access other information collected and processed about them and adjust the display settings. This includes the domain name of their email addresses on file as well other publicly available information

**Collection of Registration Information**

Users of our system must complete a registration process (registration is a manual process). We will collect personally identifiable information during this process that includes email address (name is optional). Registration information is kept private and secure and is not shared for marketing purposes. We use this information to process registrations, contact our users, and to provide our services. 

_Optional Reputation Information_

After an account is activated, a member can choose to enter additional information, such as phone number(s), additional email accounts, or the URL of blogs or websites that are managed. This information is completely voluntary and may be used to further establish a member’s reputation. 

**Adding Oneself to Rapleaf**

A member cannot automatically be registered with Rapleaf. The only exception to this rule is if a partner site integrates Rapleaf. All members of the partner site could automatically be registered in Rapleaf using the email address and username at the partner site.

Also, someone can be included in the system as a non-member if searched by another member. Rapleaf Team will leave an appropriate rating to the non-member as dictated by our reputation algorithm. Note – this is process is not registering the searched user.

**Collection of Ratings**

Historical and statistical information are obtained from ratings submitted by members. The ratings have a qualitative component in the form of comment/feedback, as well as a quantitative component as a score or point value. We will also aggregate historical, statistical, and other reputation information across all member accounts, and we store this information. 

Ratings are collected, surveyed, evaluated and scored by the system to assess the quality of comment/feedback. Along with our proprietary fraud system, we allow members to challenge comments made about them by emailing Rapleaf. This challenge process promotes the development of the most accurate member reputations.

Our system uses a Rapleaf score/point system. A point balance will be maintained for each member and non-member based upon the number and type of ratings on that particular individual. We may also use this information to add, adjust or discontinue certain services or functionality and to enforce our policies and procedures. 

Members and non-members may receive ratings from Rapleaf Team from time to time. These ratings will be based on actions that were performed with respect to the member/nonmember’s account.

**Collection of Other Reputation Related Information**

We are able to obtain and may display information on a person, email, or phone number from other sources that are at our discretion. The system may automatically take into account this information in calculating the member’s reputation score or Rapleaf score.

**Collection of Information Automatically**
