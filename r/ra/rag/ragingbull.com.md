We have put in place security systems designed to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information you provide to us. These systems are structured to deter and prevent hackers and others from accessing this information.

Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted to register for the Services and RagingBull.com does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personally identifiable information from persons under the age of 18.

** In the event you access websites operated by RagingBull.com (collectively the "RagingBull.com Websites") as well as any other websites Sherwood Ventures, LLC may launch from time to time the following additional provisions shall apply:**

** 12.1 What Information We Collect and Use**   
In addition to the information set forth in Section 2 above, Sherwood Ventures, LLC collects information from users at different points on our Sherwood Ventures, LLC Websites and through our software, as follows:   
**12.1.1 Registration** : In order to subscribe to RagingBull.com products and services, we require that you complete a registration form. This form may ask for contact information, such as name, address, email address, telephone number, company name, fax number and other basic contact information ("Registration Information"). After submitting your Registration Information, you can view and modify this information within the self-maintenance area of the RagingBull.com Websites. You agree to notify RagingBull.com of any change to your billing address within thirty (30) days of such change.   
**12.1.2. Orders and Requests** : When you subscribe to an RagingBull.com product or service, we request the appropriate billing information on our order form. This information includes your credit card number, expiration date and billing address ("Order Information"). Order Information is kept with your Registration Information in a database and will be retained for future purchases.   
**12.1.3. Partners** : Sherwood Ventures, LLC may enter into agreements with other companies that market software or services that either function similarly to RagingBull.com software or that enhance or extend RagingBull.com' functionality. Some of these may be third party products that may utilize components of RagingBull.com software. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to collect information about your sessions and your use of these third party products and share this information with these third parties.   
**12.1.4. Third Party Advertising Companies** : We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our RagingBull.com Websites. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.   
**12.1.5. Providers** : A provider is an entity that agrees to pay for the RagingBull.com services being provided to you. We have entered into contractual agreements with these providers governing the provider arrangement. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required to collect information about your sessions and your use of your RagingBull.com product and share this information, along with your personally identifiable information, with the provider paying for your Sherwood Ventures, LLC service. This information is kept strictly confidential, and is not shared with other third parties, except as provided for in this Privacy Policy.   
**12.1.6 Access to Information** : If you are a resident of Australia, on request, we will provide you with access to personal information that we hold about you collected when you visit our Website or use our Services (unless there is an exception that applies under Australian privacy laws, such as where we have a legal duty of confidentiality). Your request to obtain access will be dealt with in a reasonable time. We may recover from you the reasonable cost of providing you with access. 

**12.2 What We Do with Information We Collect and Use**   
In general, except as provided in this policy, we will not disclose your personally identifiable information to unaffiliated third parties without your express consent or allowing you to decline to permit the disclosure. There are, however, some limited circumstances, in addition to those set forth in section 3 above, in which we may need to disclose personally identifiable information about a user without express consent, including, but not limited to, the circumstances set forth below:   
**12.2.1. RagingBull.com Website Vendors** : We may employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf, such providing customer service, sending print and electronic mail, processing credit card payments, or other functions necessary to our business. In order to allow these companies to perform their obligations, we may need to share your personally identifiable information with them. However, we will provide these companies with only that information necessary to perform their functions on our behalf, and we will not allow them to use your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.   
**12.2.2. Resellers** : Sherwood Ventures, LLC may from time to time enter into agreements with companies that resell RagingBull.com' products or services, either on RagingBull.com' behalf, or on their own behalf on a private labeled basis and/or on a co-branded basis. Under the terms of these agreements, we may be required, and therefore we reserve the right, to share your personally identifiable information with such resellers. Once your personally identifiable information is provided to such resellers, it will no longer be covered by this privacy policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information will be governed by the privacy policy of the resellers to whom it is provided. Notwithstanding the foregoing, RagingBull.com will not share your Order Information with any reseller that is not billing you directly for the re-marketed, private labeled and/or co-branded RagingBull.com services to which you subscribe.   
**12.2.3. RagingBull.com Publishers and Merchants** : RagingBull.com reserves the right to provide to publishers and other merchants for whom RagingBull.com sells or distributes products or services any personally identifiable information as is necessary to fulfill any requests you may make for their products or services. In addition, merchants of the products you purchase or to which you subscribe through RagingBull.com may request additional personally identifiable information from you. RagingBull.com will provide the merchants of such products the information you supply in response to those requests and, following such disclosure by RagingBull.com, your personally identifiable information will no longer be covered by this policy. In those instances, your personally identifiable information is governed by the privacy policy of the merchants whose products you have purchased or to which you have subscribed.   
**12.2.4. Required by Law** : Sherwood Ventures, LLC will reveal your personally identifiable information, to the extent we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law. If we receive legal process calling for the disclosure of any of your personally identifiable information we will attempt to notify you via the email address you supplied during registration within a reasonable amount of time before we respond to the request, unless such notification is not permitted. 

**12.3 Changing or Removing Personal Information; Opting Out**   
To ensure that you have appropriate control over your personally identifiable information, you can access your account (after supplying your user name and password) in the Self-Maintenance area of our RagingBull.com Websites to update and/or correct the information you have previously submitted.   
In addition, we provide you with the ability to decline -- or "opt-out of" -- certain mailings and other materials we may offer. For these materials, you will be able to specify whether you wish to opt-out by following directions provided in the Self-Maintenance area, as further detailed in Section 11.4 (Communications to our Users) of our Privacy Policy, below.   
Finally, if you request, we will remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our active databases. Please understand, however, that it may be impossible to remove this information completely, due to backups and records of deletions. If you wish to remove your name and other personally identifiable information from our database, please create an email with the term "Unsubscribe" in the subject line, and send the email to the address listed in Section 11.9 of this Privacy Policy. As an alternative, you may write to us with your request, at the mailing address set forth in Section 11.9. You will be removed from our databases generally within ten business days of our receipt of your request. You may also request to review or amend any personal information that we maintain about you, by sending a written request to the same address, subject to our verification of your identity acceptance of any proposed revision. 

**12.4 Communications to Our Users**   
**12.4.1. RagingBull.com** : RagingBull.com sends emails and/or postal mailings to new subscribers and to provide to existing subscribers information regarding their specific RagingBull.com products. Periodically, RagingBull.com will send news and information to subscribers and other parties who have expressed interest in RagingBull.com and its products. You can opt out of receiving these promotional communications through the Self-Maintenance area of our RagingBull.com Websites. For so long as you use Sherwood Ventures, LLC products and services or otherwise maintain a business relationship with RagingBull.com, however, you may not opt out of receiving communications from RagingBull.com relating specifically to those products and services or business relationship.   
**12.4.2. Third Parties** : Except as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share personally identifiable information with anyone, unless we have informed you of a change to our Privacy Policy and given you the opportunity to then choose to opt out. Sherwood Ventures, LLC can no longer update any of your personally identifiable information once it has been transferred to such third parties and cannot implement or impose your opt out requests upon such third parties. Instead, you must either contact that third party or refer to its privacy policy to update your personally identifiable information or to let the third party know that you no longer want to receive promotional and/or marketing information about its products, services or offerings. 

**12.5 Security of Personally Identifiable Information**   
RagingBull.com maintains controls to protect the financial information you provide us, including credit card details, during the product purchase process. These controls include: (1) the use of SSL encryption to safeguard information when transmitted from your web browser to RagingBull.com; (2) the logical authentication security within the databases that store customers' credit card numbers; and (3) use of encryption of credit card numbers. 

**12.6 Relationship to Website Terms and Conditions**   
Our obligations with respect to your use of the RagingBull.com Websites are reflected in this Privacy Policy and the RagingBull.com Website Terms and Conditions and any additional terms of services that may be applicable.
