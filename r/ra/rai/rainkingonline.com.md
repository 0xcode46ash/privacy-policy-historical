**Last updated:** December 22, 2016

We have tried to keep this Privacy Policy short and simple. We encourage you to read it and contact us if you have questions about it. 

This Privacy Policy applies:

  * To RainKing’s services that link or refer to this Privacy Policy.

We collect and receive information about you in a few different ways:

  * _Information you give us._ You can give us information directly. For example: 
    * When requesting information about our Products or Online Services or registering to use our Online Services, RainKing requires you to provide us with personal contact information, such as name, company name, address, phone number, and email address (“Contact Information”).
    * In response to a survey, telephone call, email, or other communication from us as part of RainKing’s Research Activities to support our Products, you may give us business contact information, such as contact name, title, business address, phone number, email address, and other business-related information.
    * When licensing our Products and Online Services, RainKing may require you to provide financial and billing information, such as billing name and address, credit card number, and the number of employees within the organization that will be using the Products and Online Services (“Billing Information”). RainKing may also ask you to provide additional information, such as company annual revenues, number of employees, or industry (“Profile Information”).

Contact Information, Billing Information, Profile Information and Uploaded Information from Clients and Users are referred to collectively as “Client Information.”
    * _Client Information._ You may be a User that has been provided access to RainKing’s Products and Online Services through your company’s Subscription Agreement with RainKing. If so, your employer may have asked us to set up its Client account so that Users may designate certain information to be shared with other employees within the Client’s organization. This is done by designating the information as “Public” in the system. Please be aware: 
      * The option to make such information “Public” should not be used if the information is not to be shared with other Users within the Client’s organization.
      * A Client may also require that one or more of its Users be given global rights to access any and all information relating to each of its Users.
      * If you have questions or concerns regarding the rights of other individuals in your organization to access your information, you should raise those concerns with the appropriate person at your organization.
