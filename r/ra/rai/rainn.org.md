# Online Privacy Policy | Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network

Submitted by jasonh on Wed, 2006-02-08 18:47.

This Online Privacy Policy is intended to describe how the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network ("RAINN") handles information gathered at **www.rainn.org** ("RAINN.org") and from users of the National Sexual Assault Online Hotline (the "Online Hotline"). By visiting RAINN.org or using the Online Hotline, you agree to abide by the following terms and conditions of this Online Privacy Policy. RAINN may change these terms and conditions from time to time without prior notification, so please consult these terms and conditions regularly for any such changes.

Your privacy and security are very important to us. The following information will help you understand what information we collect online and how we handle that information once we collect it. This policy will tell you if we disclose that information to anyone, and what choices you have regarding how we use that information. Please note that this Online Privacy Policy applies only to RAINN.org and to the Online Hotline website and not to the websites of any other organizations to which we may link or that may link to us.

#### Collection of Information About You

Section A tells you how RAINN gathers information from users of the Online Hotline, and Section B tells you how RAINN gathers information from users of RAINN.org. If you are only using the RAINN.org website generally and are not using the Online Hotline, Section A (immediately below) does _NOT_ apply to you; you should read Section B.

If you decide to use the Online Hotline and then use the RAINN.org website separately or during the same time frame, your use of the Online Hotline cannot be connected to your use of RAINN.org.

#### A.Online Hotline.

We operate the Online Hotline in conjunction with participating rape crisis centers, which provide trained volunteers to help you during online sessions and supervisors to help monitor the quality of services. Any information that you share during an Online Hotline session will be viewed by the trained volunteer assisting you and will possibly be viewed by a supervisor monitoring calls for quality control.

If you provide feedback through an anonymous feedback survey following your session, that feedback may be shared with the trained volunteer assisting you and with personnel at RAINN and at participating rape crisis centers. However, the feedback will be anonymous and we will not ask for your name or any personal information or attach any feedback information that you provide during your Online Hotline session. 

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ "Personally Identifiable Information" is information about you that would identify you, such as your name or address. The Online Hotline is intended to be an anonymous service and you will NOT be asked to provide your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address or any other Personally Identifiable Information at any time during your use of the Online Hotline. In fact, RAINN specifically requests, for your own safety and anonymity, that you do not provide any such Personally Identifiable Information when you use the Online Hotline. In addition, the Online Hotline does not capture any Personally Identifiable Information about you or your computer before or during your use of the services. 

The information and text conveyed by you to our trained volunteers during your online chat session is intended to be part of a private conversation between you and the trained volunteer and will NOT be recorded, stored, saved or catalogued by RAINN. However, in order to determine usage levels and average session length, and for other recordkeeping purposes, an entry will be made in a database containing the start and stop time of each session. 

_Aggregate Data & Cookies:_ We automatically gather certain usage information, such as the number of users of the Online Hotline, length of stay and average length of sessions. This data cannot be used to identify you personally and helps us to determine how often the Online Hotline is being used, at what times of the day, and other useful statistics. We may use this aggregate data for internal recordkeeping and service improvement purposes and also may share it with sponsors, supporters or the media. 

The Online Hotline does NOT place any permanent or "persistent" cookies on your computer, although RAINN.org does use session cookies (see below). The cookies placed by RAINN.org cannot be used to identify you as a user of the Online Hotline. 

#### B. RAINN.org

_Personally Identifiable Information:_

__General.__ In general, visitors may browse RAINN.org without being requested to disclose any Personally Identifiable Information. However, there are pages on RAINN.org, such as donation pages, where we may request Personally Identifiable Information about you such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address or credit card number. RAINN.org may also collect information such as your computer's IP address. RAINN may seek such information in order to register you as a supporter of RAINN, to enable your making a donation or purchasing merchandise, or to use certain parts of the RAINN.org website. In addition, we may use such information to analyze site usage for RAINN.org, to improve our content and customize our site's content, layout and services. Finally, we may use your e-mail address to send you updates or newsletters apprising you of recent events and developments relating to RAINN and its mission or receipts for your charitable donations.

__Registration.__ In order to use many of the features of RAINN.org, you will be asked to register with RAINN. The information you submit as part of the registration process is used to update and maintain our files. We collect and save such information so that you are not required to submit it every time you make a donation. When you register with us, you will be asked to provide your e-mail address and select a password. You will also be asked to provide certain other personal information so that we may readily identify you. The RAINN website is designed to process and accurately maintain the information that you share with us. You are invited to access our website 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to change your profile information and are encouraged to provide us with feedback.

__Other Uses.__ We may use internal service providers to facilitate our services, and therefore, may provide some of your Personally Identifiable Information directly to them. In addition, we may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as website hosting, data analysis, and providing customer service. These companies and individuals will only have access to personal information needed to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose. 

__Opt-Out Procedures.__ When you register at RAINN.org, we may send you e-mails or newsletters to update you on events and developments pertinent to RAINN and our charitable goals. If you do not want to receive such e-mails, or if you want us to remove your profile or other information from our files for any reason, please email info@rainn.org and we will remove you from our system.

_Aggregate Data & Cookies:_ We automatically gather certain usage information, such as the number and frequency of visitors to RAINN.org, length of stay and other anonymous data. This data helps us determine usage levels on different parts of RAINN.org and to conduct other internal research. In addition, we may aggregate such data and disclose it in a non-personally identifiable manner to sponsors, supporters and other third parties to generate support for RAINN, its mission and its services or as required by law. In these situations, we do not disclose any information that could be used to identify you personally. 

For example, RAINN.org uses "session ID cookies." In general, a "cookie" is a small piece of text data stored on a user's computer by a website, in order to give that computer a unique identity to the website while performing certain processes, such as filling an online shopping cart and checking out, or calculating the number of unique visitors at a given time. Cookies may contain personal information, like email addresses, usernames, or passwords, or completely anonymous information, like a randomly generated number. They may be deleted once a user leaves the site, leaves a section of the site, or closes the browser; or they may remain, so that the website "remembers" the user when he or she next visits.

On RAINN.org, we use two session ID cookies. The first is used to measure the amount of overall traffic on our website; we use this data only in the aggregate, meaning no individual user can be identified from the data. This cookie is _in no way_ linked to Personally Identifiable Information, and is deleted from the user's computer when the user closes his or her browser. The second session ID cookie is only used when a user is making a donation or purchasing merchandise. This cookie carries a user's form entries from one page to another, and is deleted once the user leaves the "Donate"section of RAINN.org. We do not use permanent cookies, which retain information past a user's current visit.

#### How We Protect Your Security

RAINN stores any information on a secure server that is only accessible by RAINN employees. Again, we do not store transcripts of conversations using the Online Hotline. 

We care about the security of your personal information, and therefore have chosen to use VeriSign as a security solutions provider. 

We employ different security techniques to protect your personal information from unauthorized access by users inside and outside of our organization, including standard encryption practices. You should be aware, however, that "perfect security" does not exist anywhere on the Internet. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE WE TAKE APPROPRIATE MEASURES TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF INFORMATION, WE CANNOT ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION WILL NEVER BE DISCLOSED IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH THIS POLICY AND MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING THE SUFFICIENCY OF OUR SECURITY MEASURES. 

Always be careful and responsible regarding your personal information. We are not responsible for, and cannot control, the use by others of any information which you provide to them, including your e-mail address and password for RAINN.org. 

#### How We May Share Information

We will not publish, sell, share or rent information about you in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. However, we, including trained volunteers and rape crisis centers, may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances. We may be required to (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you that we possess to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe is necessary or appropriate in connection with the investigation of a crime, fraud, intellectual property infringement or other activity that is illegal or may expose us, or you, to liability. Also, if we, or a trained volunteer, fear that you are in danger of committing suicide or are under 13 years old, we, or the trained volunteer, may be required to disclose whatever information you have provided to the appropriate authorities. Trained volunteer are located across the United States. This means that the laws of the trained volunteer’s state may apply to your communications with that trained volunteer. Such laws may not protect your communications to the same degree, or in the same way, as the laws of your state. The data that we collect, and therefore may share, is limited in the manner described above. 

#### Our Policy Towards Children

We are concerned about the safety and privacy of children who use the Internet. Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request Personally Identifiable Information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information through RAINN.org without verifiable parental consent, we will use our best efforts to remove such information from our files. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with Personally Identifiable Information through RAINN.org without verifiable parental consent, he or she should contact RAINN at 202.544.1034 or [info@rainn.org](mailto:info@rainn.org). 

#### Other Information Collectors

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Online Privacy Policy, this document addresses the use and disclosure of information that we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to others, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of such information. We do not control the privacy policies of others. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.
