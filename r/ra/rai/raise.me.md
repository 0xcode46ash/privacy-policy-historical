# Privacy Policy - Raise.me

Raise Labs, Inc. (together with Raise.me, “Raise.me”) is committed to providing a safe, secure user experience. By choosing to create a Raise.me Profile you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy sets forth the online data collection and usage policies and practices that apply to the use of the Raise.me website (our “Services”). Your use of our Services is also governed by our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms_of_use).

Users participate in Raise.me voluntarily. Raise.me is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices of other websites to which you choose to link from Raise.me.

## What Information is Collected

Information collected may include, among other things, ‘Personal Information’ (which is information that can be used to identify or contact a specific individual, such as your name, phone number, address, and email address), account information (such as a password or other information that helps us confirm that it is you accessing your account) and demographic or other information (such as your school, gender, age or birthday, and other information about your interests and preferences). Any information combined with Personal Information will be treated as Personal Information.

You may have the opportunity to create a profile, which may include Personal Information, photographs, information about your academic and work history, your interests and activities, your use of the Services and other information (“Profile”).

The Services may provide you the opportunity to participate and post content publicly, through interactive features and through other communication functionality (“Community Forums”). You may choose through such features or otherwise, to submit or post reviews, problems, suggestions, ideas, solutions, questions, answers, comments, testimonials, resources, or other materials (“User Content”). Your User Content may also be posted in your profile. You may edit or remove your profile information, but you may not be able to remove answers or postings or other uploaded material. Note that anything you post to a community forum may be public. If you choose to voluntarily disclose Personal Information on a Community Forum, that information will be considered public information and the protections of this Privacy Policy will not apply.

In some instances, a User that wins a scholarship award may be required to provide additional information, such as proof of identity (which may include a driver’s license, passport, voting card or similar government issued identification), proof of academic and work history (which may include high school transcripts, standardized test scores, or references from teachers or counselors), or proof of financial need (which may include completing a FAFSA or CSS profile, and providing other family income documentation), in order to claim the award.

If a User does provide such information, he or she is thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Privacy Policy. The User maintains full rights and ownership of personal data. All information entered by a user is voluntary and at his or her discretion.

## How Information is collected

Raise.me may collect data when a user initially logs onto Raise.me and opens an account (“Registration”), creates a Profile, completes a scholarship challenge, or during the use of other Services on the site. 

Personal Information is mostly gathered directly from Users through online Registration forms. Only the User can modify his or her own, Raise.me Profile once it has been created. In some cases, with the User’s permission, the User’s school, school district, teachers, or parents may provide additional information about the User.

## Usage of Personal Information by Raise.me

Raise.me uses personal information to provide information and Services that a User has requested; to service a User's account; to improve Raise.me's Services; to develop and/or inform Users of additional products or services we think will be of interest and benefit to Users; to answer questions Users may have; and to inform winners of scholarships awards. A user may deactivate their account at any time and their information will be removed from Raise.me’s servers or made anonymous.

Each User is able to edit and update their information provided in his or her Raise.me Profile or account settings. Raise.me may, on occasion, email our users to send notifications about new features on the site. Each User shall be allowed opt-out or back into to such email messaging.

## Personal Information Usage by Third Parties

Raise.me will not knowingly sell, share, rent or otherwise transfer your information other than in accordance with the terms set forth in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise provided by law. 

We disclose information if legally required to do so, if requested to do so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process; (b) protect our rights or property of our affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of users or the public.

We do not disclose Users' Personal Information, combined personal and demographic information or information about use of Raise.me to Third Parties, except as set forth below:

## Sharing information on Social Media Platforms

The Services may permit interactions between the Services and a third party web site or service, such as enabling you to "like" a product within our Services or "share" content to other web sites, such as Facebook or Twitter. If you choose to "like" or "share" content or to otherwise post information from or via the Services to a third party website, feature or application, that information may be publicly displayed, and the third party website may have access to information about you and your use of our Services. Similarly, if you post information on a third party platform that references Raise.me or one of the Services, your post may be published on our Services in accordance with terms of that third party. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

You may also choose to participate in a third party application or feature through our Services (such as connecting to Facebook or otherwise linking the Services with another web site or interactive service) or on a third party web site or service (such as one of our Facebook applications or a similar application or feature on a third party web site or service) through which you allow us to collect (or the third party to share) information about you, including personal information. Information about you, including your name and preferences, may be shown to other users of the Services if you are logged in through the Services or through a third party web site or service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. When you choose to participate, you may be opting to link your activity on our Services with that third party web site or service, which may then collect information about your visits to our Services and may publish that activity as you request to your profile or similar feature with that third party (such as if you choose to share a scholarship award from Raise.me with your connections on the third party website).

The information we collect is subject to this Privacy Policy. The information collected and stored by the third party remains subject to the third party's privacy practices, including whether the third party continues to share information with us, the types of information shared, and your choices with regard to what is visible to others on that third party web site and service. The third party may allow you to remove the application or feature, in which case we will no longer collect information about you through the application or feature, but we may retain the information previously collected. In addition, we may receive information about you if other users of a third party web site or service give us access to their profiles and you are one of their "connections" or information about you is otherwise accessible through your "connections" web page, profile page, or similar page on a social networking or other third party web site or interactive service.

## Sharing Information with Colleges and Universities

Certain actions on the Raise.me site, including, but not limited to, winning Micro-Scholarships, submitting your Micro-Scholarship awards for redemption, applying to specific programs and scholarships, indicating you are planning to apply to a college, or adding a college to your list of followed colleges, may also result in your Personal Information being shared with a college or university.

Regardless of a User’s decisions regarding the sharing of his or her Personal Information, Raise.me reserves the right to share aggregate demographic data and related usage information with our business partners and university and college users. Such aggregate information will not contain any Personal Information that can identify any individual user. 

## Sharing Information with Parents, Counselors, Guardians and Advisors 

Raise.me may permit you to share access to your account with parents, guardians, school counselors or other trusted advisors. If you permit such access, they will have full or partial access to your account and personally identifiable information. 

## Sharing Information with other Third Party Service Providers

From time to time, Raise.me may decide that it is more efficient to use third parties to perform specific services, such as sending newsletters to Raise.me’s users, or software programmers and software vendors. If we use a third party to provide specific services (such as sending newsletters to our users on our behalf), then Personal Information (such as contact information) may be shared with that party to the extent necessary for such third party service provider to provide these services. These third party service providers are allowed to use Personal Information only for the purpose of providing the specific services requested by Raise.me. These third party service providers have agreed to hold and use your confidential information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. The third party services covered by this paragraph do not include links to third party sites found on our sites, which are governed by a more specific provision below.

## Sharing Information with other Non-Profit & Corporate Scholarship Administrators

If you are selected as a winner of a scholarship on Raise.me sponsored by a third party, such as a non-profit or Corporation, your profile information may be shared with a third-party scholarship administrator to select scholarship recipients. The third-party scholarship administrator may contact you directly to verify your profile information, including, but not necessarily limited to, obtaining copies of academic transcripts, proof of financial need if required, or any other documentation Raise.me or the scholarship administrator requires to award the scholarship and disburse funds to you, or your college or university.

## Accessibility & Correction of Information

If a User wishes to correct inaccuracies or make any other changes to the User’s profile, it can be accessed through our password protected access facility at [http://www.raise.me](https://www.raise.me/). If a User wishes to have his or her Raise.me Profile deactivated, he or she should contact Raise.me at [support@raise.me](mailto:support@raise.me) or do so under account settings. Deactivating your Raise.me profile does not guarantee that your information will be removed from third party records. Any information gathered is to the best of our knowledge collected lawfully and fairly through Raise.me and all information is assumed accurate and up to date and only information which is adequate and not excessive to our purpose for collection is retained. Users may review, correct, update or change their Raise.me Profile and the information therein at any time. 

## Other sites

Once you leave Raise.me’s website (even if it’s via a link found on our site), we no longer control the ways in which your Personal Information is collected. Our Privacy Policy only applies to Raise.me’s sites and Services and does not apply to non-Raise.me services that you choose to access through Raise.me. When we partner with other providers, we take their privacy practices into consideration, but we cannot and do not take responsibility for anyone else’s privacy policies. Make sure you read over the privacy policies of any other services you access.

## Minimum Age

Our site and services are in compliance with the requirements of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Therefore, we do not collect any information from anyone under 13 years of age, and our website, products, and Services are all directed to people who are at least 13 years old. Additionally, by using our site and Services, you are implicitly confirming that you are 13 years old or older.

## Cookies

We use cookie technology within Raise.me. We use cookies for remembering User names and passwords and for tracking click streams. Cookies cannot obtain personally identifiable information such as e-mail addresses, or any other information stored on our Users’ hard drives. Cookies are pieces of data normally stored by your browser, and you can quite easily prevent cookie data from being sent by adjusting your browser settings; however Raise.me may not function properly if Cookies are not enabled. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Raise.me pages, or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information. Because of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results and a more personalized site experience.

## Information Protection and Security

Raise.me implements a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of users’ personal information. These security measures include password protected directories and databases to safeguard your information and SSL (Secure Sockets Layered) technology to ensure that your information is fully encrypted and sent across the Internet securely. No data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we take sophisticated measures to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or guarantee the security of any information you send to us and you do so at your own risk.
