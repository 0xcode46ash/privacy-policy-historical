We will take reasonable care to keep your data secure and prevent unauthorised access to it by implementing accepted standards of technical measures and security policies. Whilst such reasonable efforts are taken, as the internet is an open system REL cannot however guarantee that unauthorised third parties will never gain access to REL's website by overcoming REL's precautions and security methods. REL cannot be held liable for what unauthorised recipients may do with information they gain access to. 

**7\. Cookies**

REL places a "cookie" on your computer to identify when you visit the REL website. These cookies are used to aid and identify customer behaviour, trends and demographics. Most, if not all, websites use cookies for this purpose. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies your computer to our servers. 

Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. If you disable the cookies you will still be able to use the website and book tickets.

We reserve the right (and you are deemed to agree) to match information gathered from cookies with any information you have given about yourself and to use information gathered from cookies to enhance your use of our website.

Cookies are used by our suppliers and affiliates in respect of which REL cannot advise and therefore cannot accept any responsibility. This website may contain links to other websites and such non-REL websites are not governed by this Privacy Statement as REL has no control over them. Accordingly, REL cannot be held responsible for the privacy and security policies and measures of other websites you may choose to visit and you do so at your own risk. Ensure that you read and understand the privacy and security policies of such websites so that you may understand how they collect, use and share your information.
