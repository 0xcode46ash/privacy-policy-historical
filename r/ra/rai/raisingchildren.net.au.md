unless certain exemptions apply.

The purposes for which the RCN uses the personal information referred to
above include the following:

information from the young person concerned.

other individual's

unlawful activity

individual.

not identifying themselves when entering into transactions with us.

party who is in a foreign country or another state or territory of Australia in
specified circumstances. This would include:

Privacy Officer

PO Box 175
POTTS POINT NSW 2011


The Privacy Officer will be made available to investigate and resolve the
complaint internally through mediation with the individual.
If the individual is not happy with the resolution of their complaint by the
Privacy Officer they may then complain to the Privacy Commissioner or
Industry Code adjudicator about the act or practice they consider to be an
interference with their privacy. The Commissioner then has the power to
investigate the alleged breach by examining witnesses, obtaining documents
and directing individuals to attend compulsory conferences. The Privacy
Commissioner's determination in such cases is enforceable by the High Court.
