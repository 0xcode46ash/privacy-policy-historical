We are committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the Rainier websites and governs data collection and usage. By using the Rainier websites, you consent to the data practices described in this statement. Our goal is to be a responsible steward of any information that we may obtain.

### Collection of your Personal Information

Rainier may collect personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone number. Rainier also collects anonymous demographic information, which may not be unique to you, such as your ZIP code, product interest, referral source, etc.  
There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Rainier. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring websites addresses. This information is only used by Rainier for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Rainier website.  
Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through any Rainier website public areas, this information may be collected and used by others.  
Rainier encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Rainier so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Rainier is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Rainier websites.

### Use of your Personal Information

Rainier collects and uses your personal information to operate the Rainier website and deliver the services you have requested. Rainier may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from Rainier and its affiliates. Rainier may contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.  
Rainier does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to any third party. In addition, Rainier may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to Rainier, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.  
Rainier does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations.  
Rainier websites will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Rainier or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Rainier; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Rainier, or the public.

### Use of Cookies

The Rainier website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  
One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Rainier pages, or register with Rainier site or services, a cookie helps Rainier to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Rainier website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Rainier features that you customized.  
You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Rainier services or Web sites you visit.

### Security of your Personal Information

Rainier secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Rainier secures the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

### Update your Personal Information

Rainier wants to ensure we keep only the most accurate and up-to-date information about you in our records. Therefore, whenever you believe that your contact information needs to be updated, please contact us at [customerservice@rainier.com](mailto:customerservice@rainier.com) to correct or update your contact information.

### Art Guidelines

_for large format digital printing_

We strive to produce the highest quality large-format printing in the industry. Large-format digital output has its unique requirements to achieve optimal results. Rainier Industries has many years of experience in digital imaging. We have provided these [**Art Guidelines (pdf)**](http://www.rainier.com/assets/Art-Guidelines.pdf) to help you get the highest quality results without incurring additional costs or unnecessary delays. Careful adherence to these guidelines will ensure complete success.

### Media

Please submit art on CD ROM or DVD discs. Files may be sent electronically via e-mail (if under 5MB) or via our FTP site. Please download our [**FTP Guide (pdf)**](http://www.rainier.com/assets/11-05-2012-Rainier-FTP-Login-guide.pdf) for additional information when utilizing our FTP server.

### File Preparation

Submitted files should be professionally created at full size in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator or Macromedia FreeHand and saved as native files (.psd, .ai, or .fh_ extensions, respectively). Some files created in other applications may be acceptable, but may be subject to additional preparation charges.

Artwork that exceeds the pasteboard dimensions in Illustrator or FreeHand may be scaled down, but please indicate the scale (50%, 25%, 10%, 1”= 1’, etc.).

Any document containing text should have all text elements converted to outlines, or paths; doing so will avoid font conflicts–a major source of delay for many jobs. Remember to save a copy for yourself without converted text just in case last-minute edits are necessary. Avoid complex blends and paths, and any transparency effects in Illustrator or FreeHand; these effects can cause major delays, or even prevent a file from processing at all.

Imported art elements should be linked, not embedded. Remember to update links and supply them along with the file to be output.

Furnish some form of color proof to match to, created from the submitted file and indicate any Pantone colors used. Supply all full-color files in CMYK color space.

Any artwork or imagery that extends to the edges of the finished piece will require bleed. Contact Rainier Industries to determine how much bleed will be necessary for your project.

Crop or trim marks should indicate the finished size of the piece.

### Image Resolution

Items produced in low quantities, smaller than 48” x 48” generally (though not always) are best printed on our HP5000 thermal ink jet printers. Minimum resolution for files intended for this printer should be 100pixels per inch. For very small items, 18” square or smaller, 200 ppi should be the minimum.

Our Vutek 3360 is generally the preferred printer for larger output sizes exceeding 48” x 48”, and these should be at least 50 ppi, not to exceed 100 ppi.

Very large final sized output (exceeding 16’) should be 25 ppi. Keep in mind Photoshop has a 30,000 pixel limit in any one direction (horizontal or vertical) when creating files for output.

[Contact us](http://www.rainier.com/contact) if you have image resolution requirement questions.
