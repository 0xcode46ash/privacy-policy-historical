# Privacy Policy

From time to time, we may share your Personal Information with our affiliates and/or partners who are offering programmes or benefits that we think will be of interest to you. By ticking the box you agree that we may share Personal Information with our affiliates and/or partners for this purpose. However, if you prefer not to have your personal information shared with our affiliates or partners in this way, you may opt-out of receiving e-mails or contact by telephone from our partners/affiliates by deselecting the check box on the checkout page. Our policy is both specific and strict. If you think our policy falls short of your expectations or that we are failing to abide by our policy, do please tell us.  Personal information includes your full name, address and contact details including email, but will never include your billing details.

We are constantly vigilant for credit card or other fraud.  We report all charge backs to a credit reference agency.  If you have any reason to seek the return of money paid, please contact us rather than your credit card issuer.

 Information may be unlawfully available to hackers and snoopers. We take no responsibility for this. The risk is no different from a similar risk in a bricks and mortar establishment. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a third party, any personally identifiable information collected at this site. If this policy should change in the future (most unlikely),   
then we shall provide notification in advance, and the opportunity for all users to indicate whether or not they would prefer that we do not provide the information to third parties as proposed.

 We do not market to children under 18 years of age. 

 Here is a list of the information we collect, and why it is necessary to collect it:

 **1**                    **    Basic identification and contact information, such as your name and contact details.**

 **1.7**                to help make our web site as useful to you as possible;  
 **1.8**                information which does not identify any individual may be used in a general way by us or third parties, to provide class information, for example relating to demographics or usage of a particular page or service. 

**2  **                    **Your domain name and email address**

The secure page where this information is given by you is controlled by our contract merchant service provider, Streamline.  Such information is automatically encrypted, and later decrypted for use. It never touches our system.  

**4**                      **Information volunteered by you**

for a particular purpose, for example a personal profile, survey, job application form, or contest.  This information will be used exclusively for the purpose for which you have provided it. Information is disclosed to third parties only where the third party concerned qualifies in whatever way the web site page requires.  We will make absolutely clear on the face of the page, any intention to publicise the name of a winner.

We expect you and any partner to reciprocate this policy.

 **7**                      **Disclosure to Government**

At any time you may review or update the personally identifiable information that we hold about you, by contacting us at the address below. To better safeguard your information, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to your information.
