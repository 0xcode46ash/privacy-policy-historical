# RateBeer.com -- Privacy Policy

|  There are currently five items that we offer our registered users. 

  1. Complete access to My RateBeer.com. This includes storing your own profile information to help you keep track of your own rated beers and personal messages. 
  2. Access to our forums. Registering gives you a voice on the user forums. Here you can discuss anything that is beer with the other registered users of the RateBeer.com. 
  3. Free stuff for reviewing and rating beers.
  4. Free monthly newsletter containing information about beer, ratings, events and happenings at RateBeer.com
  5. Pass information to brewers that you have reviewed so that they may offer you additional news, information, promotions, etc.



It is a priority at RateBeer.com to keep this information private.  When you sign up with RateBeer.com you will have the opportunity to let us know how you would like your information used.

The first four items keep your personalized information personal. Your private information is used **ONLY** for RateBeer.com transactions. In your new user sign up form, you may select an option (which is not selected by default) to allow us to provide your personal information to brewers around the world. If this is checked, your personal information will be given to only brewers we deem worthy of having it.

So with that settled, let's get back down to business.  Drinking beer!
