# Privacy Policy - RateSetter

### 1\. Introduction

We are committed to putting you in control of your privacy, whilst maintaining our primary responsibility to ensure the RateSetter platform is a secure way to borrow and invest money. These responsibilities extend to fraud, money laundering and other crime prevention; to careful credit assessment using manual and automated data collection; and to validating the identity of all users of RateSetter. 

This policy outlines what data we collect and how we use it. If you have any questions about this policy or about the use of your data, please feel free to contact us by telephoning on 020 3142 6226 or e-mailing us at [contactus@ratesetter.com](mailto:contactus@ratesetter.com "contactus@ratesetter.com"). 

### 2\. The type of information we collect and process

We may collect and process data about you and your interaction with us. This will include any information provided to us by you, obtained from any third party or generated through your use of our services and/or platform. The type of information collected may include: 

  * Personal information such as your name, address and date of birth.
  * Financial information such as your bank account number and sort code, details from your credit file and a record of payments made to or from RateSetter.
  * Sensitive information such as any medical information you disclose to us (although we will always get specific permission from you before recording this type of information).



You are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information to us and for informing us of any change to your information. 

### 3\. How we collect and process your information

Data can be collected and processed throughout your interaction with us, whether you are using our service through the RateSetter website or through a partner platform or website. For example: 

  * If you register as a lender or borrower, the details you enter will be stored and used to verify your identity;
  * When you request a quote or make an application for credit, your details will be used to conduct a credit check and both the details and result of the check will be stored;
  * When verifying your identity or assessing your application, we may ask you to provide us with additional information or documentation, copies of which will be retained;
  * If you go ahead to borrow or lend through the platform, we will make and retain records relating to the administration of your account, including copying and/or storing any letters, e-mails or other communications exchanged;
  * If we speak to you by telephone, all our calls are recorded for training and monitoring purposes and we may make and retain notes of any telephone conversation;
  * In the case of an agreement to borrow, we will keep details of your payment record and will share those details with credit reference agencies (see section 4 below for more details on credit reference agencies); and
  * When your use of the platform has concluded, we will retain information stored during the course of our relationship.



### 4\. Use of Credit Reference Agencies

If you make an application for credit or request a loan quote, we will search your records at credit reference and fraud prevention agencies ("CRAs"). We will use the information recorded to confirm your identity, assess your creditworthiness and to detect fraud, money laundering or other crime. Any agencies searched will keep a record of our search, which will be seen by other organisations making searches in future. 

If you proceed to take out a loan, details about you and your payment record will be reported to CRAs and may be used to help make credit and insurance related decisions about you and members of your household and occasionally for fraud prevention or to trace debtors. If you default or if there is any suspicious activity on your account, we may conduct further searches with CRAs during the currency of your agreement with us. 

If you register to lend through our platform, we will conduct searches with CRAs to verify your identity and bank account details. We may also undertake checks for the prevention and detection of crime, fraud and/or money laundering. 

If we decline your application for credit or to lend on the basis of information provided by a CRA, although we are not obliged to provide you with our reasons for the decision, you have the right to know the details of which CRA was used. You can then contact the CRA to request a copy of information held on your file. 

### 5\. Information we share

RateSetter do not sell or share your data with third parties unless we have your consent to do so or it is necessary for the operation and management of our business and your account. Examples of where it may be necessary include: 

  * Sharing your personal and financial details with agents, debt collectors or legal representatives who we instruct to assist us in recovering any debt owed to us;
  * On request, disclosing your information to the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Ombudsman Service, the police or any other regulator or government authority in order to fulfil our regulatory responsibilities, to help prevent or detect fraud or any other type of crime or for any other reasonable purpose identified by the relevant authority;
  * Where necessary for the administration of your account, for example in relation to the investigation of a complaint, we may discuss your account with any brokers, credit intermediaries or retailers involved or party to the transaction.
  * If you enter into a loan contract using RateSetter, either as lender or borrower, certain transactional and personal data relating to you and your account may be shared with other parties to the contract, their assignees or any agent instructed by them. This may happen where, for example, disclosure is necessary to enforce a loan contract, where someone has been instructed to act in RateSetter’s place or where the information is required for reporting purposes.



In cases where you are making an application for credit and we decline your application, we will give you the option to allow us to pass your details to one of our partners who may be able to help. If you consent and we do pass your details on to one of our partners, we will be acting as a credit broker in doing so and may receive a commission from the partner if your application with them is successful. 

### 6\. How we keep your data safe

All data sent from your browser to our websites is encrypted using industry standard SSL. You can tell that this is the case because the web site address begins with HTTPS. Our websites and databases are built using Microsoft .NET technology and are hosted in a secure data centre based in the UK. The data centre operates firewalls and other security mechanisms which are maintained and monitored 24/7 by the datacentre staff. 

We regularly verify the security of our systems by independent third-party testing. Access to your account is through a password protected mechanism, and you can choose to increase this level of security by using a PIN number sent to your mobile phone. Data is backed up regularly to a secure location and is fully encrypted. We may transfer your personal information abroad to countries whose data protection laws are less strict, and less protective of your rights than in the UK, but we will always do so securely. 

### 7\. Accessing your information

Under the Data Protection Act, you have the right to access any information RateSetter holds about you. You can do so by making a “Subject Access Request” to us by e-mail to [contactus@ratesetter.com](mailto:contactus@ratesetter.com "contactus@ratesetter.com") or by writing to us at the address detailed on our website. You may be asked to pay a fee of up to £10 to cover our costs and your request may take up to 28 days to fully process.
