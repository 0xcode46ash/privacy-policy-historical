# Privacy Policy - RateSetter

### 1\. Introduction.

We take your privacy very seriously. You should read this privacy policy carefully as it includes important information about how we will collect and use your personal data. We are committed to putting you in control of your privacy, whilst also making sure that the RateSetter platform is a secure way for people to borrow and invest money. 

This document contains important information about some of our key responsibilities. These include: protecting against fraud and money laundering and ensuring we comply with other crime prevention measures. We are also committed to careful credit assessment, using manual and automated data collection; and to checking the identity of all users of the RateSetter platform. 

This policy applies to information we collect about: 

  * Visitors to our website;
  * People who use the RateSetter platform;
  * Any other people who we do business with or who register with us.



If you have any questions about this policy or about the use of your data, please feel free to contact us by telephoning on 020 3142 6226 or e-mailing us at [contactus@ratesetter.com](mailto:contactus@ratesetter.com "contactus@ratesetter.com"). 

### 2\. The type of information we collect and use

In order for us to be able to offer a full range of services and products, we may collect and process data about you and how you communicate and interact with us. This will include any information: provided to us by you, from other sources (such as a third party credit reference agency) or generated through your use of our services and/or the RateSetter platform. The type of information collected may include: 

  * Personal information such as your name, address and date of birth.
  * Financial information such as your bank account number and sort code, details from your credit file and a record of payments made to or from RateSetter.
  * Sensitive information such as any medical information you disclose to us (although we will always get specific permission from you before recording this type of information).



You are responsible for providing accurate and up-to-date information to us and for informing us of any changes to your details. 

### 3\. How we will use your information

We gather information about you so that we can provide the services and products that you may request from us. Data can be collected throughout your interaction with us, whether you are using our service through the RateSetter website or through a partner platform or website. For example: 

  * If you register with us as a lender or borrower, we will store your details and use these to verify your identity;
  * When you request a quote or apply for credit, we will use your details for a credit check and we will store the details and the results of the check;
  * When we check your identity or assess your application, we may ask you to provide us with additional information or documentation, we will also store copies of this information.
  * If you decide to borrow or lend through the RateSetter platform, we will make and store records about your account administration, including copying and/or storing any letters, emails or other communications that we send to each other;



We may monitor and record communications with you (such as telephone calls and emails) for quality assurance, training, fraud prevention and compliance purposes. 

  * Where you borrow money through the RateSetter platform, we will keep details of your payment record and will share those details with credit reference agencies (see section 4 below); and
  * When you stop using the RateSetter platform, we will store information we collected about you for legal, compliance and operational purposes.



### 4\. Use of Credit Reference Agencies

If you make an application for credit or request a loan quote, we will search your records at credit reference and fraud prevention agencies (“CRAs”). We will use the information recorded to confirm your identity, check your creditworthiness and to detect fraud, money laundering or any other relevant crime. Any agencies that we search will keep a record of our search, which will be seen by other organisations making searches in future. 

In order to prevent or detect fraud, we will share the information: 

  * You provide in your application; or
  * Information we obtain through monitoring your account



with fraud prevention agencies. 

If you give us false or inaccurate information, and fraud is identified, we will pass these details to fraud prevention agencies to protect against fraud and money laundering. 

If you take out a loan with us, your details and your payment record will be reported to CRAs. This information may then be used to help make credit and insurance related decisions about you and members of your household. Occasionally the information may be used for fraud prevention or to trace debtors. If you default or if there is any suspicious activity on your account, we may carry out additional searches with CRAs. 

We may share information (both within the UK and, where appropriate, overseas) with credit reference, debt recovery, fraud prevention and law enforcement agencies, and other relevant organisations including other lenders for the purposes of recovering debt, preventing crime, verifying your identity and meeting our legal obligations. 

If you register to lend through the RateSetter platform, we will conduct searches with CRAs to verify your identity and bank account details. Your information may be used so that we can comply with applicable laws, including: anti-money laundering laws; anti-terrorism laws and regulations; and fighting crime and terrorism. 

This may mean that we have to share your information with UK or overseas governmental or regulatory authorities or with other similar bodies. 

If we decline your application for credit or decide not to lend to you because of information provided by a CRA, you have the right to know the details of which CRA was used. You can then contact the CRA to request a copy of information held on your file. Please be aware that we do not have to provide you with our reasons for a decision not to lend to you. 

We may and other organisations may access and use the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies both in the UK and overseas. 

If you require details of the credit reference agencies and fraud prevention agencies we use, please contact us on [contactus@ratesetter.com](mailto:contactus@ratesetter.com "contactus@ratesetter.com"). 

### 5\. Information we share

We do not sell or share your data with third parties unless we have your consent to do so or it is necessary for the operation and management of our business and your account. For example, we may need to share your information: 

  * With agents, debt collectors or legal representatives who we instruct to collect money that is owed to us;
  * With regulators or government authorities (such as the Financial Conduct Authority, Financial Ombudsman Service, the police, law enforcement agencies) where they ask us for information. We have to share information with these organisations to comply with our regulatory and legal responsibilities;
  * To administer your account. For example, to investigate a complaint, we may discuss your account with third parties involved or party to the transaction (this might include brokers, credit intermediaries or retailers);
  * For external processing: we have vendors and service providers who help with some of our processing and storage, including customer communication distribution;
  * If you enter into a loan contract using the RateSetter platform, either as lender or borrower, we may share some information with other parties to the contract. For example, we may share information to help us enforce a loan contract, where someone has been instructed to act in RateSetter’s place or where the information is required for reporting purposes.



If you apply for credit and we decline your application, we will give you the option to allow us to pass your details to one of our partners who may be able to help. If you consent and we do pass your details on to one of our partners, we will be acting as a credit broker in doing so and may receive a commission from the partner if your application with them is successful. 

### 6\. How we keep your data safe

All data sent from your browser to our websites is encrypted using industry standard SSL. You can tell that this is the case because the web site address begins with HTTPS.
