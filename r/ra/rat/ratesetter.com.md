### Why does RateSetter collect information about me?

A key responsibility for RateSetter is ensuring that we can positively identify every member, and our Registration screens capture data to validate your identity. If we cannot do so, then we reserve the right to request additional verification data before allowing a member to participate on RateSetter as either a Borrower or Lender. Additionally we may also collect 

data about you for the purposes of statistical analysis, monitoring, site optimisation, product and site marketing, email marketing and Customer Relationship Management. These are governed by industry best practice opt- out procedures. For more information see “Will RateSetter use my information for marketing purposes?”

### How will RateSetter use the information they collect about me?

#### For Borrowers:

We collect information about Borrowers to allow us to make an informed credit decision before approving them to take out a loan. This data allows RateSetter to identify you via credit and other reference agencies, to prevent fraud and to validate the affordability of any loan or product that you select through RateSetter. 

#### For Lenders:

We collect information about Lenders to allow us to positively identify you for the purposes of prevention of both fraud and money-laundering. 

### When will RateSetter contact me?

RateSetter reserves the right to contact all members for operational reasons concerning the management of their account by email, post or telephone. 

RateSetter contacts applicant Borrowers as a matter of course to validate information pertaining 

to the approval of a loan, including regular emails regarding the progress of a loan during the course of an application. We will also contact Borrowers during the course of the repayment of a loan at regular intervals, and in the event of any missed or late payments. 

RateSetter sends periodic updates about new products, services, content and information. Both Borrowers and Lenders can opt out of these communications at any time. 

### Will RateSetter share my personal information with a third party? 

#### RateSetter does not sell, share or otherwise pass personal information to a third party without your consent. 

The management of our business requires us to share and validate data with third parties such as credit reference, debt collection or law enforcement agencies. RateSetter reserves the right to change the nature and suppliers of that information and/or those services to ensure best practice. 

RateSetter keeps a log of any search, check or other validation of your data by a third party. Credit Reference Agencies reserve the right to record the check and validation of your account for their own operational purposes. 

#### Loanbroker Assistance 

We would however like to offer you the best service that we can. In the event that we are unable to offer you a loan with us, it may 

be possible to refer you to our decline partners, who may be able to assist you. Our partners are all free to use services which can search the loan market to find the best possible loan for your circumstances. If you do not want us to share your details with them, please **untick** the box on your SmartQuote application.
