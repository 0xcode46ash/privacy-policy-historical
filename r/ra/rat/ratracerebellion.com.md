**Privacy Policy  
**  
At Staffcentrix we recognize that privacy is important, and we are committed to safeguarding your information when you are visiting any of our sites (Staffcentrix.com, RatRaceRebellion.com, 2SecondCommute.com, MSVAS.com, WAHBoom.com). 

 

This Privacy Policy discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this site. 

 

**Personal Information**   
This site gathers personal information when you register for any service we are offering or when you voluntarily provide such information. Your personal information is never shared with third parties; however, it may be included among any statistics we generate regarding this site. That is, you will be “just a number” among many if we do share information with third parties, i.e., the Rat Race Rebellion has 10,000 members (and you may be one of them)! 

 

**Log Files / Statistics Trackers**  
Like the majority of websites, we do track and record information when you visit our website. Data collected and recorded includes the referring URL (where you clicked on a link to arrive here), IP address, browser type, country, platform type, type of domain (network, commercial, military, etc.), and date and time. This data does not link to personally identifiable information and is used, in the aggregate, to help us track the areas of greatest interest, responses to publications outreach, and other details that help us make this site as relevant as possible to our visitors. 

 

**Newsletters**  
When a person subscribes to one of our email newsletters (distributed via yourmailinglistprovider.com) we ask for an email address (required) and other optional information. Subscribers may opt-out of these communications at any time by using the “unsubscribe” feature that is included in every communication. 

 

**Cookies**  
This site does not use cookies (a piece of code that is placed on a user’s computer and tied to information about the user) except in instances when the user has entered a password to access information that is password-protected. 

 

As with many other websites, some of our advertisers may be using cookies; however, we cannot control these cookies once the advertiser has been given permission to place the ad.

**Links**  
This site contains links to other sites. Staffcentrix is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of those sites. We encourage you to be aware of when you leave our site and recommend that you refer to other sites' privacy policies for more information. 

 

**Advertisers**  
This site is supported, in whole or in part, by advertisements from outside companies. As noted above, these ads may contain cookies set by the advertiser, for their own purposes, and we do not have access to or control of the information they gather.
