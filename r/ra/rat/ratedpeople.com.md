## 1\. Information that we collect and store

We only collect, store or use information that we consider necessary for the purpose of providing the best service possible to all of our members. You are free to browse our website without providing any personal information to us. 

Customers who wish to find a Trade Business must register and provide us with their name, contact details and a secure password. We ask Trade Businesses for further information including their date of birth, gender, trade, specific skills, working preferences and payment details. We store this information on our secure server. We also ask for a drivers licence, passport or European identity card for identity verification purposes. We do not store this information. 

We also hold all information related to specific Project requirements, including the Project description, skills required, start date, any quotes provided and all updates, communications and ratings in connection with the Project. 

For quality control and training purposes, we may monitor or record your communication with our support team. 

In addition to the information referred to above, we also use third party tracking software provided by Inspectlet (www.inspectlet.com) to monitor your use of your Website in order to enable us to further improve your use and the functionality of our Website. This software enables us to monitor actions such as your key strokes, mouse movements, clicks etc. No sensitive information fields (such as credit card details) are recorded, however should you wish to opt out of the software being used, you are free to do so by visiting the [Inspectlet Opt Out page](http://www.inspectlet.com/optout) and following the instructions there. 

Our mobile apps use Flurry and Google Analytics to gather generic data about usage to help us improve the apps.

## 2\. How we use this information

We check the accuracy of the information that you provide on registration and during your continued use of the Service and remind you of your obligations to provide accurate information to us as set out in clause 4 of our respective [User Agreements](http://www.ratedpeople.com/c/legal-2). 

As part of the process of verifying information provided by Trade Businesses we may carry out, either directly or via carefully selected and appropriately regulated third party data verification agencies, identity verification checks on you to verify the information you have provided to us. This may include cross-referencing the information you have provided with – by way of example – electoral roll data, passport data, DVLA data, credit file data etc, If you do not consent to such checks being carried out please do not register with us. 

We may use the contact information you provide to contact you via email, fax, post or telephone regarding your registration, or any other matter that we consider relevant to your use of our Service. 

We make available anonymous details of a Project request to a limited number of suitable Trade Businesses. In the event that a Trade Business agrees to quote then contact information is forwarded to the Homeowner and Trade Business concerned. In addition any ratings and comments from Homeowners and Trade Businesses in relation to historic Projects are available for all users of the Website to see at any stage in the Project process.

We may use any information we collect about you, including any information we may have obtained from your use of the Service, to resolve disputes, provide customer support, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [User Agreements](http://www.ratedpeople.com/c/legal-2) and policies. We may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes. In the unlikely event that fees remain unpaid on the account of a Trade Business, we may pass your business information to a credit recovery company. 

We may disclose your personal data if we are compelled to do so by law, or in response to a valid, legally compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority. We may also disclose aggregated demographic and profile data (in which neither you nor any other individual is identified) to our commercial and marketing partners.

We further encrypt all passwords and other sensitive information such as payment details. Our server is protected by a dedicated firewall and we operate strict internal policies with regard to accessing personal information. However, we cannot guarantee the security of any information or data which is transmitted over public or third party networks. Please note: you must ensure that your password remains secret.
