## 1\. Information that we collect and store

We only collect, store or use information that we consider necessary for the purpose of providing the best service possible to all of our members. You are free to browse our website without providing any personal information to us.

Customers who wish to find a Trade Professional must register and provide us with their name, contact details and a secure password. We ask Trade Professionals for further information including their trade, specific skills, working preferences and payment details. We store this information on our secure server.

We also hold all information related to specific Job requirements, including the Job description, skills required, start date, any quotes provided and all updates, communications and ratings in connection with the Work.

For quality control and training purposes, we may monitor or record your communication with our support team.

## 2\. How we use this information

We check the accuracy of the information that you provide on registration and remind you of your obligations to provide accurate information to us as set out in clause 5 of our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/m/legal/user-agreement.html). We may use the contact information you provide to contact you via email, fax, post or telephone regarding your registration, or any other matter that we consider relevant to your use of our Service.

We forward anonymous details of a Job request to a limited number of suitable Trade Professionals. In the event that a Trade Professional agrees to quote then contact information is forwarded to the Customer and Trade Professional concerned. In addition any ratings and comments from Members in relation to historic jobs are available for all Members and non-Members to see at any stage in the Work process.

We may use any information we collect about you, including any information we may have obtained from your use of the Service, to resolve disputes, provide customer support, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/m/legal/user-agreement.html) and policies. We may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes. In the unlikely event that fees remain unpaid on a Member's account, we may pass your business information to a credit recovery company.

We may disclose your personal data if we are compelled to do so by law, or in response to a valid, legally compliant request by a law enforcement or governmental authority. We may also disclose aggregated demographic and profile data (in which neither you nor any other individual is identified) to our commercial and marketing partners.
