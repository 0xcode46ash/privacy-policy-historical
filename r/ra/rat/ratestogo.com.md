* To organizations that perform services for or on behalf of RatesToGo, for example to provide customer service, process credit cards, for research, marketing, data processing, to measure the use of our Web Site, to facilitate usage by a User, or to offer credit card services or evaluate your creditworthiness. We will share with these companies only that Personal Information which they need to work on our behalf. Some of these service providers may be located in countries outside Australia. Your Personal Information will be provided to these organizations only if they agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to RatesToGo, and under the instructions of RatesToGo, and with respect to that information, to act in a manner consistent with the relevant principles articulated in this Policy; 
* By submitting your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer, storing and processing of your Personal Information outside Australia to other companies in our group or to third parties who will provide you with a product or service to help us provide our services to you;
* We may collaborate with other companies to offer you additional Products or Services, for example, through promotions. We will share Personal Information that is necessary for these other companies to provide the Products or Services that you have requested.

Such circumstances may include:

* If required to comply with a subpoena or warrant issued or an order made by a court, person or body with jurisdiction to compel the production of information or to comply with the rules or court relating to the production of records. If we receive a formal request to disclose your Personal Information in connection with a legal action, we will attempt to contact you about it, if permitted by law, via the e-mail address you provided during registration, before we respond to that request. If you have not registered with us, we will attempt to contact you on the details you have provided in your transactions with us.
* If a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.
* To a person who needs the information because of an emergency that threatens the life, health or security of an identifiable person or group.
* Where it is necessary to collect monies owing to us.

## 6\. How we retain and store Personal Information

We will retain your Personal Information in our databases in accordance with our records management policy and applicable laws. This period may extend beyond the end of your relationship with us, but it will be only as long as it is necessary for us to fulfill the purposes for which your Personal Information was collected – this may include ensuring that we have sufficient information to respond to any issues that may arise later. For example, we may need or be required to retain information to allow you to obtain credit for a trip you Booked but had to cancel. We may also need to retain certain information to prevent fraudulent activity; to protect ourselves against liability, permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or where a law, regulation, rule or guideline requires it.

Your Personal Information will be stored in secured locations and on servers controlled by RatesToGo, located either at our offices or at the offices of our service providers as described in How we protect Personal Information.

## 7\. How we protect Personal Information

RatesToGo employs physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help protect the confidentiality and integrity of Personal Information and to reduce the risk of loss, misuse, unauthorized access disclosure or modification of Personal Information. When Personal Information is sent to our service providers, we require, in our contracts with them, that they protect all Personal Information in a manner consistent with the principles articulated in this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to contact RatesToGo through the Web Site, you should be aware that any information transmitted electronically via the World Wide Web might not be secure. RatesToGo assumes no liability for the loss of any information that you transmit to us via the World Wide Web. However, should you choose to pay by credit card when making a booking or reservation on the Web Site, your card details are encrypted for the transaction.

In communicating with you, we may send e-mail as unencrypted plain text because we are aware that most Members, Guests or Subscribers cannot readily process encrypted e-mail. This is done for your convenience, but with the security concern that, if misrouted or intercepted, it could be read more easily than encrypted e-mail.

While being transmitted over the Internet, your credit card details are protected using SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption. Credit card details are only used to pay for accommodation related costs booked through our service. These details are stored securely at all times, are not used for any other purpose and will never be provided to any unauthorised third parties.

## 8\. How to access or correct your Personal Information

We endeavor to ensure that Personal Information is as accurate, complete and current as necessary for the purposes for which we use that information. If you are a Member, we encourage you to visit your member profile tab to review your Personal Information. All Users of the Web Site may request access to, update of correct Personal Information we hold about them by emailing us at privacy@RatesToGo.com.

At any time, RatesToGo Members can view and/or update all the Personal Information in their member profile. To do so, login on the [Membership Homepage](https://www.ratestogo.com/account/myprofile) and click on "My Account" to view and/or make the required changes. Should you wish to cancel your membership with RatesToGo, simply notify us by sending an email to our Customer Service Centre.

If you request that we remove all of the Personal Information or travel records stored in “My Account”, we will promptly do so. Once required Personal Information is removed, however, you will not be able to use many of the services available on our Web Site to Members, unless you re-register.

Please remember that we may not be able to honor your request if we are legally obligated to retain that information, or for other reasons as described in ‘How we retain and store your Personal Information’.
