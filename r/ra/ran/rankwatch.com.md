# Rankwatch - Privacy Policy

We collect certain information relating to users who visit the site. Rank Watch does not make any attempt to obtain information that personally identifies our users who visit our site. It is not our policy to sell or otherwise provide access to such information to unaffiliated third parties. We collect the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumer access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services youâ€™ve requested, when we have your permission.

### Information Gathering and Usage

We may collect personal information from Users in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, when Users visit our site, fill out a form, and in connection with other activities, services, features or resources that we make available on our Site. Users may be asked to input their name, email address, phone number, address, payment information, and other information that we may deem desirable to collect for the purposes of delivering or enhancing our Site or services. Users may, however, visit our Site without providing this information. We will collect personal information from Users only if they voluntarily submit such information to us. Users can always refuse to supply personal information, except that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Site-related activities, and they will be unable to enroll in the service that we provide.

We may use the information we collect for internal reporting services, to create reports about rankings with all identifying information and keywords removed, and to help us help you. Namely, our service is designed to help you understand where you stand with your marketing efforts and to help us know how we can better serve you. Thus, we aggregate certain personal and non personal identifiable information, in an anonymous form, to help us develop new products, services, enhance existing ones, and create reports.

We may collect non-personal information about users whenever they interact with our Site. Non-personal information may include the browser name, the type of computer, IP address, operating system, Internet Service Provider, and other technical information about users' means of visiting our Site.

### Web Browser Cookies

Our Site may use "cookies" to enhance Users' experiences. Users' web browsers place cookies on their hard drives in order to allow us to distinguish user accounts for security and privacy reasons, and to conduct marketing campaigns, that we think may grab the attention of certain Users. For these reasons, enabling cookies is mandatory for full functionality of our Site and service.

### Data Ownership

Rank Watch uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Rank Watch. All search engine data and other important information collected through Rank Watch is owned by Rank Watch and licensed to its customers on an as-needed basis.

### How We Protect Your Information

We adopt appropriate data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure or destruction of your personal information, username, password, transaction information and data stored on our Site.

### Sharing Your Personal Information

We do not sell, trade, or rent Users' personal information to others. We may share generic aggregated demographic information not linked to any personal information regarding visitors and users with our business partners, trusted affiliates and advertisers for the purposes outlined above and for any other purpose we deem desirable for our business operations or our Users.

### Changes To This Privacy Policy

Rank Watch has the discretion to update their privacy policy at any time. When we do, we will revise the updated date at the bottom of this page. We encourage Users to frequently check this page for any changes to stay informed about how we are helping to protect the personal information we collect. You acknowledge and agree that it is your responsibility to review this privacy policy each time you visit our website or use our service, and remain aware of any amendments.

### Your Acceptance Of These Terms

By using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this policy and terms of service. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our Site. Your continued use of the Site following the posting of changes to this policy means that you accept those changes.
