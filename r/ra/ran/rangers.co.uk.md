We are not responsible for the disclosure of any information you post in this way.

  9.  **Disclosure of your information**

We may disclose anonymised details about use of our Site to other selected third parties e.g. to demonstrate patterns of use to advertisers and other business partners. The information we pass on will not include any personal information by which you may be identified.  For example, we do not disclose information about identifiable individuals to our advertisers, but we may provide them with aggregate information about our users (for example, we may inform them that 500 men aged under 30 have clicked on their advertisement on any given day). We may also use such aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target (for example, women in Glasgow). We may make use of the personal data we have collected from you to enable us to comply with our advertisers’ wishes by displaying their advertisement to that target audience.

We may also share your details with analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimisation of our Site.

We may also share your details with credit reference agencies for the purpose of assessing your credit score where this is a condition of us entering into a contract with you.

This may include exchanging information with other companies and organisations for the purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Our Site may include applications, content and/or adverts from third parties that may perform user activity tracking in addition to that described herein.

  10.  **Where we store your information**



The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”).
