Our sharing of your information

 ** _We do not share your personally identifiable information with any third parties outside of Rand McNally_** and its subsidiaries, except those who are providing products and services to you on our behalf. This includes (but is not limited to) providing a supplier with your information so that they can ship you products that you ordered, providing a shipping company with your information so they can deliver products to you, and providing a partner with your information so they can provide you with technical support or subscription services. 

We share overall customer, traffic, and trend information (but not personally identifiable data) with other respectable third parties. For example, we might say that half of the visitors to randmcnally.com also visit our online Travel Store. We also share aggregate information (general patterns and totals), but not individual data, with our partner companies in order to help them better understand and monitor the reach of our partnership promotion. 

Rand McNally is currently using Omniture, a third party, to track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers to administer our websites. All data collected by Omniture on our behalf is owned and used only by Rand McNally. We reserve the right to publish anonymous, aggregate summary information regarding our website visitors for promotional purposes and as a representative audience for advertisers. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of our memberships. 

When you register your software and/or hardware, your contact and product registration information may be shared with third-party companies who provide technical support on our behalf. This information is provided only for and restricted to support purposes. Additionally, if you register product with Rand McNally that is published and/or distributed by a third party we may share your contact and product registration information with that third party. In these cases we will provide this third party with your preference ("opt in" or "opt out") for receiving notifications for new products and promotions. 

If you come to a Rand McNally website through an affiliate website and make a purchase in our online Travel Store, some of your personally identifiable information may be shared with us as a means of tracking and verification. If you are logged in on the affiliate site prior to making a purchase on randmcnally.com, certain pieces of identifying information may be provided to the company that accounts and reports activity in our affiliate program. Some affiliates may provide us with additional personal information via a "source ID" if you are logged in as a member of their site when you enter randmcnally.com. Most such sites are ones that credit charitable organizations, as opposed to commercial websites, and this information is most often used to credit your account with making a purchase on our site. 

It is possible that Rand McNally, its subsidiaries, or any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another business entity. Should this occur, you should expect that some or all of your information would be shared so that we can continue to provide our services. We will endeavor to provide notice of such event (to the extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined entity follow the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy. 

Changing your personally identifying information and opting out

If you registered on randmcnally.com or subscribed to our subscription services, you let us know your preference for receiving promotional emails from us when you completed your member profile. We ask if you are interested in receiving special offers and announcements from us, and may use the information you provide as part of our efforts to keep our customers informed of our products, services, and promotions. To stop receiving promotional emails from us, we ask that you update your preferences. To do so, you'll first need to sign in (if you haven't already done so). Then go to the My Profile page of the My Info section and update your answer to the following question:   
_Would you like us to inform you of special Rand McNally offers, promotions, and events for members?_

If you are not a registered member on randmcnally.com and would like to be removed from our mailing list, please click the "Unsubscribe" link in the email communication you have received, and enter you email address to be opted-out immediately. 

Security on Rand McNally websites

We use an industry standard encryption process called SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) to encrypt highly sensitive communication between your browser and our server. This protects the transfer of information between you and us. The SSL process is widely used on many shopping websites. We use the SSL process in three areas on our site: at the checkout in our store, when you log in as a member, and when you join Rand McNally Road Explorers or make changes to your membership information in the My Info section. 

In fact, [VeriSign](http://www.verisign.com/), a Certification Authority (CA), has issued us a certificate, which confirms that it is safe for you to give us your credit card information, as we have the best possible encryption technology currently available for secure online commerce. 

The safekeeping of the information that you entrust to us is very important, so we take several steps to protect it. 

First of all, to protect your personal information we have some of the best firewall and software intrusion detection systems available today. A firewall prevents unauthorized access to our network and our databases. An intrusion detection system keeps a close watch on the servers and lets us know right away if someone is attempting to break into our systems. Additionally, highly sensitive information, such as your credit card number, is first changed into scrambled code, through a process called encryption. 

If you are making a purchase in our online store, your information, including your encrypted credit card number, is stored in our database. If you are signing up as a Premier member of Road Explorers, your credit card is encrypted and transmitted to our business partner who manages the billing for Road Explorers. The entire transmission is securely encrypted. Our business partner also uses the latest encryption technology and security measures to protect your personal and credit card information. 

Your password is encrypted in a one-way encryption process, which means that while our system can recognize you when you put in your member or user name and password, we don't have access to your password. If you lose it, we will help you create a new password to access your membership information. 

Protection for Children

Children should always ask a parent or guardian for permission before providing any personal information to Rand McNally or purchasing any products or services from Rand McNally. We expressly adhere to all laws and policies related to children's privacy. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifying information from or about children under 13, except as permitted by law. If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe Rand McNally has any information from or about anyone under 13, please contact us in the manner provided for below. 

Additional information and how to contact us

We reserve the right to change our privacy policy as we adopt new technology and as the needs of our customers and company evolve. Our current policy will always be posted. 

For your convenience, our websites contain links to a wide variety of other websites. We do not control how these other sites gather and use information about their users. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of all sites you link to from our site.
