# Privacy Policy - Rant Lifestyle - Rant Lifestyle

Rant Media Network, LLC knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. By visiting our website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy covers Rant Lifestyle’s treatment of personal information that Rant Lifestyle gathers when you are on the Rant Lifestyle website and when you use Rant Lifestyle services. This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Rant Lifestyle does not own or control, or to individuals that Rant Lifestyle does not employ or manage.

Information Collected by Rant Lifestyle

We only collect personal information that is relevant to the purpose of our website. This information allows us to provide you with a customized and efficient experience. We do not process this information in a way that is incompatible with this objective. We collect the following types of information from our Rant Lifestyle users:

1\. Information You Provide to Us: We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

2\. Automatic Information:

We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us. Rant Lifestyle and its authorized agents automatically receive and record certain “traffic data” on their server logs from your browser including your IP address, Rant Lifestyle cookie information, and the page you requested. Rant Lifestyle uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its servers, analyze trends and administer the website.

Rant Lifestyle may collect and, on any page, display the total counts that page has been viewed.

Many companies offer programs that help you to visit websites anonymously. While Rant Lifestyle will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.

E-mail Communications

Rant Lifestyle is very concerned about your privacy and we will never provide your email address to a third party without your explicit permission, as detailed in the “Sharing Your Information” section below. Rant Lifestyle may send out e-mails with Rant Lifestyle-related news, products, offers, surveys or promotions.

Cookies

Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our website are visited and by how many people. Rant Lifestyle cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your screen name or e-mail address is.

The “help” portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. We recommend that you leave the cookies activated because cookies allow you to use some of Rant Lifestyle’s coolest features.

Rant Lifestyle’s advertising partners may place a cookie on your browser that makes it possible to collect anonymous non-personally identifiable information that ad delivery systems use to present more relevant ads. If you would prefer to opt-out of this standard practice, please visit our advertising partner Platform-A’s privacy policy and opt-out page.

Although it is our hope that you find the display of advertising to you based on your anonymous interests valuable, if you would prefer not to participate in the services offered through these solutions, you can always opt-out of this activity by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) website by clicking <a href=”http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp”>[here]</a>.

Rant Lifestyle Personnel: Rant Lifestyle personnel and authorized consultants and/or contractors may have access to user information if necessary in the normal course of Rant Lifestyle business.

Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Moreover, if Rant Lifestyle, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred.

Protection of Rant Lifestyle and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with a law; to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other policies; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Rant Lifestyle, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Syndication: Rant Lifestyle allows for the RSS syndication of all of its public content within the Rant Lifestyle website.
