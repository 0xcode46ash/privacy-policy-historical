# Randstad Technologies - privacy statement

**Your privacy is important to us**  
Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information has always been a fundamental principle in our business relationships. We want you to know that Randstad Canada adheres to privacy legislation that governs what information may be collected, how it is used and how it is protected. This Privacy Statement explains our privacy policies and information handling practices. 

**Protecting your privacy means:**

• We keep your personal information and the business you do with us in strict confidence 

• We do not sell your personal information 

• You have control over how we obtain, use, and give out personal information about you 

• You have reasonable access to the personal information we have about you 

• We respect your privacy when we market our services 

**Why we collect personal information**  
We collect information in order to represent you for employment opportunities with our clients, to carry out contests or surveys, to administer our web site, and to provide information about our services. We understand that some of this information is personal. We collect, use and disclose personal information only for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstances. The information we will collect from you includes, but is not limited to: 

• Your personal profile via your resume and information supplied by you 

• Your employment preferences, such as work location, salary, and other personal factors important to you 

You can visit our web site without sharing any personal information. While visiting our site, you may choose to provide information in the form of a resume or by creating a profile using our online My Randstad tool. In order to be considered for opportunities with our clients, you may choose to provide references. While using our web site, you may choose to provide personal information in order to enter a contest or complete a survey. 

**What we do with personal information**  
When you provide personal information to us in the form of a resume, references, complete a profile using our My Randstad tool, or by participating in a contest or survey, the information will be stored in our secure database. We may use your personal information to: 

• Match your profile against our clients’ requirements 

• Contact you regarding profile matches 

• Contact and obtain information about you from references supplied by you (upon your approval, see Your Information is Obtained or Used Only With Your Consent) 

• Provide your information to clients (upon your approval, see Your Information is Obtained or Used Only With Your Consent) 

• Carry out contests and/or surveys 

• Improve our site and, where applicable, the services we offer 

• We may send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners from time to time. If you have concerns about receiving occasional communication from us, please contact our [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacyofficer@randstadgroup.ca). 

• Demographic data collected while visiting our site is used to tailor your experience at our site and to display content that we think you might be interested in. We also use this data to learn more about the demographics of our site visitors and to refine our marketing plans. 

• For other similar or related purposes that are reasonably necessary for the proper management of Randstad Canada’s business. 

**Randstad Canada consultants/placements**  
When you are placed with one of our clients, we will collect additional information in order to complete the placement process. In addition, we will survey you to ensure that we are offering our consultants the best possible opportunities and to provide our clients with constructive feedback. We will survey clients to verify and confirm the information we currently have in your file and to ensure our consultants are consistently meeting client expectations.   
Please note that all active contract consultants will receive communication from Randstad Canada containing pertinent information related to current placements. 

**Your information is obtained and used only with your consent**  
We want to assure you that any personal information you provide to Randstad Canada will remain completely confidential until you request otherwise, unless required by law. We do not sell or provide candidate or client information to third parties. We will always obtain your authorization to contact references and we will always contact you via email or telephone before we submit your profile to a client requirement. 

**Your consent can be express or implied**  
Express consent can be verbal or written. You imply consent when we reasonably conclude that you have given consent by some action you have taken, or when you decide not to take action. For example, by providing your contact information, profile or other personal information to a recruitment specialist or through our web site, you are granting your consent to allow Randstad Canada to use your profile information in the matching process, and to contact you regarding any such matches. 

**You can withdraw your consent after you’ve given it**  
While we would like your consent to continue to collect and use your information as outlined above, we want you to know that you do have choices. In addition, you can request to have your information removed from our database, or opt out of receiving optional future mailings at any time by contacting our [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacyofficer@randstadgroup.ca). 

**We protect your information from error, loss, and unauthorized access**  
Our employees who have access to your information are made aware of how to keep it confidential. Each employee is governed by policies regarding information handling. Only employees who require access to your information in the course of their duties will have access to your information.   
We respect the confidential information that we receive from others and therefore will not release any personal information provided to us by third parties without their explicit authorization.  
As a member of the Randstad Canada online community, you have access to your own information, information about positions that match your profile, plus additional information and tools. Select Randstad Canada personnel have password-protected access to your information. Authorized client/employer contacts are able to view candidate information without seeing your identity. No client/employer contact may view your personal information (identity or contact information) without your prior permission. 

**You can see and verify the accuracy of your information**  
You can update your personal information at any time through our web site or by contacting [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacyofficer@randstadgroup.ca).   
If you would like access to the personal information we have on file for you, we will ask you to put your request in writing. You will be given reasonable access to your personal information to verify or correct information. Every effort will be made to respond to your inquiry within 30 days. There may be circumstances where Randstad Canada will not provide you with access or may require additional time to meet your request, in which case you will be informed.
