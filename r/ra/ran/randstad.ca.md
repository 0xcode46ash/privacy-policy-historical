# Randstad Privacy Policy | Randstad Canada

### Policy Owner:  Lara Speirs, General Counsel, has been appointed as Chief Privacy Officer.

#### Purpose:

Randstad Interim Inc. (“Randstad Canada”) is committed to take all reasonable steps to preserve the confidentiality of all Personal Information it collects in order to manage its business and maintain the employment relationship in a manner consistent with applicable law.

The purpose of this Privacy Policy (“this Policy”) is to provide Randstad Canada with a framework to ensure that we handle Personal Information with a view to managing our privacy-related risks and complying with applicable law. It governs the collection, use, disclosure, retention and destruction of Personal Information in the course of our commercial activity. 

The Policy sets a minimum standard for handling Personal Information and sets out guidance for the handling of Personal Information.  This policy is consistent with and supportive of Randstad’s Business Principles, namely principles 1, 4, 9 and 15:

1\.         We know and comply with the laws that govern our business, international human rights principles and Randstad’s internal policies and procedures;

4\.         We ensure that our records (including those containing Personal Information) are created, used, stored and destroyed in accordance with law;

9\.         We respect the right to privacy, ensure that confidential information is kept confidential and we do not abuse the confidential information of others; and

15\.        We maintain and provide full, fair, timely, accurate and understandable contracts, records and financial information.

#### Scope/Applicability

This Policy applies to all Randstad Canada’s internal employees, temporary workers, assigned resources, applicants, candidates, Coop students, interns, volunteers and independent contractors (“Individuals”).

This Policy is a local Canadian adaptation of Randstad Holding’s Data Protection Group Policy, as found at: https://www.Randstadatwork.com/corporate-information/values-policies/corporate-policies.  This policy has been adapted to comply with local Canadian laws and regulations.  In the event of a conflict between these two policies, it is this local Canadian Policy that shall prevail.
