# randstad canada - privacy

Preserving the confidentiality of personal information – including that of our candidates, contractors, clients, and our employees – has always been a foundation of our business practices at Randstad Interim Inc. (“Randstad Canada”). 

The purpose of this personal information protection policy is to provide Randstad Canada with a framework to ensure that we handle personal information with a view to managing our privacy-related risks and complying with applicable law. It governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal information in the course of our commercial activity and in the course of employing corporate employees. 

The policy sets a minimum standard for handling personal information and sets out guidance for the handling of personal information. This policy is consistent with and supportive of Randstad’s Business Principles.

## Personal Information

"Personal information" includes factual or subjective information about an identifiable individual. 

## Privacy protection principles

Employees and others who collect, use and disclose personal information on Randstad Canada’s behalf must comply with the following principles. Personal information must at all times be:

  1. Processed fairly, lawfully and as authorized 
  2. Processed for reasonable and specified purposes 
  3. Processed only as reasonably necessary 
  4. Subject to reasonable measures to ensure accuracy 
  5. Subject to reasonable measures to ensure security 
  6. Subject to retention rules that limit unnecessary retention 
  7. Subject to a process that allows for access and correction 



Each of these principles is described in more detail in the following sections.

## Accountability 

Randstad Canada accepts responsibility for treating all personal information in an appropriate and lawful manner. Our Privacy Officer is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy and applicable privacy legislation and answering related questions.

## Fair, lawful and authorized processing

This policy allows Randstad Canada to collect, use and disclose personal information for its legitimate purposes provided it does so in a fair and lawful manner. 

Randstad Canada should ordinarily identify itself as accountable for the personal information it collects and should ordinarily identify anyone to whom it will routinely disclose or transfer personal information, including other companies within the Randstad Group. 

Randstad Canada collects, uses and discloses personal information based on informed consent unless permitted or required by law.

Randstad Canada only relies on implied consent when appropriate in light of the sensitivity of personal information and individuals’ reasonable expectations. The Company relies on implied consent to collect, use and disclose the personal information of corporate employees for the purpose of establishing, managing or terminating its employment relationships.

## Processing for reasonable and specified purposes

Randstad Canada collects, uses and discloses personal information for reasonable business purposes that it identifies to individuals at the time of collection except as permitted or required by law.

Randstad Canada refrains from collecting personal information for one purpose and then using it for another without consent except as permitted or required by law.

## Processing only as reasonably necessary

Randstad Canada only collects, uses and discloses personal information to the extent that it is reasonably required for a reasonable and stated business purpose.

Randstad Canada specifies the type of personal information it collects as part of its recordkeeping and information-handling policies and practices.

In the course of its commercial activity, the Company ordinarily collects, uses and discloses personal information for the following reasonable business purposes: to provide services, including staffing services, search & selection and MSP services.

As an employer of corporate employees, Randstad Canada collects, uses and discloses personal information for the purpose of establishing, managing or terminating its employment relationships and managing and auditing its operations. These purposes include preventing and responding to work-related misconduct, breaches of law and other activities that may harm Randstad Canada’s interests.

## Accuracy

Randstad Canada employs reasonable measures to ensure that personal information is kept as accurate as required for its purposes. 

Requests for correction of personal information are handled in accordance with rights granted under applicable legislation and good recordkeeping practices.

## Data security

Randstad Canada takes reasonable security measures to protect personal information against unlawful or unauthorized access, loss and damage.

Randstad Canada maintains policies, procedures and technologies (in accordance with the Group IT-security policy) to maintain the security of personal information from the point of collection to the point of destruction.

## Limited retention

Record retention schedules are created and enforced for records containing personal information.

Randstad Canada establishes record retention rules so that it does not retain personal information longer than necessary for the purposes it was collected unless required by law.

## Access and correction

Randstad Canada provides individuals with access to personal information and a means of correcting personal information in accordance with applicable privacy legislation.

## Providing information over the telephone or by email

Any corporate employee dealing with telephone or email enquiries should be careful about disclosing any personal information held by Randstad Canada. In particular, they should:

  1. Check the requesting person's identity to make sure that information is only given to a person who is entitled to it. In case of uncertainty about the requesting person’s identity and therefore legitimacy of the request, no information should be provided. 
  2. Suggest that the caller puts the request in writing or that the requesting person comes by in person if they are not sure about the caller's identity and/or where their identity cannot be checked. 
  3. Refer to the Privacy Officer for assistance in difficult situations. No one should allow themselves to be pressured into disclosing personal information. 



Where third parties, in person, are requesting personal information, e.g. authorities demanding information in a Randstad office, the same principles as in (a) and (c) apply.

## Transferring and disclosing personal information

Randstad Canada only transfers personal information to another entity (whether within the Randstad Group or outside it) if the transfer complies with the principles and the other rules set out in this policy and with applicable privacy legislation.

Randstad Canada (i) employs due diligence in selecting organizations to process personal information on its behalf, (ii) imposes reasonable contractual terms on such organizations with a view to maintaining comparable data security and (iii) oversees such organizations with a view to maintaining comparable data security.

Transfers of Personal information from Canada to processors in countries outside Canada may be made subject to the terms of this policy and subject to any notification requirements under applicable legislation. 

## Promoting compliance
