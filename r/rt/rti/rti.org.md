# Privacy Policy - RTI International

This privacy policy applies to transactions and activities in which you engage ("Transactions") and to data you gather on this site (the "Site"). It does not apply to any other website or offline point of contact between you and RTI. By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in the privacy policy in effect at the time of your visit.

##  Guiding Principles

The commitment of RTI International to the protection of your information is summarized by the following principles:

  * We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our Site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.
  * We will not share any personally identifying information about you with any third party without your permission, unless required by law (see [Terms of Use](http://www.rti.org/page.cfm?objectid=0D074E8A-F14A-54CC-188BC53FB9F32A3F)).



  
The following sections provide more detail on how RTI will handle information obtained about your visit to this Site. The information we receive depends on what you do when visiting our Site.

##  If You Visit This Site to Read or Download Information

We collect and store only the following information about you:

  * Name of the domain you used to access the Internet (e.g., asdf.com, ncsu.edu, nih.gov)
  * Date and time you accessed our Site
  * Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Site
  * Type of web browser you used
  * Information you viewed while visiting our Site



  
We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our Site, find out what information is most viewed, and to help us make our Site more useful to visitors.

The information gathered is used for two purposes: management of the Site and, in the case of suspected unauthorized activity, for law enforcement and possible criminal prosecution (see [Terms of Use](http://www.rti.org/page.cfm?objectid=0D074E8A-F14A-54CC-188BC53FB9F32A3F)).

##  If You Decide to Provide Iidentifying Information About Yourself

We may require you to provide us some personally identifying information if you choose to engage in such activities as

  * Requesting information from us
  * Commenting on a post



  
In each case, the type of information needed to fulfill your request will be specified in a form on our Site, and typically includes only name and email. This personal information will be stored in our database and will only be used to provide the service you have requested. As stated earlier, we will not share this information with any third party, except if required by law.

##  Cookies and Other Information Stored on Your Computer

Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and passwords, which some web servers collect when you access them. The data are stored on your hard drive, not on the website's server. Whenever you visit a "cookie" site, the server looks for its cookie on your hard drive and, if found, reads the information stored. Cookies are typically stored in your browser's directory or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh).

This Site sets persistent "cookies" only to tailor the Site to user-selected preferences such as displaying the Site in a version designed for the visually impaired. We do not use persistent cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. This Site uses session cookies to help reduce the amount of information you will have to re-enter when entering data into forms. We also use session cookies to manage and balance web traffic among RTI web servers and to maintain session state information as you navigate through this Site. Session cookies are stored only in the volatile memory of your computer, and expire automatically when you close your browser or otherwise end your browser process.

##  Security

We use what we believe to be commercially reasonable security procedures to protect personally identifiable information that you provide to us. While we consider these procedures to be adequate, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of storage, is completely secure. Therefore, there is still a risk that your personally identifiable information could be misappropriated and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
