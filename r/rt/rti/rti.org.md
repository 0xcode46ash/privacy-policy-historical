# Privacy Policy - RTI International

The commitment of RTI International (RTI) to the protection of your information is summarized by the following principles.

###  Guiding Principles

We will not obtain personally identifying information about you when you visit our Site, unless you choose to provide such information to us.

We will not share any personally identifying information about you with any third party without your permission, unless required by law (see [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.cfm) page).

###  Google Analytics

We are using Google Analytics ("GA") as our website usage and analysis tool and do convey to their web service the information indicated below. We do not provide any personally identifying information to GA. If you do not wish for your usage statistics to be sent to GA, please use the following form to set a cookie on your browser to let our website know that you wish your usage to be kept private. Our web server will continue to log all traffic to this site but your usage will not be included in our GA analysis reports. You will need to reset this form if you restart or clear your cookies from your browser.

###  Application of this Privacy Policy

This privacy policy only applies to transactions and activities in which you engage ("Transactions") and to data you gather on the RTI external Web site (the "Site") and does not apply to any other Web site or offline point of contact between you and RTI. Please review this privacy policy periodically as we may modify it from time to time.  By visiting our Site, you are accepting the practices described in the privacy policy in effect at that time. This privacy policy was last revised on 7/23/2008.

The following sections provide more detail on how RTI will handle information we learn about you from your visit to this Site. The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting our site.

###  If you visit this Site to read or download information

We collect and store only the following information about you:

  * the name of the domain you are using to access the Internet (for example, asdf.com, if you are connecting from an ASDF online account, or ncsu.edu if you are connecting from N.C. State University's domain)
  * the date and time you access our Site
  * the Internet address of the Web site from which you linked directly to our Site
  * the type of Web browser you are using
  * what information you view while visiting our Site



We use the information we collect to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our Site, find out what information is most viewed, and to help us make our Site more useful to visitors.

The information gathered is used for two purposes: management of the Site and, in the case of suspected unauthorized activity, for law enforcement and possible criminal prosecution (see [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms.cfm) page).

###  If you decide to provide identifying information about yourself

You may decide to provide us personally identifying information for reasons such as

  * Registering for an event or to receive a newsletter
  * To have information sent to you
  * To access restricted information on our Site



In each case, we will let you know what type of information we need. This personal information will be stored in our database and will only be used to provide the service you have requested. As stated earlier, we will not share this information with any third party, except if required by law.

###  Cookies and other information stored on your computer

Cookies are essentially tokens of information, such as preferences and passwords, which some Web servers collect from you when you access them. That data is stored on your hard drive, not on the Web site's server. Whenever you visit a "cookie" site, the server looks for its cookie on your hard drive and, if found, then reads the information it stored there. Cookies generally are stored in your browser's directory or folder in a file named cookie.txt (MagicCookie on a Macintosh).

This Site sets persistent "cookies" only to tailor the Site to user-selected preferences such as displaying the Site in a version designed for the visually impaired. We do not use persistent cookies to collect or store personally identifiable information. This Site uses session cookies to help reduce the amount of information you will have to re-enter when entering data into forms. We also use session cookies to manage and balance Web traffic among RTI Web servers and to maintain session state information as you navigate through this Site. The session cookies are stored only in the volatile memory of your computer, and expire automatically when you close your Web browser or otherwise end your browser process.
