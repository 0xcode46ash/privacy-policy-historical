# Privacy Policy | Revlon.com

## I. General

Revlon, Inc. and its affiliated companies ("Revlon") respects the privacy of every individual who visits this Web site, www.revlon.co.za (the "Site"), and all other Web sites owned, operated or maintained directly or indirectly by Revlon, including, without limitation, almay.com, and revloninc.com (the "Revlon Sites"). The data controller for the Site is Revlon, Inc. (website: www.revlon.com). Revlon has created this statement (the "Privacy Policy") to inform you of Revlon's privacy practices and the terms and conditions under which data that we collect from you on the Revlon Sites will be used, shared and otherwise treated. This Privacy Policy will also instruct you on how you can verify the accuracy, and control certain uses, of the information you provide to us on the Revlon Sites. **By accessing the Revlon Sites, you agree to be bound by the Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Accordingly, you should check the date of this Policy (which appears at the top of this page) and review any changes since the last version. If at any time you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Revlon Sites. Your continued use of the Revlon Sites constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy.**

## II. Collection and Use of Information

**A. Personally Identifiable Information**  
When you visit the Revlon Sites, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information about yourself ("PII") primarily for purposes such as i) registering on the Revlon Sites, ii) contacting us about questions, inquires or concerns, or iii) providing the service or support for which your PII was specifically requested. PII includes but is not limited to your name, mailing address, e-mail address, postal address and telephone number. (Please note that Revlon does not collect credit card, debit card or other banking information on the Site. A link is provided to DrugStore.com so visitors can purchase Revlon products. Credit card, debit card or other banking information provided to DrugStore.com during the purchase process is not made available to Revlon at anytime.) Providing PII to the Revlon Sites is on a strictly voluntary basis, however, if you opt not to provide the Revlon Sites with certain PII, you may be unable to participate in certain promotions or activities provided on the Site or receive product information or other offers. You acknowledge and agree that your provision of PII to the Revlon Sites will be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and that Revlon may use PII for the purposes stated herein (see generally Section II. C. below), including carrying out the purposes for which such information was collected. Your PII will be held by Revlon for so long as is necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, for the settlement of any potential disputes which may be raised or otherwise in accordance with legal requirements. Additionally, you agree that your PII may be shared with third parties as stated herein (see generally Section II. C. below) and you acknowledge that such third parties may not be governed by the same policies as the Revlon Sites.

**B. Non-Personally Identifiable Information**  
In some cases, the Revlon Sites may collect certain information about you that is not personally identifiable, such as your age, mailing code, make-up preferences, product and information preferences, Site pages most frequently accessed, search terms entered, the type of Internet browser or computer operating system you are using and personal characteristics and other traits ("NPII"). We may also collect NPII about your use of the Revlon Sites and other Web sites linked to the Revlon Sites, such as the domain name of the Web site from which you linked to the Revlon Sites. We use NPII to help administer the Revlon Sites and to provide information about the Sites to potential business partners and other unaffiliated entities. We reserve the right to share, sell or trade aggregated NPII with third parties. As stated earlier, NPII does not identify you individually. When NPII and PII are combined we refer to this as PII and the combined information will be treated by Revlon as PII hereunder as long as it is so combined. 

**C. Use of Your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION/SHARING of your PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION**  
When you register on one of the Revlon Sites, you will be asked to provide PII. This allows the Revlon Sites to maintain a user profile of each user so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, provide a faster method for Web visitors to submit information to Revlon (and receive information back from Revlon), notify users about important functionality changes to the Revlon Sites and about new products and services offered by Revlon and special offers that we believe users will find to be valuable, as well as generally allow us to better know our users and possibly tailor any specific features, promotions or other notifications to them. In addition, you may be asked to submit your PII when contacting us about questions, inquires or concerns or to provide services or support. When you provide PII on the Revlon sites, Revlon may store, process and use your PII in order to carry out the purpose for which such information was provided, enhance your experience on the Revlon Sites (including tailoring it to your preferences), and for the general promotion, marketing, and advertising activities related to the products and services that Revlon makes available from time to time. 

Revlon may also enhance or merge your PII with data obtained from third parties, such as information provided by a co-sponsor of a particular promotion, which Revlon may then use for marketing and advertising activities. Certain services available on the Revlon Sites may be provided by third parties, including without limitation, sub-contractors, authorized vendors, and fulfillment companies, and Revlon may provide your PII to such third parties in order to deliver the requested service to you. Revlon may also share your PII with third party service providers, such as data processors, companies who send emails on our behalf, customer support specialists, Web hosting companies, etc. These third party service providers are not authorized to retain, share, store or use your PII for any purposes other than to provide the services for which they have been hired to provide. Revlon also reserves the right share, transfer or otherwise disclose your PII with trusted third parties that Revlon believes may be able to provide you with valuable offers. If you would rather us not share your PII with the any third party for their such third parties’ direct marketing purposes, please do not submit information to the Revlon Sites or let us know by following the "Do Not Share" procedures set forth in Section IX below. In addition, you agree that Revlon may transfer, sell, assign or otherwise dispose of or encumber PII to third parties in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of all or substantially of the assets, bankruptcy, reorganization or liquidation of Revlon. In such case, you would not be entitled to any compensation arising from any such transfer, sale, assignment, disposition or encumbrance of your PII. Finally, Revlon may disclose PII when required to do so under applicable law, including but not limited to comply with a legal requirement, judicial proceeding court order or legal process served on us; to investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; or when we believe it is appropriate to do so to protect the rights, property, or safety of our company or other persons. 

You may at any time tell us that you: i) would like to review, update or have your PII deleted from Revlon’s database by following the directions in Section VII. "Reviewing, Updating or Deleting Your PII In Revlon’s Databases"; ii) would like to opt-out of receiving marketing emails or postal mail from Revlon by following the directions in Section VIII. "Opting Out Of Receiving Information From Revlon"; or iii) no longer want Revlon to share your PII with third parties for such third parties own direct marketing purposes by following the directions in Section IX. "Do Not Share List". 

PII submitted to Revlon over the Revlon Sites in connection with employment inquiries will be used only by Revlon and its employees, agents, independent contractors and/or other third parties in your application process and as may be required under applicable laws. 

**D. COOKIES**  
We may also use a technology known as "cookies" (or any other technology now existing or hereafter developed providing similar tracking benefits to Revlon) to help you travel through the Revlon Sites and other Web sites linked to the Revlon Sites more easily and to help us understand how you and others use the Revlon Sites and other Web sites linked to the Revlon Sites. Specifically, we may use cookies (or such other technology) to: i) customize your visitation and experience on the Revlon Sites and other Web sites linked to the Revlon Sites; ii) provide you with custom-tailored content; iii) notify you of certain promotions, products and services that Revlon and other companies believe may be of interest to you; and iv) for any other purpose permitted under applicable law from time to time. Cookies are used by almost every Web site for these and similar purposes. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You may, however, disallow reception of cookies at any time by resetting your web browser. Most Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. That said, parts of the Revlon Sites will not function if you do not have cookies enabled. To enable or disable cookies on your browser, please consult your browser documentation or contact your software provider. 

**E. Collection and Use of IP Addresses**  
In addition, we collect IP addresses to obtain NPII on the Site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by a web server when you are on the web. When you are on our Site, we have a back-end server that logs your computer's IP address. We only use the information we find out from tracking IP addresses in the aggregate, such as how many users entered a specific area of our Site, and not to track a specific IP address to identify an individual user. However, we reserve the right to use such information to identify a user if safety and/or security issues arise or to comply with legal requirements. 

## III. Public Forums

From time to time you may be able to participate in certain activities on the Revlon Sites, such as chat rooms or bulletin boards, which will allow you the opportunity to communicate with Revlon or other users of the Revlon Sites. Unless otherwise noted, these activities are generally accessible to all users of the Revlon Sites and any information that you post or otherwise make available through these forums will be non-confidential and known to all other users. Accordingly, please exercise discretion when using these forums and when publishing any PII in these forums. You acknowledge and agree that Revlon does not review, censor, or in any manner control the content of these forums and consequently Revlon has no liability or responsibility whatsoever for information made available through these forums and that you will be liable to Revlon for any liability that we incur as a result of any statement made by you in these forums. Your use of these forums is also subject to Revlon's [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/Revlon-Home/Revlon-Corporate/Terms.aspx). 

## IV. Security

The security of your PII is important to us and we are committed to handling your information carefully. We restrict access to your PII to employees who need to know that information in order to provide services. In addition, we make reasonable efforts to follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the PII submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your PII, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and any transmission is at your own risk. 

## V. Links to Other Sites

In an attempt to enhance the experience of visiting the Revlon Sites, Revlon may choose to link the Revlon Sites to various third party Web sites. However, Revlon may have no control over the acts or omissions of these linked Web sites, who each should have their own privacy policy and data collection practices, independent of Revlon and the Revlon Sites. Revlon has no liability or responsibility whatsoever for these linked Web sites or for their policies, practices and content. Revlon provides these links for the convenience of the visitors to the Revlon Sites and such visitors access these sites at their own risk. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and terms of use of any third-party sites or services. 

## VI. Children

Revlon is concerned about the safety of children when they use the Internet. However, the Revlon Sites are neither directed nor targeted to children under 18 years old. Revlon has no intention to knowingly collect any PII from individuals under the age of 18 years. If Revlon learns that a child under the age of 18 years has provided PII to the Revlon Sites without verifiable parental consent, Revlon will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete such information from its databases. If you believe your child, who is under 18, has submitted PII to the Revlon Sites, please contact us via one of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/Revlon-Home/Revlon-General/Contact.aspx) page. We strongly encourage parents to monitor their children's use of the Web. 

## VII. REVIEWING, UPDATING OR DELETING YOUR PII IN REVLON’S DATABASES

If you have previously submitted PII to Revlon through the Revlon Sites, and you would like to review, update, or have your PII deleted from our databases, please contact us via one of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/Revlon-Home/Revlon-General/Contact.aspx) page, and be sure to include complete information so that we can respond to your request: Please note that if you ask us to remove your PII from our database, we may, however, maintain your name or other necessary PII in a "do not mail" file to help us ensure that we can honor your request. Please note that we may share your PII with third parties, or otherwise transfer, sell, assign, dispose of or encumber your PII, prior to receiving your correspondence and we will not undertake any effort to cause such third parties with whom we have shared your PII or to whom we have transferred, sold, assigned, disposed of or encumbered your PII, to delete or update your PII, so if this concerns you, you should not share your PII with the Revlon Sites. 

## VIII. OptING-Out OF RECEIVING INFORMATION FROM revlon

If you prefer not to receive marketing e-mails from Revlon, please let us know by i) contacting us through one of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/Revlon-Home/Revlon-General/Contact.aspx) page ii) by clicking on the unsubscribe link within any marketing e-mail you receive from us; or iii) by unselecting the subscribe box on your profile page. Please note that such requests may take up to ten (10) days to become effective. 

Because information submitted in connection with employment inquiries is used only in the application process and not for marketing purposes, the procedures outlined in this section are not available with respect to such information. 

## IX. DO NOT SHARE LIST

If you do not wish to have PII collected at our Sites shared with third-party organizations for their own direct marketing or promotional purposes, you can have your name placed on a "do-not-share" list by sending a request to us through one of the methods described on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/Revlon-Home/Revlon-General/Contact.aspx) page. Please be sure to include complete information so we can respond to your request: If we have received your "do not share" request after having shared, transferred or otherwise disclosed your PII to a third party, Revlon may not have any ability to control the use of such data by such third party (and we undertake no obligation to do so), so you agree that Revlon will have no responsibility or liability whatsoever as a result of the use of such data by such third party. You also agree that Revlon shall have no responsibility, obligation or liability to you for sharing, transferring or otherwise disclosing your PII with third parties prior to Revlon's implementing your "Do Not Share" notification. Therefore, if you are concerned about Revlon sharing, disclosing or transferring your PII to third parties, you should not provide such information to Revlon.

Because information submitted in connection with employment inquiries is used only in the application process and not for marketing purposes, the procedures outlined in this section are not available with respect to such information
