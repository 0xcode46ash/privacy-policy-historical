## Delivery

**FOR A LIMITED TIME ONLY WE HAVE  FREE SHIPPING ON ALL ORDERS WITHIN AUSTRALIA! ** 

Within Australia, Review Australia Pty Ltd (“Review”)  sends parcels via the Australia Post E-Parcel service so please allow 3-5 days for delivery.

A signature is required upon delivery so please select an address where someone is available during business hours to receive your purchase. If for some reason your parcel cannot be delivered, a card will be left and you will then be required to pick up your parcel at the designated Australia Post Office marked on the card. Once the order has been dispatched, your tracking details will be emailed to you.

For International orders, we send our parcels via Australia Post International Registered Post service. Please allow 5-10 working days for delivery. New Zealand orders are a flat rate of $9.95. And for all other international orders we charge a flat rate of $25.00.

For express post orders, a signature is not required and the parcel will be left at your designated premises.

## Returns

This policy only applies to items purchased from Review online, and we will only accept returns purchased from our online store. For refunds, exchanges or returns for items purchased at a Myer Concession or boutique, please go to that store directly. Please be aware that Review retail stores have different Terms & Conditions of sale than those of the Review online store. For more information regarding Review store terms and conditions please contact our customer care department- **[enquiries@review-australia.com](mailto:enquiries@review-australia.com) **or enquire in store.

Review reserves the right to assess the condition and age of all returned items and this may result in items not being accepted for return, exchange, refund or repair.

Please note that Review fabrics are delicate so please follow the instructions on the garment care label.

**Exchanges & Returns**

We appreciate it's not always easy buying the perfect garment online and we understand that you may need to return or exchange items occasionally. You may return or exchange your online purchase to a Review Boutique store or post it back to our online store. Myer Concessions and Review Outlet Stores are unable to accept online returns.  

We are happy to accept returns that have not been worn or used and have the original tags still attached. On receiving your returned item we will gladly send you a replacement garment if it’s available or refund your purchase price (excluding the freight fee).

Please return your item(s) within 14 days of receiving your order. After 30 days, Review cannot accept returns for any reason other than manufacturing defects (detailed further below).
