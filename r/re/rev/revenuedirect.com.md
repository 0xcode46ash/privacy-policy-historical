This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for RevenueDirect ("RevenueDirect," "We" or "Us") and how it treats the information that RevenueDirect collects and receives, including information related to your past use of RevenueDirect services.

**1 Information Collected by RevenueDirect**  
We will not knowingly disseminate information collected on this website to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. RevenueDirect collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

For purposes of this Privacy Statement, "Personally Identifiable Information" refers to information that can directly identify an individual; for example, such information may include an individual's name, mailing address, phone number or email address.

1.1 Information that Is Automatically Collected  
We use IP addresses, with the help of a business partner, to analyze trends, administer the website, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information.

1.2 Information that Is Collected by Cookies  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on a user's hard drive containing information about that user. By setting a cookie on our website, the user would not have to log in with a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our website. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our website. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our website. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our website. Some of our business partners use cookies on our website (for example, advertisers); however, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

1.3 Information that Is Actively Submitted to RevenueDirect  
Sign-Up & Domain Monetization. In order to sign up for a RevenueDirect account, a user must create an account and complete a registration process. During the account creation process, a user must provide contact information (such as name and email address) so that we can stay in touch with the user. This information is also used to fulfill registration and support requests.

**2 Communications from RevenueDirect**  
Welcome Emails and General Correspondence. We may send a welcoming email to the email address associated with the account a user has created to verify the user's password and username. This process is designed to prevent email addresses from being used without permission in the creation of a RevenueDirect account. Established users will occasionally receive information on new announcements related to the service.

Communicating with Our Customers. We use Personally Identifiable Information (such as your name, telephone number or email address) to communicate with our customers when they have questions, concerns or comments about their accounts or the services that we provide. If you contact us, we may or may not delete your emails or voicemails to us.

Addressing Legal Issues. Further, we provide Personally Identifiable Information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. Further, we believe it is necessary to share Personally Identifiable Information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of RevenueDirect's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

**3 Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
Users must provide accurate and correct contact information (name, postal address, email address, phone number) for their domain name(s) Registrant, Administrative, Technical and Billing contacts, which will be listed in a publicly accessible 'Whois' database, in compliance with ICANN rules. If a user's Personally Identifiable Information changes (such as a zip code), or if a user no longer desires RevenueDirect's services, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done under online account management (on your own) or by emailing our user Support Group for assistance.

**4 Terminated RevenueDirect Accounts**  
If your RevenueDirect account is terminated or cancelled (regardless of whether it was voluntary), all of your Personally Identifiable Information will remain on our servers. We retain and use your Personally Identifiable Information as necessary to enforce our policies or to address contractual issues, and may contact you for future marketing or promotional purposes.

**5 Use of the RevenueDirect Website by Persons Under Age 13**  
This website is not intended for use by anyone under the age of thirteen (13), and any individual under such age should not provide us with Personally Identifiable Information. We do not knowingly contact, market to, solicit, collect or use Personally Identifiable Information from or about any individual under the age of 13. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of that we have personal information regarding a person under the age of 13, as soon as we reasonably verify the information, we will either obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from the account and/or service. However, the information may remain on a log in our servers. If you want to notify us of our receipt of information by children under 13, please do so by emailing us at: [info@RevenueDirect.com](mailto:info@revenuedirect.com).

**6 Linking to Third Party Websites**  
This website contains links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our website and to read the Privacy Statements of each and every website that collects Personally Identifiable Information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by this website.

**7 Users Must Keep Their Passwords Private**  
Users are required to keep their account passwords confidential and to not share this information with others. If you choose to reveal or share your password and RevenueDirect account name, we are unable to guarantee the security of your account.

**8 Changes to Our Privacy Statement**  
This Privacy Statement may change, and use of information that we gather now is subject to the Privacy Statement that is in effect as of the time of use. You are responsible for periodically checking our Privacy Statement. You may opt-out of any posted change to our collection, use or disclosure of your personal information by sending an email to [info@RevenueDirect.com](mailto:info@revenuedirect.com). If we make minor changes to this Privacy Statement, the changes will be immediately effective upon posting the revised Privacy Statement to the website. If we make material changes to this Privacy Statement or in how we will use or collect your Personally Identifiable Information, we will prominently post a notification on our website of the changed Privacy Statement ten (10) days prior to implementing the change. The date at the bottom of this Privacy Statement is the date that the Privacy Statement is effective.

**9 Final Statement**  
RevenueDirect will use your information in accordance with the Privacy Statement that is currently in effect. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to [info@RevenueDirect.com](mailto:info@revenuedirect.com).
