Our Company Departments can be contacted using the following options:

Using the login link found at revup31.com log in with your username and password that is assigned to you once your Trial begins. You will find a "Support" text link at the bottom of every page on this Members web site.

For each visitor to our Web site, our Web server automatically recognizes the visitor's IP address.

We collect user-specific information on what pages visitors access or visit. We also collect information volunteered by the visitor, such as survey information and/or site registrations.

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web page, used to customize the content and/or layout of our page for each individual visitor, and to provide further information regarding RevUp31 through the form of email communication.

### With respect to email

The only way a visitor will be added to our email distribution list is by voluntarily entering their contact information in one of our site registration forms. We have in place a "Verified Double Opt-In" policy whereby all registrations are confirmed by means of return email. In the case where a registration is not confirmed, the unconfirmed registrations will only receive periodic emails reminding the visitor of their need to verify their registration, otherwise, if the confirmation of registration is received, they are considered a "confirmed" recipient.

If a visitor does not want to receive e-mail from us in the future, they simply need to click the unsubscribe link found in just one of the emails that they have received from us. Additionally they can let us know by sending an e-mail to the above address or writing to us at the above address.

### With respect to cookies

We use cookies to record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, record past activity at a site in order to provide better service when visitors return to our site, customize Web page content based on visitors' browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

If you supply us with your postal address on-line you will only receive the information for which you provided us your address.

Persons who supply us with their telephone numbers on-line will only receive telephone contact from us for which you provided us your phone number.

### With respect to Ad Servers

We do not partner with or have special relationships with any ad server companies.

### With respect to security

We take precaution to protect our Subscribers and Members information. When Subscribers and Members submit sensitive information via this Web Site, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order forms ask Subscribers and Members to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number, billing information, etc.), that information is encrypted and is protected using industry standard encryption software (128 bit secure socket layers protocols).

While we use SSL encryption protocols to protect sensitive information online, we also employ security measures to protect Subscribers and Members information off-line. All of our Subscriber and Member information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

If you feel that this site is not following its stated information policy, you may contact us at the above addresses.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding any of these policies please don't hesitate to contact us.
