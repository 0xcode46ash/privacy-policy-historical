## Privacy Statement

**EFFECTIVE DATE:**

The most recent version of this Privacy Policy is effective as of October 1, 2005.

#### 1\. Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to Revver, Inc. (“Revver”) and/or other affiliated entities controlled by, or under common control with and through Revver (each such web site being individually referred to herein as the “Web Site”). Revver respects the privacy of its users, and this Privacy Policy explains what information we collect on our Web Site and how we use such information. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. In addition, please review the Terms of Use posted at the Web Site, which governs your use of the Web Site. Your use of our Web Site indicates to us that you have read and accepted our privacy practices, as outlined in this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use. 

#### 2\. Applicability 

Please note that this Privacy Policy only applies to Web Sites owned and/or operated by or for Revver, and upon which Revver has placed a “link” which, when “clicked”, transfers you to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy only covers information collected at this Web Site, and does not cover any information collected by any other web site (unless otherwise specifically stated or disclosed by Revver), its corporate affiliates, licensees or any other company. 

#### 3\. Information Revver Collects

(a) Personally Identifiable Information: Personal Information is information that could reasonably be used to identify you personally (such as your name, address, birth date or e-mail address), which we refer to in this Privacy Policy as “PI.” Generally, you may browse our Web Site without providing us with PI. However, there may be times when we ask you to provide us with certain PI, such as when you choose to register with our Web Site or post a video. We may also ask you to provide us with demographic information or information regarding your interests, hobbies or similar information to enhance your viewing experience. Revver reserves the right, at any time, to add features to our Web Site that require you to register or otherwise provide additional PI or to require registration to access our Web Site. You can choose not to provide certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in some of the Web Site’s features. Revver does not sell, rent or share PI collected with other people other than that specifically outlined herein. 

(b) The Web Site does not knowingly collect PI from children under thirteen (13) years of age:

This is not a Web site directed to children under the age of 13, and therefore Revver does not knowingly collect any information from children under 13 years of age at the Web Site. If you are under 13 years of age, do not send any information about yourself to Revver. If Revver discovers that a child under the age of 13 has provided the Web Site with PI, Revver will delete that child’s PI from its system. 

(c) Anonymous Information: When you visit the Web Site, our web servers automatically collect Web Site usage information. Web site usage information is anonymous information that describes how our visitors use and navigate our Web Site, and it includes the number and frequency of visitors to each web page, video and the length of their stays. We collect the anonymous information automatically sent to us by your web browser, such as browser type, referrer data that identifies the web page visited prior and subsequent to visiting our Web Site, and IP address. We may also determine what technology is available through your browser in order to serve you the most appropriate version of a web page (i.e. Flash or HTML). 

(d) IP Addresses: When visitors request pages from our Web Site, our servers log the visitor’s IP address. We may collect IP addresses for a variety of internal purposes, such as system administration, to report aggregate information to our business partners or to audit the number of visits to different pages or videos watched on our Web Site. 

(e) Cookies: We do not store any PI in cookies, but we may link the cookie to any information we collect. You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers, which is standard in the Internet industry. We do not control these cookies, and these cookies are not subject to our privacy policy. Visitors to our Website should check the privacy policy of the advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies. You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of the Web Site will not operate correctly if you disable cookies.

(b) Third parties providing services on our behalf: Revver may employ other trusted companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples may include analyzing data, providing marketing assistance and providing customer service. These third parties may have access to our users’ PI in order to provide these services to us on our behalf solely of such purposes however, they are not permitted to use it for any other purpose.
