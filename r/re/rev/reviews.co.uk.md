# Privacy Policy | Reviews.co.uk

**User Anonymity**

Anonymous information may be disclosed at times regarding facts about user patterns. This information will only represent user statistics for advertising purposes. We do not know what you search for on search engines. We only know what you search for within our site.

**Bank and Credit Card Information**

If you have written a review, we do not need any private banking details from you. The only details we ask for are a name and email address to confirm that you are a real user. We will never gain access to your credit card number. If you do choose to purchase something by clicking through to one of our retailers, we will not see any of your private information including banking details or credit card numbers.

**18 or Older Please**

We require our users to be 18 or older and anyone using the site must adhere to this rule. We never knowingly allow children under 18 to post personal information on our site.

**Cookies**

A cookie does not identify a user, rather the user's computer. The homepage on Reviews.co.uk uses cookies by storing a small file on your computer. While you are free to disable your cookies at any time, know that they help us to to enable anonymous stats on website use.

If at any point we update any of our privacy policies, we will make it known on our homepage for at least one week. By continuing to use the Reviews.co.uk site, you are consenting to the privacy policy and updates.

You may also contact us by postal mail at: **  Forresters Building, Leicester, LE1 4LD, England.**

**Your Customer List  **

Your subscriber lists are stored on a secure Review.co.uk server. We don’t, under any circumstances, sell your lists, contact people on your lists, market to people on your lists, steal your lists, or share your lists with any other party, unless it’s required by law. If someone on your list complains or contacts us, we may then contact that person.

**Safegaurding Your Information**

To protect your information, our credit card processing vendor uses the latest 128-bit Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology for secure transactions. Our vendor is certified as compliant with card association security initiatives, like the Visa Cardholder Information Security and Compliance (CISP), MasterCard® (SDP), and Paypal.

Reviews.co.uk accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and  _never_  disclose it to a third party. Because the information in your Distribution Lists is so sensitive, account passwords are encrypted, which means we can’t see your passwords. We can’t resend forgotten passwords either. We’ll only reset them.
