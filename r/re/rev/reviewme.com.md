# HR One

HR One, Inc. (“HR One”) has a firm commitment to securing the privacy of your information. Through the use of our products and services, you have access to a wide range of information and tools necessary to manage and motivate your people. To make the full benefit of our information and tools available to you, we request and obtain information from and about you and your company, business or organization. This privacy policy (the “Policy”) was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our visitors and the companies, businesses and organizations they represent (collectively, “you”). IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THE HR ONE WEB SITE (THE “SITE”). 

**I. Information**  


HR One obtains information from and about you in order to tailor our services to your needs and deliver content-specific information for your interests. This information is sometimes “personal” (that is, information that may be personally identifiable to a particular user of the Site) and other times “general” (information not identifiable to a particular user). HR One is the sole owner of all information (personal and general) collected on the Site[, unless otherwise indicated with respect to your personal information stored in the HR Desktop]. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in the Policy. 

A. _Personal Information_  


HR One obtains personal information from and about our users at several different points on the Site.

_1) Registration for Membership--_  
There are two kinds of visitors to the Site: registered (“members”) and unregistered (non-members). All visitors have access to some portions of the Site. Non-members can shop for products, but not purchase, can use Quick Polls, Live Assistance, read Articles, Quick Tips, Free Subscriptions, Ask the Advisor and view the Events Calander, TSCentral, in the community. Members has access to all of these, in addition to, Archived Polls, Achieved Articles and the Brainstorming discussion forum.

We do ask you to register, however, when you decide you’re ready to start using certain features of the Site. These features require you to enter personal or company data. Registration is the only way we can offer you a secure service that fully protects your data, as well as the privacy of other members.

During registration a visitor is required to give their individual and company contact information (such as name and email address). We use this information to send you information about our company and to contact you about the products and services on the Site. We also require visitors who are registering to provide information about their company. This information is used for the purpose of providing HR related services to the company. It is optional for the visitor to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on the Site. 

_2) Ordering Products and Services--_  
We request additional information from any visitor who decides to purchase a product or service on the Site. This additional information is required on our order form for the particular product or service. Here you must provide contact information (like name and shipping address) and financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your order. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you. [When purchasing an item using a credit/purchasing card, you are given the option of saving your information so that you do not need to type it in each time you make a purchase. Choosing this option will save your credit/purchasing card information within your account in our database.]  


_3) HR Desktop--_  
HROne’s HR Desktop requires company data and employee information to help administer your company’s human resources needs. This information includes contact information (like name and email address), unique identifiers (like social security number), financial information (like account and credit card numbers and payroll and benefits information) and demographic information (like zip code, age, income level).  


HR Desktop uses a hierarchical security model with three security levels: HR/Exec, Managing Employee and Non-Managing Employee. HR/Execs can edit their personal information and the personal information of the Employees they manage from the Employee Records section of the HR Desktop and also control and are responsible for all configuration options, such as approving manager-level access and setting up a company handbook. Managing Employees cans access the employee records and performance reviews of the employees they manage. Non-Managing Employees can access features such as the Company Directory and Bulletin Board. 

_4) Community Features--_  
The Community is the interactive discussion side of the Site. Here, HR One hosts forums, message boards and discussion groups for the use of our visitors, and the participation of our registered members. Please remember that any information disclosed in these areas becomes public. Obviously, you should keep that in mind and exercise caution when deciding to disclose anything about yourself on the community side.

_5) Newsletter--_  
If you wish to subscribe to our email newsletter, we ask for contact information such as your name and email address. 

_6) Surveys, Polls & Contests--_  
From time-to-time we request information from visitors via surveys, polls or contests. Participation in these surveys, polls or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). 

_7) Tell-A-Friend--_

B. _Cookies_  


Cookies are pieces of information transferred for record-keeping purposes to your computer’s hard disk by a website. They allow the Site to store information about your preferences, making the Site more useful to you. Many major sites use cookies; in fact, they are used throughout the Internet industry to offer personalized services.

Most browsers are automatically set to accept cookies; HR One uses your browser for a cookie of its own. Each time you use the Site, this cookie is accessed. That way, we can track the features you use and the pages and content that you view on the Site to help personalize your experience.

The use of a “cookie” also lets you automatically log-in to the Site so that you do not have to reenter your username and/or password each time you visit.

Other HR One partners that offer products or services on the Site may use cookies to collect other information about you. Be sure that we’re committed to doing business with other companies that mirror our stringent privacy policies. But HR One doesn’t control the collection or use of information by these companies. If you have questions about how they handle their information, we encourage you to contact them directly.

If, for any reason, you would rather not make use of the benefits made possible via cookies, most browsers will let you reject them, or to select which cookies to accept. Be aware though, that by disabling cookie support on your browser, you will lose certain features that require a cookie to work properly.

C. _IP Addresses_  


We automatically capture the Internet Protocol (IP) address and host name (if available) of your originating server. The IP address identifies the server you are working on, but does not reveal any personal information about you. We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, assist with customer support, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. 

D. _Supplementation of Information_

We may supplement the information we receive from you with information from third-party sources. 

**II. Use and Disclosure of Information**  


A. _General Information_  


HR One uses and discloses general information about our visitors to understand Site demographics and content preferences. We may share aggregate information about our visitors, sales, Site traffic patterns and related information to our business partners, affiliates or other third parties.

B. _Personal Information_  


Except as described below, HR One will not willfully disclose any personal information about you to any third party without first receiving your permission. In all cases, we may disclose or use your personal information when we are legally compelled to do so, or when we, in good faith, believe that the law requires it, or for the protection of our rights. 

_HR Desktop_  
HR One will keep all personal information obtained through use of the HR Desktop private and will not willfully disclose it to any third party, including HR One’s business partners and affiliates, without first receiving your permission. 

_Registration and Other Information_  
HR One uses and discloses to our business partners and affiliates personal information obtained through the registration process and other features of the Site for purposes of administering business activities, providing customer service and making available other products and services from HR One and those business partners and affiliates to you. This may include focused advertising, online banner advertisements, new services, promotions and other responses to you. We may also use and disclose your personal information to notify you about important changes to the Site or our business, new HR One services and special offers that you may find valuable. 

We may also enter into agreements with third parties who may be given access to your personal information for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services that we think will be of interest to you. 

We partner with other parties to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share your name or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. [These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information except for the purpose of providing these services.]

We use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill customers for products and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use your personal information for any secondary purposes.

**III. Security**  


HR One is committed to protecting the personal information you provide to us. When you submit sensitive information via the Site, your information is protected both online and off-line by state-of-the-art, industry-standard technology.

When our registration/order form asks your to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with what we believe to be the best encryption software in the industry--SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’. To learn more about SSL, follow this link [www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html](http://www.zdwebopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html) . 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect your personal information off-line. All of our visitors’ personal information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. All employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers’ information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personal information on are kept in a secure environment, which utilizes surveillance cameras, motion sensors, biometric identification systems and other intrusion-detection measures.

Your access to some services and content is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. HR One will never ask for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. You should not disclose your user name or password to others. 

If you have any questions about the security at the Site, you can send an email to [tcs@HROne.com](mailto:tcs@HROne.com).

**IV. Links to Third-Party Web Sites**  


The Site contains links to other web sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave the Site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. The Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site.

**V. Correcting/Updating Personal Information**  


If your personal information changes (such as your zip code), or if you no longer desire our service, we will try to provide a way to correct, update or remove from our database the personal information that you provided to us. This can be done at the [My Profile] page or by emailing us at [tcs@HROne.com](mailto:tcs@HROne.com).

**VI. Choice/Opt-out**  


We give you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personal information used for purposes not directly related to the Site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, during registration, you will be asked if you want to receive information from HR One, our partners and affiliates or other select companies. If you do not want us to use your name and email address for marketing or special promotions, just make sure the appropriate boxes are not checked. If you change your mind later, you can visit the [My Profile] page at any time to change your selection. You are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about our services.

Visitors who no longer wish to receive our email newsletter may opt-out of receiving the newsletter by replying to unsubscribe in the subject line in the email, by visiting the [My Profile] page to change your selection or by emailing us at [tcs@HROne.com](mailto:tcs@HROne.com).

Please note that HR One is not responsible for removing information from third-party lists with which you previously authorized us to share your contact information.

**VII. Notification of Changes**  


If we decide to change the Policy, we will post those changes on this page so our visitors are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you via your preferred method of contact, as indicated at the time of registration. You will have a choice as to whether or not we use your personal information in this different manner. We will not use your personal information in a manner that is different than stated at the time of collection without receiving your written or email permission.
