# Privacy Policy - Revel Systems - iPad POS System

## Revel Systems Privacy Policy

Your privacy is critically important to us. At Revel Systems we have set out a few fundamental principles in our Privacy Policy:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.



Revel Systems Inc. (“ **Revel Systems** ”) operates several websites including but not limited to RevelSystems.com, revelution.com, revelup.com. It is Revel Systems’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Revel Systems collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Revel Systems’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Revel Systems’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Revel Systems may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Revel Systems also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on revelup.com blogs or store. Revel Systems only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Revel Systems’s websites choose to interact with Revel Systems in ways that require Revel Systems to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Revel Systems gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for a blog or the store at revelup.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Revel Systems – by purchasing access to the Akismet comment spam prevention service, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Revel Systems collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Revel Systems. Revel Systems does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

### Aggregated Statistics

Revel Systems may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Revel Systems may monitor the most popular blogs or pages on the revelup.com site or use spam screened by the Akismet service to help identify spam. Revel Systems may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Revel Systems does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Revel Systems discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Revel Systems’s behalf or to provide services available at Revel Systems’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Revel Systems’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Revel Systems will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Revel Systems discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Revel Systems believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Revel Systems, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Revel Systems website and have supplied your email address, Revel Systems may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Revel Systems and our products. We primarily use our various product pages and blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Revel Systems takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Revel Systems uses cookies to help Revel Systems identify and track visitors, their usage of Revel Systems website, and their website access preferences. Revel Systems visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Revel Systems’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Revel Systems’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

### Business Transfers

If Revel Systems, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Revel Systems goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Revel Systems may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Revel Systems and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

### Comments

Comments and other content submitted to our Akismet anti-spam service are not saved on our servers unless they were marked as false positives, in which case we store them long enough to use them to improve the service to avoid future false positives.

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Revel Systems may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Revel Systems’s sole discretion. Revel Systems encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a WordPress.com account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
