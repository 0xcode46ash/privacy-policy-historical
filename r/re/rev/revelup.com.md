## Privacy Policy

## Revel Systems, Inc. Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: June 17, 2016**  
This Privacy Policy applies to all products and services offered by Revel Systems, Inc. and our affiliates (collectively “Revel”, “we”, “us” or “our”), including our websites, products, services, mobile and software applications we own or control (the “Services”). Our Privacy Policy does not apply to services offered by other companies or individuals.

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it and what we do with it. We have set out a few fundamental principles in our Privacy Policy:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop or improve our products and services, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our Services.



### How We Collect Information

#### Information You Provide

We collect information you provide when you access or participate in certain aspects of our Services, such as when you create any type of account, use our Services, making purchases, leaving a review, download one of our mobile applications, complete a survey, or enter contests or other promotions. The information you provide may specifically identify you (“Personally Identifying Information”), and includes: your name, email address, postal mailing address, business address, telephone numbers, payment information (including payment card numbers). The amount and type of information you provide depends on the nature of the interaction. You may always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent you from using our corresponding Services.

In addition to Personally Identifying Information, you may provide information about you, but does not identify you, such as your age, gender, zip code, interests, preferences with respect to our Services.

#### Information Automatically Collected By Using Or Accessing Our Services

When you access, use or interact with our Services, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Revel may also collect potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses.

##### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s devices. We use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our Services, and their preferences. Revel visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their devices should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our Services, with the drawback that certain features of our Services may not be available or may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

##### Device Information and Identifiers, and Location Information

When you use our Services, including but not limited to when you install software, download any type of Services or access the Services, on your computer, tablet, mobile device or any other devices, we collect device-specific identifiers and mobile network information including phone number, device type, device identifier and operating system. When you use our Services, including but not limited to when you download or use one of our mobile applications or access the Services, we may collect information about your location. We may also request access to certain rights on your devices, such as access to storage or camera, and ability to send push notifications.

We use the information we collect from all of our Services to provide, maintain, use, protect and improve our Services, and to develop new products and services. We also use the information to protect our users and customers and to provide you with personalized experience of our Services.

We may also use information to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our rights. We retain all information we collect about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

#### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Revel discloses potentially personally-identifying and Personally-Identifying Information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that

  1. need that information in connection with the Services, and
  2. that have agreed not to disclose it to others.



Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Services, you consent to the transfer of such information to them to the extent permissible under applicable law. Other than to the employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, we disclose potentially personally-identifying and Personally-Identifying Information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Revel believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Revel, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of any of our Services and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Revel and our products and our Services. Revel takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and Personally-Identifying Information.

#### Aggregated Statistics

We may collect statistics about the use of our Services. In addition, we share anonymous information, including aggregated non-Personally Identifying Information, and share such anonymous information with third parties, and we may also share such anonymous information publicly to provide information about the general use of our Services.

### Ads

Ads appearing on any of our Services may be delivered to users by third parties, who may set cookies or use device identifiers (see additional information above). These cookies or device identifiers allow the ad server to recognize your device and to compile information about the use of our Services. This information may allow us or third parties to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements or promotions that may be of interest to you. 

### Registration via Third Party Accounts and Social Media Sharing

You may be given the opportunity to register with us or use our Services via third party accounts such as Google, Apple or Facebook. These services will authenticate your identity and may provide you the option to share certain information (such as your name and email address) with us. We may store the information you provide us through such accounts and combine it with other information, including Personally Identifying Information. Disabling your Facebook or other such account may not terminate your relationship with us.

Our Services may also include social media features, such as sharing widgets provided by Facebook, Twitter, Google and Pinterest. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting within our Services, and may set cookies. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly within our Services. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Revel may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
