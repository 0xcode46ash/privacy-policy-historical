# Revolut - Simply Revolutionary - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

#### This policy was last modified on March 9, 2015.

It explains how the Revolut LTD (“Revolut,” “we,” or “us”) collects, uses, shares, and keeps secure your information when you use our mobile application (“App”), our website (“Site”), and other online products and services that link to this privacy policy (collectively, the “Services”). By using our Services you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy. We may change this privacy policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email notification). We encourage you to review the privacy policy periodically to stay informed about our practices and the ways you can help protect your privacy. 

#### What information do we collect directly from you?

When you sign up for the Revolut App, we are required by law to verify your identity. We also collect various types of information to establish and maintain your account. As a result, we collect your name, email address, phone number, permanent address and/or mailing address, date of birth, bank account number, sort-code, IBAN, credit card number, debit card number, and, occasionally, your passport and driving license information. We also collect information from you when you register on our site, subscribe to our newsletter, or respond to a survey. 

#### What information do we collect indirectly?

As a result of completing a transaction, currency exchange or money transfer using Revolut, we also collect information such as the time, amount, currency, location, and other details about the parties involved in the transaction. Revolut App will also collect your geolocation information in order to show you offers available in your location, and send you reminders about our Services. 

#### What information do we collect from third parties?

The Revolut App also collects your contacts information from your phone’s address book and Facebook when you request the App to execute money transfers. After you have requested the Revolut App to add your Facebook friends or phone book contacts, the App will periodically recollect this information in order to stay up-to-date. When using our Services, you may have the option to provide us with information from other third parties, such as Twitter and Google. We may also acquire information about you from third parties in order to verify your identity, process your transactions, detect and prevent fraud, or other similar purposes. 

#### Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?

We use various technologies to collect and store information related to your use of our Services. We use these technologies to personalize our Services and to collect information about usage of our Services in order to improve them.   
We may collect and store information locally on your device. We may also use cookies. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computers hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.   
We may also collect information using web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”). Web beacons are electronic images that may be used in our Service or emails and help deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and determine whether an email has been opened and acted upon.   
Although you may have Do Not Track enabled in your browser, Revolut may still set cookies to reduce fraud and help you use our Services. To learn more about limiting the sharing of data, please see “Your Choices” below. 

#### Do we collect children's information?

Revolut does not knowingly collect or solicit any information from any individual under the age of thirteen without parental or guardian consent. We do not direct any of our business practices or system outputs towards children under the age of thirteen.   
If we are notified or have any other reason to believe that we have collected personal information from or about a child under the age of thirteen, Revolut will promptly delete the information and any account associated with that information.

**Third Party Sites** : If you open a Revolut account directly on a third party website or via a third party application, any information that you enter on that website or application (and not directly on a Revolut website) will be shared with the owner of the third party website or application. These sites are governed by their own privacy policies and you are encouraged to review their privacy policies before providing them with personal information. Revolut is not responsible for the content or information practices of such third parties. 

#### How do we secure your personal information?

Security is extremely important to us. We take all reasonable measures to protect information about you from loss, theft, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction, including industry standard security and encryption features. 

No method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. If you notice a bug or vulnerability, please let us know by submitting bugs to [developer@revolut.com](mailto:developer@revolut.com). In the unlikely scenario that your personal information is compromised due to a data breach, we will take all reasonable steps to remedy the breach and notify you as soon as possible.   
Despite our efforts to keep your information secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information. As a result, we strongly encourage you to take action to protect your personal data and any device you use to access the Revolut Services. In the unlikely event that we come to learn that either our system or your account specifically has suffered a security breach, we may attempt to notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate steps, by email, text message, phone call, a notice on the Revolut website, or any other way, depending on the requirements of applicable law. 

#### How can you prevent collection of your personal information?

Revolut collects information regarding your location. You may be able to prevent this collection through your device operating system settings or by following the standard uninstall process to remove our mobile application from your device. Also, you can restrict Revolut’s collection of contact and geolocation information by changing your phone’s privacy settings. On iPhone, go to Settings > Privacy > Contacts, and Settling > Privacy > Location, and switch Revolut to “Off.” Similarly, you may be able to control how your browser interacts with cookies. 

#### Your California Privacy Rights

California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please contact us at [legal@revolut.com](mailto:legal@revolut.com). However, please note that under the law, services such as ours that permit California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing are not required to provide such information upon receiving a request, but rather may respond by notifying the user of his or her right to prevent the disclosure. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please contact us at [legal@revolut.com](mailto:legal@revolut.com). 

#### How do we use “Do Not Track” Instructions?

#### How can you delete your account?

If you no longer wish to use the Revolut Services and would like to delete or deactivate your Revolut account, please contact us. We are required by law to retain your information, and may also do so for legitimate business purposes, but we will not share or use your information for promotional and marketing purposes after you have deleted or deactivated your account. 

As stated above, your usage of the Revolut Services is contingent on your expressly opting in to this Privacy Policy. If you change your mind after agreeing and wish to opt out at a later date, you must contact us to cancel your Revolut Account. You can do so by deactivating your account in the app, or sending an email to [support@revolut.com](mailto:support@revolut.com).
