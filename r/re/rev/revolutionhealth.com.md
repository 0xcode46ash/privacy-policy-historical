Revolution LLC Privacy Policy

Revolution(s) LLC recognizes that your privacy is important to you. Your privacy is also important to us. This Privacy Policy and Agreement ("Privacy Policy") will tell you what information we collect about you and your use of our Web Site, how we use that information, and how we share it with others. Whenever this Privacy Policy refers to "we", "our", or "us", it is referring to this Web Site. By using the Site, you agree to be bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy. 

Part One: Information Collection and Use

Collecting Personal Information. Personal information is information that can be used to identify you or contact you. In general, you can visit www.revolution.com without providing any personal information. Some sections of our Site invite you to register with us in order to receive our press releases or other company news, or to contact us for more information. In these cases we will request your first and last name and e-mail address and use them to send you the information you requested from us. If you decide that you no longer want to receive e-mail from us, you can ask us to remove you from our mailing list by contacting us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this Privacy Policy. You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the e-mail address you provide to us. If your information is outdated or inaccurate, we may not be able to send you e-mails or notify you about changes to this Privacy Policy. 

Collecting Non-Personal Information. We automatically collect Web page request, Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, browser language, and the date and time of your request. This information allows us to become more familiar with visitors to our site, how often they visit, and what parts of the site they visit most frequently. 

Cookies and Web beacons. We do not use cookies or Web beacons on our Web Site or in our electronic communications. 

Children. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. This Web Site is a general audience site and not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. 

Part Two: Disclosure of Personal Information

Disclosure of Your Personal Information. This Site will not disclose any personal information you submit through the Site to third parties except as described in this Privacy Policy or unless you specifically agree to the disclosure. 

Disclosure for Legal Reasons. We may release personal information to third parties: (1) to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order; or (2) in special cases, such as a physical threat to you, others or to homeland security, in which we believe it is reasonably necessary to investigate or prevent harm, fraud, abuse, or illegal conduct. In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personal information to a third party, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you unless doing so would violate the law or court order. 

Disclosure to Operations and Maintenance Contractors. We may contract with third parties to maintain or provide services to or on behalf of the Site or our business. These contractors include vendors and suppliers that provide us with technology, services, and/or content related to better operation and maintenance of our Web Site and others, such as our attorneys and auditors. Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the contractor to perform its limited function for or on behalf of this Site. 

Disclosure to Linked Sites. For your convenience this Site may provide links to Web Sites operated by companies owned by or affiliated with Revolution LLC. This Site does not disclose your personal information to affiliated Web Sites. 

Disclosure of Aggregate Information. We may share aggregated information collected on this Site with third parties. Aggregated information is information about users that is combined into groups so that no individual user can be identified. Depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for this aggregated information. We also may not limit the third parties' use of the aggregated information. 

Changes in Our Corporate Structure. If all or part of our company is sold, merged or otherwise transferred to another entity, the personal information you have provided at this Site may be transferred as part of that transaction. This Site will take steps to assure that, without your consent, any personal information that is transferred will not be used or shared in a manner inconsistent with the Web Site privacy policy under which it was collected. 

Part Three: Security

Security. We take appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. Only a limited number of employees have access to your personal information. These employees must abide by our Privacy Policy and those who violate the Privacy Policy are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Although we will make reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the Internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems.
