### Controllers of personal information

Any personal information provided or to be gathered at redletterdays.co.uk is controlled by Red Letter Days, 77 Muswell Hill, Muswell Hill, London, N10 3RE. 

### What information do we collect? How do we use it?

When you request a brochure, we need to know your name, address and email address. This allows us to process and fulfil your request. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your request. 

When you order, we need to know your name, address, email address, recipient name and delivery address. This allows us to process and fulfil your order and to notify you of the status of your order. 

We also ask for your telephone number, which enables us to contact you urgently if there is a problem with your order. 

When you book an experience, we need you know your name, address, email address, answers to any questions required by our experience partners, and a telephone number (preferably mobile) so that we can contact you if there are any last-minute changes to your experience. If you provide us with a mobile phone number, we will send you an SMS reminder the day before you are due to take part in your experience. 

Throughout each of these processes, when you login to or create an account, you are able to choose whether you wish to receive further information from us, the method by which you would like to receive it (email, post, telephone and/or SMS) and who you would like to receive it from (Red Letter Days and/or trusted third parties). 

### How does Red Letter Days protect customer information?

When you place orders or request a brochure, we use a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, as required by the UK Data Protection Legislation, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

Red Letter Days may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.
