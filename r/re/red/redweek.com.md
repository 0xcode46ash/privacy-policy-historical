# Privacy Policy

Version 3 (Posted August 15, 2012) 

We have created this privacy policy to demonstrate our commitment to the privacy of our users. The following discloses our information gathering and usage practices. 

  1. **Privacy of user information**

We do not sell, rent, or give away user information except in cases where you specifically request it. If you participate in the RedWeek Exchange Program, critical information required to process the deposit of your week and your exchange reservation will be shared with our partner company to complete the transaction. By depositing your week or reserving an exchange with RedWeek.com, you agree to allow RedWeek or our partner to communicate with the resort and/or management company to exchange necessary information. Your information will only be used to complete this transaction, and will otherwise be held private and confidential. 

Occasionally we may run promotions in partnership with resort developers where you will be given the option to receive more information. In this case, we will provide your contact information to the resort to follow through on your request. You will never be tricked into signing up for anything. Options to receive more information will always be clearly explained to you and your participation in any promotion is strictly optional. 

If you add a posting to RedWeek.com, your contact information will not be made public, unless you choose to enter additional contact information into the Details section. Otherwise, RedWeek.com members will contact you via the form on your posting page, which will deliver the correspondence to the e-mail address you have provided us with. Your e-mail address will not be exposed to the member who contacted you until you reply. If you send an inquiry through RedWeek.com, the person you contacted will have your e-mail address for further direct correspondence.
