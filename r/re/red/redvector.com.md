## **WHAT KIND OF SECURITY DOES VECTOR SOLUTIONS USE?**

The security of your personal data is very important to us. We use physical, electronic, and administrative safeguards designed to protect your personal data from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, use, alteration or disclosure. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of our Websites, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We urge you to take care when providing information in public areas of our Websites like message boards, which any website visitor can view.

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data transmitted to our Websites. Any transmission of personal data is at your own risk. We are not responsible for the circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on our Websites.

## **DOES VECTOR SOLUTIONS USE LINKS TO OTHER INTERNET WEBSITES?**

As part of our routine business operations, our Websites contain links to third party websites, plug-ins, services, social networks or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you. Vector Solutions does not control these third-party websites, and we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit, as its privacy policy may differ substantially from that of this Privacy Policy.

## **WHAT IS VECTOR SOLUTIONS’ CHILDREN’S ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY?**

With respect to minors, [www.VectorSolutions.com](http://www.vectorsolutions.com/) and any of our Websites are not intended to be accessed or utilized by persons under the age of 18. We do not specifically market to children under 13. Vector Solutions does not intend or purposefully attempt to gather information from children under the age of 13.

The following applies to Scenario Learning, LLC Clients only:

**FERPA      **

Scenario Learning, LLC and its Clients are subject to the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (“FERPA”). As such, Scenario Learning, LLC acknowledges that: (a) Scenario Learning, LLC and its Clients are each providing educational services to the other that they would otherwise have to provide for themselves using faculty and staff; (b) each  has a legitimate educational interest in the student education records that may be disclosed; and (c) Scenario Learning, LCC will be under the direct control of each Client User with respect to the use and maintenance of information from student education records. Scenario Learning, LLC acknowledges that the student education record it may receive is confidential and will use the information only for the purposes for which the disclosure was made. Scenario Learning, LLC  will not re-disclose the information to any third party without prior written consent from the student and client. Scenario Learning, LLC works together with its Clients to share student education records in a manner that protects such records from disclosure.

The following applies to Not Anymore Client and Client’s Users only:

**Limited Reporting          **

In addition to the security provided by the Client/Server technical design, Scenario Learning, LLC has a feature designed to prevent Not Anymore Client users from uniquely identifying the personal data from any individual user. For each Client (e.g., each school), an administrator is provided with access to an online portal that provides information about that Client’s User’s progress. The administrator has access to a Progress Report, which includes user-specific information as discussed above. Not Anymore Clients have access to a raw data report that includes all of the de-identified data. The de-identified data does not become available to the Client until at least 100 men and 100 women have completed the program. In addition, each time the full raw data report is opened the information is randomized. These protections ensure that a Client is not able to review the Users that have completed the program each day and try to match it up with data in the raw data report, thereby identifying the personal data from any individual User. Should a Not Anymore Client not meet the 100 men and 100 women minimum, they are not provided access to the raw data until after all Not Anymore Client Users have completed the program, and if the number of completions is still too low at that time, either the demographic data is removed from the raw data file altogether or with very small populations, the raw data is not provided at all.
