# Red Giant - Support - Buyers Guide - Privacy Policy

Red Giant collects both certain personal information and certain non-personal information.  Red Giant treats information collected from BulletProof  (referred to below) as non-personal information.  However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal information by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal information.  Similarly, to the extent non-personal information is combined with personal information, we treat the combined information as personal information for purposes of the Red Giant Privacy Policy.

Collection of personal information

 As a visitor to this Site, you can engage in many activities without providing any personal information. In connection with other activities, such as placing orders or downloading software, Red Giant Software may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Red Giant may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including postal code), e-mail address, telephone and facsimile numbers, and other personal information. When ordering products on the Site, you will be asked to provide a credit card number. Depending upon the activity, some of the information that we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.

 When you submit personal information to Red Giant through the Site, you understand and agree that this information may be transferred and stored across national boundaries.

 How your personal information is used

 Red Giant collects your information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select.  When you register a product, for example, the information is used to register your rights, if any, to technical support or other benefits that may be made available to registered users.  As another example, if you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and to contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Your personal information is also used to track customer preferences and keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other products and services of Red Giant as part of our newsletter service.

 Red Giant Software recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of information collected on the Site. Red Giant may communicate information to you regarding products, services, and special offers available from Red Giant Software or selected third parties.  Except in the particular circumstances described in this Privacy Policy, Red Giant Software will also not provide your name to other companies or organizations without your consent.

 There are other instances in which Red Giant may divulge your personal information, such as where required by law, regulation, or litigation. We may also disclose information about you if we determine that such disclosure should be made for reasons of national security, law enforcement, or other issues of public importance.

Collection of non-personal information 

The non-personal information that Red Giant collects consists of usage statistics and other analytics collected anonymously through our software applications and products.  For example, with respect to its product BulletProof™, Red Giant gathers anonymous statistics about how BulletProof™ is used through its “Usage Statistics” feature. Our purpose is to understand which parts of BulletProof are used most, and which parts aren’t working as expected. The statistics collection does not collect any personal information, or look at anything that isn’t BulletProof related. 

Usage Statistics collection happens in the background and doesn’t require you to do a thing. Without any extra effort, you are helping us to build BulletProof’s features and define what it will do in future versions — how awesome is that?   _Read full statement describing  BulletProof usage statistics collection._

International Users

Information you provide may be transferred or accessed by entities in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.   Red Giant abides by the “safe harbor” framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal information collected by organizations of the European Economic Area and Switzerland.  Learn more about the U.S. Department of Commerce Safe Harbor Program at http://export.gov/safeharbor/eu/eg_main_018476.asp.]
