We are committed to protecting and respecting your privacy. Whenever you provide personal information we will treat your information in accordance with this privacy policy, and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

  * name
  * email address
  * postal address
  * telephone number
  * debit or credit card details



When you visit our site, we also sometimes use cookies, and collect information about your visit. For more details, please see the 'Cookies' and 'How We Use Your Information' sections below.

### How we use your information

We use your information in a number of ways, such as:

  * processing a donation that you have made
  * processing an order from our online shop
  * dealing with entries into competitions

We will not contact you for marketing purposes unless you have given your consent. If you have consented to receive marketing, you may opt out at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link at the bottom of our emails, or by contacting us through this site.

If you have consented to receive marketing, we may occasionally contact you to ask if you would be prepared to help us with our market research, although participation is purely voluntary.

When you visit our site, we sometimes collect information that enables us to identify you and provide you with a more personalised service. We also aggregate statistics about our supporters to enable us to operate more effectively, but these statistics do not include information which can identify individuals. 

### Disclosure of information

We will keep your personal information confidential, and will not supply it to any third party without your consent, unless we are obliged or permitted by law to do so.

We sometimes use third parties to process your information on our behalf (for example, to process donations, send out mailings, or analyse data). However, we require them to keep your information secure and not to use it for their own business purposes.

Some of our service providers may be located outside Europe, such as the U.S. or Canada, and by providing personal information to us, you consent to your information being processed on our behalf in these countries.

By providing personal information to us, you consent that we may transfer your information within Comic Relief's group of companies, and that your personal information may be transferred to a third party in the event of a reorganisation or merger of Comic Relief.
