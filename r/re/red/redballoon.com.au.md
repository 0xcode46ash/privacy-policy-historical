Please read this Privacy Policy carefully to understand how any personal information collected by RedBalloon is used.

This website www.redballoon.com.au/ www.redballoon.co.nz (the **Site** ) is used by RedBalloon to give visitors and customers ( **Users** ) access to various products and services (the **Services** ).

Access to the Site and the provision of the Services is conditional on Users accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy applies to the collection, storage, use and dissemination by RedBalloon of the personal information of the individuals using the Site.

This Privacy Policy has been developed in accordance with the _Commonwealth Privacy Act 1988_.

**What we will do with a user’s personal information**

Personal information collected from users is used for the following purposes:

(a) process a booking and/or order (for example but not limited to sending order confirmation and booking confirmation details)

(b) enable RedBalloon to communicate effectively, e.g. respond to any questions, concerns, or problems raised by the User

(c) enhance functionality of the Site and Services when a User is logged in, e.g. but not limited to personalised recommendations and submission of customer feedback.

**What personal information we collect from you**

  * We request information from Users prior to their making a purchase or booking, for example contact information (like name, phone number, email address and delivery/ billing address). If there is an enquiry or trouble is experienced when processing an order or booking, this contact information is used to contact the User. This information will be saved for future orders and/ or bookings.
  * In order to facilitate purchases we also request financial information (like credit card number, expiration date). No credit card details are retained under any circumstances.
  * The User will also be given the option to sign up for our email newsletter. Once subscribed a User is given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of receiving emailed information or other correspondence, by simply clicking the unsubscribe button at the bottom of any newsletter email they receive from us.



**What we will not do with a user’s personal information**

RedBalloon will keep a user’s personal information confidential and not sell or knowingly divulge user information to advertisers or any other third parties other than our partner suppliers in order to supply their service e.g. Experience Providers and our customer feedback platform. Other than to partners, we will not share a user’s personal information, unless:

(a) we are required to share your information with a third party in order to comply with the law or to comply with a court order or subpoena;

(b) to enforce our Site rules;

(c) if it is necessary to provide it to our third party service providers, if any, such as data storage providers, who will be subject to strict contractual privacy obligations; or

(d) to protect the safety and security of our users and our Site.

**How we process a user’s personal information**

  * We ask for users’ consent to the use of any personal information we collect from them in accordance with this Privacy Policy at the time of providing that information. If a user does not wish to provide us with their consent, they cannot agree to the Site Terms and Conditions and must not use the Site.
  * Our use of the personal information we collect is necessary in order for us to maintain the Site and facilitate users’ use of the Site. We do not collect any unnecessary personal data from users (for instance, their race or religious beliefs).
