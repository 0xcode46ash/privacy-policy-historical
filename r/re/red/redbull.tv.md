Facebook directly transfers the Plugin content to Your browser, which embeds the latter into the Website, enabling Facebook to receive information about Your having accessed the respective page of Our Website. We have no influence on the data gathered by the Plugin and inform You according to Our state of knowledge.

If You are logged into Facebook, Your visit can be assigned to Your Facebook account.
