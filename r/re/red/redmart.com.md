# Security & Privacy Policy | RedMart

We at RedMart Pte. Ltd. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our”) know that our users (“you,” “your”) care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy very seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy. By visiting or using the redmart.com website and domain name, and any other linked pages, features, content, or any other services we offer from time to time in connection therewith (collectively, the "Website"), you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.

* #### WHAT DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY COVER?

This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that we gather when you are accessing or using our Website. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. Information you choose to disclose publicly on the Website (i.e., information which is viewable to other Website users) will not be considered Personal Information.

The Company does not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from anyone under the age of 13 or knowingly allow such persons to register. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Website or send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address. No one under age 13 may provide any personal information to the Company or on the Website. In the event that we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that we might have any information from or about a child under 13, please contact us at [help](mailto:help@redmart.com).

* #### WHAT INFORMATION DOES THE COMPANY COLLECT?

We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained more fully below. We may use this Personal Information to personalize and improve our services, to allow our users to set up a user account and profile, to contact users, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, to analyze how users utilize the Website, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy. We may share certain types of Personal Information with third parties (as set forth in this Section and in Section 3 below). We collect the following types of information:

  * **Information you provide to us:**

We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, during the registration process, we collect Personal Information such as your email address, name, address, telephone number, household makeup, ethnicity, nationality, birth date, IP address, browser information, and third-party account credentials (for example, your log-in credentials for Facebook or other third party sites). If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you are consenting to have the information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information is covered by this Privacy Policy. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.

  * **Information collected automatically:**

Whenever you interact with our Website, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, “cookie” information, and the pages you requested.

"Cookies" are identifiers we transfer to your computer through your browser that allow us to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser to prevent or limit your computer’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of our Website’s best features. Our Consumer Packaged Goods Manufacturer and Distributor Partners (“Partners”) may also transmit cookies to your computer, when you click on certain content that may appear on our site. This Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any Partners.

When we collect usage information (such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site), we only use this data in aggregate form, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. For example, this aggregate data tells us how often customers use parts of the Website, so that we can make the Website appealing to as many customers as possible. We may also provide this aggregate information to our Partners, so that they can understand how often people use their products or services and our Website, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. We never disclose aggregate information to a Partner in a manner that would identify you personally.

  * **Email and other communications:**

We may contact you, by email or other means; for example, we may send you promotional offers on behalf of our Partners, or communicate with you about your use of the Website. If you do not want to receive email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference through your account settings. Also, we may receive a confirmation when you open an email from us. This confirmation helps us make emails more interesting and improve our service.



* #### WILL COMPANY SHARE ANY OF THE INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?

We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information with third parties only as described below.

  * **Partners**

We may allow our Partners to choose the demographic information of users who will see their promotions and receive their communications. We may also provide information we have collected from you to a Partner in non-personally-identifiable form, in order for that Partner to select the appropriate audience for its promotions and communications.

  * **Affiliated Businesses and Third Party Websites we do not control**

In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell items or provide services to you through the Website (either alone or jointly with us). We may, for example, sell products or provide services jointly with affiliated businesses, or work with third party websites to enhance your online experience. You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to choose to automatically transmit information you input on the Website to your profile on a third party website. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to allow the automatic transmissions discussed above, please review all third party websites’ policies before engaging in such automatic transmissions on the Website.

  * **Agents**

We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For example, when you pay for a purchase on the Website, we would need to allow the payment processing company to verify the transaction; however, that company would only be authorized to use your credit card information to the extent we needed their assistance in completing your transaction.

  * **Business transfers**

We may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that is transferred. Also, if we (or substantially all of our assets) are acquired, or if we are reorganized or go through some other change of control, Personal Information would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party. We will try to give you advance notice if your Personal Information will be transferred to a third party in this manner, so that you can delete your account with us if you choose.

  * **Protection of the Company and others**

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of the Company, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

  * **With your consent**

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.



* #### IS PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT ME SECURE?

Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you place an order, or enter, submit, or access your personal information. While we endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.

The Website may contain links to other sites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices on other sites. When following a link to another site you should read that site’s privacy policy.

* #### WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION CAN I ACCESS?

Through your account settings, you may access and, in some cases, change certain information you’ve provided to us. The information you can view and update through your account may change as the Website changes. If you have any questions about viewing or updating information we have on file about you, please contact us at [help@redmart.com](mailto:help@redmart.com).

* #### WHAT CHOICES DO I HAVE?

Keep in mind that the information we gather is in an effort to offer you a superior online shopping experience that is customized.

You may be able to add or update certain information as explained in Section 5 above. When you update information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.

You may request deletion of your account by sending an email to [help@redmart.com](mailto:help@redmart.com). Please note that some information may remain in our private records after deletion of your account. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your personal information after you delete your account, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

If you do not wish to receive email or other mail from us, contact us at [help@redmart.com](mailto:help@redmart.com). Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Website, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.

* #### CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used. If we make changes in the way we use Personal Information, we will notify you by posting an announcement on our Website or sending you an email. You are bound by any changes to the Privacy Policy when you use the Website after such changes have been first posted.

* #### QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS

If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to [help@redmart.com](mailto:help@redmart.com). We will make every effort to resolve your concerns in a satisfactory manner.
