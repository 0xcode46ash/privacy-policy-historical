# Privacy Policy | Red Lion

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.redlion.net](http://www.redlion.net/). If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, please e-mail us at [webmaster@redlion.net](mailto:webmaster@redlion.net).

**We respect your privacy**  
At Red Lion Controls we value our customers and their privacy. All personal information is used to ensure efficient processing of your order. This information is used by our staff and authorized distributors for contacting and identifying customers and their needs. We will not give, sell, rent, or loan any personally identifiable information to any third party, unless we are legally required to do so or you authorize us to do so.

**No SPAMMING!**  
Unsolicited, "spam" mail is not sent to Red Lion Controls customers. The only email customers will receive, are updates to their recent orders and occasional promotions, **if requested.** Customers can be removed from our promotion list at anytime by visiting a link provided within the email.

**Your Personal Information is Secure**  
Red Lion Controls uses the industry standard security protocol Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encode sensitive information, such as your credit card number, that passes between you and [www.redlion.net](http://www.redlion.net/). We employ the latest 128-bit encryption technology in all areas of the site which require you to provide your personal or account information. This means that the credit card information you send is encrypted by your computer, and then decrypted again on our side, preventing others from accessing your private information in between.

If you have any questions regarding Red Lion Controls’ privacy/security pledge, please e-mail us at [webmaster@redlion.net](mailto:webmaster@redlion.net)

## More Privacy Terms...

Red Lion Controls has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: [www.redlion.net](http://www.redlion.net/). Any changes or updates to our privacy practices will be updated through our website.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses, browser type, and time of day, to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Registration**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (such as their name and email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor in the event of a problem when processing an order. For example, problems with credit card verification, product availability, etc. Users have a choice of receiving future mailings; during the registration process.

Our site uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. We collect visitor's contact information (such as their email address), and financial information (for example their account or credit card numbers). The customer's contact information is used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. i.e., in the event there is a problem processing an order, corporate changes, or changes in privacy practices. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services.

**3rd Parties**  
Red Lion Controls is the sole collector of information, and does not share with any 3rd parties without your specific consent.

**Security**  
This website takes every precaution to protect our users’ information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both on-line and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information on-line, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users’ information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment.

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

## Third-Party Plugins

**Facebook Social Plugins**  
The Red Lion website uses Social Plugins provided by the social network facebook.com, which is operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. The plugins can be recognized by the Facebook logo (white "f" on a blue tile or a "thumbs up" sign) or the notation "Facebook Social Plugin". The list and the look of Facebook Social Plugins can be viewed here: <http://developers.facebook.com/plugins>.

When you visit a website that contains a social plugin, your browser establishes a direct link to the Facebook servers. The content of the plugin is transferred by Facebook directly to your browser, which embeds the latter into the website. Red Lion Controls therefore has no influence over the scope of data that Facebook collects using the plugin and is thus informing you of what it knows.

By using the plugins, Facebook is informed that you have accessed the corresponding page of the offer. If you are logged into Facebook, Facebook can link your visit to your Facebook account. If you interact with the plugins, for example, or press the Like Button or post a comment, the corresponding information is transmitted directly from your browser to Facebook and stored there. If you are not a member of Facebook, it is still possible for Facebook to find out your IP address and store it. According to Facebook, only an anonymized IP address is stored in Germany.

Please refer to the Facebook data protection statement regarding the purpose and scope of data collection and the further processing and use of data by Facebook, and the respective rights and settings options for protecting your privacy at <http://www.facebook.com/policy.php>.

**Google Maps**  
The Red Lion website uses Google Maps on some pages to display interactive maps and to create directions. Google Maps is a map service from Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California 94043, USA. By using Google Maps, information about the use of this website can be transferred to Google in the USA, including your IP address and the (starting) address you entered in the route planner.

If you visit a web page of our website that includes Google Maps, your browser directly connects to Google servers. The map will be transmitted from Google directly to your browser and then integrated into the website. We have no influence of the scope of data collected by Google in this way.

They can be identified by terminology such as "Twitter" or "sequence", combined with a stylized blue bird. Using the buttons it is possible to contribute or to share this page on Twitter or to follow the provider on Twitter.

When you visit a website that contains this type of button, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Twitter servers. The content of the Twitter buttons is transmitted from Twitter directly to your browser. Red Lion Controls therefore has no influence over the scope of data that Twitter collects using the plugin and is thus informing you of what it knows. Accordingly, only the IP address of the user is transmitted with the URL of each website when the button is pressed, but not for purposes other than the appearance of the buttons.
