# Red Robin - Privacy Policy

Welcome to Red Robin Gourmet Burgers!  
PRIVACY POLICY

Effective as of 5/2/2007

Red Robin Gourmet Burgers, Inc. ("Red Robin") has adopted this Privacy Policy for itself and its subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information ("PII") we obtain from and about individuals located in the United States and Canada both online and off-line. 

REVISIONS TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY

From time to time Red Robin may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our websites, and technology. If we revise the way we collect or use your PII, we will prominently post those changes in this Privacy Policy. You should review our Privacy Policy periodically so that you keep up to date on our most current policies and practices. We will note the effective date of the latest version of our Privacy Policy at the beginning of the Privacy Policy.

COLLECTION: COLLECTION OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION ("PII") BY RED ROBIN

General. Red Robin collects personally identifiable information ("PII" -- that is, information such as your full name, e-mail address, mailing address or telephone number) in order to create or enhance our relationship with you. When we collect PII from you, it is because you voluntarily submitted the information to us in order to participate in activities, such as sweepstakes, contests, games, surveys, forums, subscription registrations, in connection with content or suggestions you submit to us, chats or bulletin boards, or because you want us to furnish you with products, services or information. We may also obtain PII from reputable third parties.

Cookies. "Cookies" are small bits of information that the Red Robin website places on the hard drive of your computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on the site and enable the operator of the website to make your visits to our website more enjoyable.

At this time, Red Robin does not use cookies. In the future, we may use cookies in a variety of ways, including storing your password for easy logon and relating your use of our site to your PII, so that, if you ask us to send you information about our upcoming products or promotions, those cookies and/or click stream data about your activities on Red Robin websites will allow us to limit the material we send you to the types of items you viewed on our site in the past. In the future, if we wish to coordinate your PII and website activity information in this manner, we will obtain your express affirmative consent before doing so.

Third party advertisements displayed on Red Robin’s sites may contain cookies set by Internet advertising companies or advertisers (See “Notice” below). Red Robin does not control those cookies, and visitors to Red Robin’s sites will need to check the privacy policy of the Internet advertising company or advertiser to see whether and how it uses cookies.

You can program your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent by a website to your computer’s hard drive or you can program your computer to refuse cookies completely.

NOTICE: RED ROBIN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH NOTICE ABOUT ITS PII COLLECTION PRACTICES

When you voluntarily provide PII to Red Robin, we will make sure you are informed about who is collecting the information, how and why the information is being collected and the types of uses we will make of the information. 

At the time you provide your PII, Red Robin will notify you of your options regarding our use of your PII, including whether we may share it with outside companies (See “Choice” below). This Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and that may want us to share your personal information with them, provided you have given Red Robin your affirmative consent to do so (See "Use" below). 

Sometimes we collect personally identifiable information from consumers in manual format or off-line, such as a post card or a paper eClub enrollment form. Providing detailed notice of this Privacy Policy in those situations often proves impractical, so in those situations, we may provide guests with a short notice that describes how to obtain from us the full text of this Policy and other relevant information.

Red Robin's websites may be linked to Internet sites operated by other companies. Some of those third party websites may be co-branded with a Red Robin logo, even though we do not operate or maintain those third party websites. Red Robin's website may also carry advertisements from other companies. Red Robin is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites operated by third parties that are linked to our websites. Neither are we responsible for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies. Once you've left the Red Robin website via such a link or by clicking on an advertisement, you will need to check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser on their website to determine how they will handle any PII they collect from you.

CHOICE: RED ROBIN WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII

Red Robin will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purposes we tell you about when you submit your PII. Unless we obtain your affirmative consent to do so, we will not share your PII with third parties with whom we do not have a contractual relationship requiring us to provide them your PII.

USE: RED ROBIN'S USE OF PII 

Red Robin will use your PII that you provide us under this Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Policy. If Red Robin obtains PII from a third party, our use of that information will be governed by this Policy. If Red Robin materially changes its use of PII under its Privacy Policy, your PII will continue to be governed by the Privacy Policy under which we collected your PII unless you consent to the change in Red Robin’s Privacy Policy.

Red Robin may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us (that is, companies that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with Red Robin) or that we use to process information you provide via our website. Provided you have given us your affirmative consent to our doing so, we may also share your PII with our franchisees and with parties who advertise their products and services on our website who are not affiliates of Red Robin but who would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, Red Robin may offer a sweepstakes or contest in conjunction with a co-sponsor that may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to Red Robin guests. However, when we collect PII from you, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties who are not our affiliates or companies with whom we have contracted to process information we receive via our website. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those third parties that Red Robin uses to perform tasks required to complete purchases you make through Red Robin’s website, such as fulfilling orders and processing payments for us.

We allow Red Robin's team members, agents and contractors to access your PII only when they have a legitimate business reason for doing so. Red Robin may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (e.g., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses), but they may use your PII only to provide Red Robin with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

There may be instances when Red Robin may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Red Robin, other affiliated companies or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our website; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Red Robin sells all or part of its business or sells or transfers a significant part of its assets to another party or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Red Robin may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

SECURITY: RED ROBIN PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII

Red Robin uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in Red Robin’s possession and control against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Red Robin uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete.

USA PATRIOT ACT: GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION

Red Robin and its subsidiaries are located in the United States. We use vendors located in the United States to process and store personally identifiable information that we gather through our Web site. Your PII may be processed and stored in the United States. United States governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the USA Patriot Act and other laws of the United States. If you provide us your PII, then you acknowledge and agree that we have notified you of the risk that the United States government, courts or law enforcement agencies or regulatory agencies may be able to obtain disclosure of your information through the laws of the United States, and you nonetheless consent to our collection, use and disclosure of you personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.

ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR PII

Red Robin has implemented a procedure that you may use to access, correct or delete your PII, and, if you are a registered user of Red Robin’s website, to review your user preferences.

After reviewing the relevant databases, we will confirm whether we have collected such information about you and provide a list of your PII that we have on file.

Fiddler’s Green Circle, Suite 200 North, Greenwood Village, CO 80111, Attn: Privacy Officer, requesting that we permanently remove your PII from any Red Robin database.
