# RedditGifts Privacy Policy

The following Privacy Policy summarizes the various ways that redditgifts.com ("Service Provider", "we" or "our") treats the information you provide while using www.redditgifts.com ("Website"). It is our goal to provide a gift exchange service for matching gift-giver to recipient while protecting your privacy. 

Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. You can access the Privacy Policy any time at http://redditgifts.com/privacy/. Your use of and/or registration on any aspect of the Website will constitute your agreement to this Privacy Policy. If you cannot agree with the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Website.

In addition to reviewing this Privacy Policy, please read our Terms of Service. Your use of the Website constitutes agreement to its terms and conditions as well. 

### The Type of Information the Website Collects

The Website only collects personally identifying information with your specific knowledge and consent. As this purpose of this website is an online, "Secret-Santa"-style gift exchange ("Gift Exchange"), we will only ask for information relevant to this activity. This includes, but is not limited to, your Reddit.com username, real name, physical mailing address, gender, interests, etc.

Our servers may also automatically collect information about your computer when you visit the Website, including without limitation the type of browser software you use, the operating system you are running, the website that referred you, and your Internet Protocol ("IP") address. Your IP address is usually associated with the place from which you enter the Internet, like your Internet Service Provider, your company or your university. 

### How the Website Uses Information Provided by You

Service Provider uses your user name and password to grant you access to and use of the Website. Your e-mail address will be used, at your request, to send you a copy of your user name and password. If you provide personally identifiable information, it will be used to provide you with the service you have requested. Your email address will be used to communicate updates on the status of the Gift Exchange, and will not be used for any other purposes. 

We may also provide access to our database in order to cooperate with official investigations or legal proceedings, including, for example, in response to subpoenas, search warrants, court orders, or other legal process.

In addition, we reserve the right to use the information we collect about your computer, which may at times be able to identify you, for any lawful business purpose, including without limitation to help diagnose problems with our servers, to gather broad demographic information, and to otherwise administer our Website. 

In addition to your personally identifying information being protected as outlined above, under no circumstances will we sell or give your personally identifiable information to any third party. This does not include anonymous usage statistics.

### Cookies

You may have read about "cookies," nuggets of information that are placed by a Website in a storage place on your own computer. We may use cookies to record registration and personalization information. For example, if you register on any part of the Website and are given the option to save your user name and password on your computer, we can provide this convenience to you by placing a cookie on your computer. 

If you don't want any cookies, your Web browser likely includes an option that allows you to not accept them. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, some portions of the Website may not function properly. 

### Information Security and Notification

Because no data transmission over the Internet is completely secure, and no system of physical or electronic security is impenetrable, Service Provider can not guarantee the security of the information you send to us or the security of our servers or databases, and by using the Website you agree to assume all risk in connection with the information sent to us or collected by us when you use the Website. In the unlikely event that we believe that the security of your information in our possession or control may have been compromised, we may seek to notify you. If notification is appropriate, we may notify you by e-mail (provided we have your e-mail address). 

### Minors

This website does not have a specific privacy policy in place for minors, as users under the age of 18 are not permitted.

### Privacy Policy Coordinator

If you have any concerns or questions about any aspect of this policy, please feel free to contact our Privacy Policy Coordinator at support@redditgifts.com
