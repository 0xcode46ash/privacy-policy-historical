# RedBrick Health – Privacy Policy

5\.  What Information Do We Collect About You?

We collect, create and use Personal Information and Protected Health Information about you, as well as Non-Personal Information.

Personal Information includes information that can specifically identify you as well as information about you that may be combined with identifying information. For example, Personal Information includes:

**Protected Health Information**

Protected Health Information is a special category of Personal Information defined and protected by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), a federal law within the United States. Protected Health Information includes individually identifiable information, like your name, combined with medical or health-insurance-related information that is collected or maintained on behalf of your health insurance provider or your medical provider.

**Non-Personal Information**

Non-Personal Information is information we create or collect about your visit to our website that is not specific to you or does not identify you. For example, Non-Personal Information includes:

  * Number of visitors to the website
  * The websites from which visitors came to our website
  * The pages visited while on our website
  * The length of visits to our website
  * The names of Internet providers
  * Internet Protocol (IP) addresses
  * Browser information

6\.  How Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Devices?

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it. This information may include Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/ time stamp, and/or clickstream data.

RedBrick and our Partners, affiliates, and analytics or service providers use technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts, to analyze trends, administer the website, track movement around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We receive reports on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual and aggregated basis.

We use cookies to remember your settings, such as your language preference, and for authentication. You can control the use of cookies with your browser settings. If you reject cookies, you may not be able to log in to our website or use its features.

Some of our partners may provide certain features on our website based upon your web-browsing activity and use HTML5 to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5.

7\.  Can You Use Do-Not-Track?

Our website and web portal are not configured to respond to do-not-track settings in your browser.

8\.  What Information Do We Keep?

We retain your information as needed to provide our Services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.

9\.  Where Do We Keep Your Information?  
We store your information in the United States in one of our data centers.

10\. Do We Share Information We Have About You?

Yes. We share information we have about you in order to provide you with our Services. We share your Personal Information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We will only share your Personal Information with entities that have a legal right to access it and that are obligated to protect it in similar ways that we are obligated to protect it. We may further limit the way we share your Personal Information based on the direction of your Sponsor and any privacy policy that they may ask us to adhere to.

**Your Access to Your Personal Information**

You may access your own Personal Information and information about your participation in our Services through our secure, password-protected web portal.

**Sharing Information with Healthcare Providers**

We may share your Personal Information with your healthcare providers and any clinics or organized healthcare organizations with whom they are associated, such as an Accountable Care Organization (ACO).

**Sharing Information with Other Participants**

Your Sponsor may arrange for us to create a wellness-based contest between you and other participants. If you choose to participate in those contests, we may share limited information about you with other participants. The type of information will be limited to information that is relevant for the contest. For example, in a contest based on the number of steps taken, other participants may see your name, that you have registered to participate in the contest, and that you have taken a certain number of steps. In these situations, your Personal Information will not be available unless you choose to register for the contest.

**Sharing Information with Our Business Partners**

We enter into agreements with our business partners to assist us in providing you with our Services. These business partners are authorized to use your Personal Information only as necessary to provide these Services. We require these business partners to protect your Personal Information and to comply with applicable laws or regulations.

**Sharing Information with Sponsors**

Under U.S. laws, we may share Protected Health Information with plan sponsors for plan administration purposes and coordination of your care.

**Sharing Information with Your Employer**

We will not share your individually identifiable Protected Health Information with your employer for employment- related purposes. Your employer will only have access to the information needed to plan and deliver health programs.

**Sharing Information for Marketing Purposes**

We do not sell and will not give your Personal Information to any other entity for any marketing purpose. We may use your Personal Information to communicate with you about our Services that are available to you as a benefit under your health plan.

**Sharing Information to Meet Legal Requirements**

We will not share Personal Information with a third party without prior authorization, except (i) in compliance with law, regulation or other legal processes, (ii) to protect the rights, property or safety of us or others, (iii) in emergency situations, and (iv) in the event that we or substantially all of our assets are acquired by one or more third parties as a result of an acquisition, merger, sale, reorganization, consolidation or liquidation, in which case Personal Information may be one of the transferred assets.

11\. Do You Have Choices Related to Your Personal Information?

You have the ability to “opt out” of communications from us or our partners if you wish, but this will limit our ability to support you when or if you have questions. It will also limit our ability to provide you with important updates from us, and potentially your Sponsor, about changes or deadlines in your programs.

If you would prefer not to receive any communications from RedBrick Health, please call your designated 800 number and let the support specialist know you would like to opt out of communications.

You may have additional rights with respect to Protected Health Information as may be explained in your Sponsor’s Notice of Privacy Practices. Contact your Sponsor for a copy of that Notice.

12\. Can You Correct Errors with Your Personal Information?

You may review your Personal Information on our web portal. If you notice any errors, you may contact us at the phone number, email address or mailing address below, and request that we correct your Personal Information. If we determine that the information is inaccurate and we are the source of the error, we will try to correct the information. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time frame. Because we collect information about you from a variety of sources, we may ask you to contact the source of the information to correct the information. For example, we may not be able to correct information received from a Sync Partner or as part of a laboratory test result.

13\. Links to Other Websites

We may include links to other websites on our website. We do not endorse and are not responsible for the information practices or privacy policies of these websites operated by others that may be linked to or from our website. If you decide to access a third party’s website that may be linked to or from our website, you should consult that website’s Privacy Policy and Terms of Use documents.

14\. Social Media

Our website includes Social Media features, such as the option to share on Facebook or Twitter. These features may collect your Internet protocol address, or which page you are visiting on our website, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

15.Blogs

Our website offers publicly accessible blogs or community forums. If you choose to participate in these blogs or community forums, be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them.

Contact us to request removal of your Personal Information from our blog. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your Personal Information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so.

16\. Data Security

We deliver our Services over the Internet, and no transaction over the Internet can be totally secure. We do, however, implement industry standard security measures, including physical, administrative and technical safeguards. We protect your Personal Information transmitted over the Internet using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We also restrict access to your Personal Information to our authorized employees, our agents and certain authorized partners responsible for providing our Services.

17\. Children’s Privacy

The website is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect any Personal Information from persons under the age of 13.
