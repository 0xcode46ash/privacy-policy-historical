In the event of questions about: (i) access to Personal Information;  (ii) the collection, use, management or disclosure of Personal Information by or on behalf of the CRCS; or (iii) this Policy, individuals should contact the General Manager of the CRCS Zone in which they are ordinarily resident, or the CRCS Privacy Officer at the National Office in Ottawa.  A list of Zones and contact information is available at [http://www.redcross.ca/](http://www.redcross.ca/main.asp?id=000136 "Canadian Red Cross").

####  2\. The Collection, Use & Disclosure of Personal Information

For the purposes of this Policy:

_“Client” means an individual who has requested or used the services of the CRCS or who has applied for or registered in a CRCS training program or course, but does not include employees, volunteers, students and contractors of the CRCS or any Donor in any such other capacity;_

_“CRCS” also referred to as “we” or “us” includes the Canadian Red Cross Community Health Services;_

_“Donor” means any person who makes, or who indicates to the CRCS an intention to make a donation to the CRCS;_

_"Personal Information" means any information, recorded in any form, about an identified individual, or an individual whose identity may be inferred or determined from such information, but not including any business contact information._

The CRCS uses the verbal or written Personal Information provided by Clients, Donors and others in order to conduct assistance and training, activities, and outreach with the goal of assisting those in need in Canada and abroad. Our initiatives include providing and assisting in the provision of:

  * health and personal care services and programs;
  * disaster relief and preparedness services and programs;
  * violence, abuse, neglect and injury prevention services and programs;
  * tracing and reunion services;
  * first aid services and programs
  * water safety services and programs;
  * training and awareness courses or programs in connection with any of the above



As well as:

  * conducting and facilitating fundraising and appeals;
  * managing our relationship with Clients;
  * managing our relationship with Donors;
  * meeting any legal or regulatory requirement relating to the above or to the activities of the CRCS
  * other purposes consistent with the above.



Our use of Personal Information is limited to those purposes.  

Personal Information will be collected, to the extent possible, directly from the individual concerned. 

Personal Information provided by Clients may be shared, as may be required to carry out the above purposes, between personnel of the CRCS and with the International Committee of the Red Cross and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.   

Personal Information may also be disclosed to third parties, from time to time, to assist the CRCS with the administration and management of services and donations, and to facilitate fundraising.

To help keep our costs as low as possible, we may exchange donor names and personal contact information with other reputable humanitarian, charitable and not-for-profit organizations for the purpose of fundraising. We will take reasonable measures to allow individuals to refuse consent or to limit their consent to sharing this information.

Where a Client or Donor does not wish to have his or her name and personal contact information disclosed to other organizations as provided in this Policy, or where a Client does not wish to receive information on other services, he or she may so inform the CRCS.  Notice must be in writing to the CRCS, either to the program under which such Personal Information is being collected or to the General Manager of the CRCS Zone in which the person is ordinarily resident, or to the CRCS Privacy Officer at the National Office in Ottawa.

Where the Personal Information is health information the Client’s written consent will be obtained before the information is disclosed to third parties, except as otherwise specified in this Policy or by law.

The CRCS may disclose Personal Information of Clients and Donors to organizations or individuals that perform services on behalf of the CRCS.  Using contractual or other arrangements, we will ensure that agents, contractors and other third parties who receive Personal Information in the course of providing services act in a manner consistent with this Policy, and also agree to use such information solely for the purpose of providing services to the CRCS or on its behalf, in a consistent manner with our instructions.

Please note that there are circumstances where the use and/or disclosure of Personal Information may be justified or permitted, or where we are obliged to disclose information _without_ consent.  Such circumstances may include:

  * where required by law or by order or requirement of a court, administrative agency or other governmental tribunal;
  * where we believe, upon reasonable grounds, that it is necessary to protect the rights, privacy, safety or property of an identifiable person or group;
  * where it is necessary to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit any damages that we may sustain; or
  * where the information being disclosed or used is in the public domain.



In situations where we are obliged or permitted to disclose information without consent, we will not disclose more information than is required in the applicable circumstances.

####  3\. Consent

The CRCS considers that where a person provides Personal Information to the CRCS the person consents to our collection, use and disclosure of that Personal Information in accordance with this Policy.  We may seek additional specific authorizations or consents from time to time where required by law or in situations where we consider these to be necessary or appropriate, for example with respect to health information.

Subject to applicable legal or contractual restrictions to which an individual may be subject, an individual is free to refuse or withdraw his or her consent to the collection, use or disclosure of his or her Personal Information at any time upon reasonable notice in writing to the CRCS. It should be noted that in some circumstances the CRCS can only provide certain services if Personal Information is made available.
