# Web Privacy Policy- Canadian Red Cross

The Canadian Red Cross is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others.  The Canadian Red Cross collects information from users at several different points on its Web site.  We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.  IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

For both anonymous visitors and known visitors to our website, we collect information such as the server your computer is logged onto, the domain name of your internet service provider, your browser type and version (for example, Netscape or Internet Explorer) and your IP address. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer automatically and required for using the Internet. We may also derive the general geographic area associated with an IP address. We use “cookies”, sometimes in combination with “web beacons” or similar technology to collect information about how this website is used such as average time spent on this website, pages viewed, and information searched for, access times, response rates to online or e-mail advertising and other relevant information about your online experience. If you are an anonymous visitor, the information in this paragraph does not personally identify you but rather numerically identifies your computer’s browser. In addition, we place a cookie on your computer that identifies your visit to our site and we share this cookies’ information with a third party marketing provider that will use it to deliver marketing about us to you while you visit other sites on the internet. Our third party provider is located in the United States. If you do not want to receive cookies on your computer, you can select the appropriate settings in your browser’s options; however, doing so may limit some of the interactivity our site offers you.

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the Canadian Red Cross is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy policy of every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies solely to information collected by this Web site. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will update this page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

### Security and Confidentiality

All online transactions and contributions on this site occur through a safe, private, and secure system that protects the donor's personal information. From time to time we may communicate with donors via email. If a donor does not wish further communication, he/she is given an opportunity to opt out.

If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. They will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
