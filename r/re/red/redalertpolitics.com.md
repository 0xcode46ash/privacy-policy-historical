**INFORMATION COLLECTED ON OUR SITE**  
We or our third party service providers may collect and track the following types of information about users on our Site:

Optional Voluntary Information. In order to access or use certain services and capabilities on our Site, you may be required to voluntarily submit certain PII. The use of these services or capabilities is purely optional, so you are not required to submit any PII to Clarity Media Group if you do not wish to use them. Some of these capabilities include registering to receive newsletters or contribute content to the Site; e-mailing or otherwise sharing articles with others through our Site; participating in surveys, contests, or sweepstakes; or submitting feedback to us.

Usage tracking. Clarity Media Group tracks user traffic patterns and content accessed throughout our Site. However, we do not correlate this information with data about individual users. Clarity Media Group sometimes tracks and catalogs the search terms users of our Site enter in our Search function, but this tracking is not associated with individual users. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers’ needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand our audience.

Cookies. In order to improve your experience when using our Site, we, our third party service providers, or advertisers may place a text file called a “cookie” in the browser files of your computer, which may store preferences or other information, and may be used to help personalize your experience. The cookie itself does not contain Personal Information although it will enable us to relate your use of this Site to information that you have specifically and knowingly provided. A cookie can’t read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. We, our third party service providers or advertiser may also use “web beacons” or other technologies to monitor behavior and collect certain data regarding the actions of our users online, or “pixel tags,” which are small pieces of code embedded in emails sent to users.

We generally use third party advertising companies to serve ads when users visit the Site. In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. These companies may use Non-PII collected regarding user visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to our users. This Privacy Policy does not cover the collection methods or use of the information collected by these third parties. These third parties have their own privacy policies and may be members of The Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”), a cooperative group of ad serving providers that has developed a set of privacy principles to which its members adhere. To remove yourself from some or all NAI member advertising programs, please visit the NAI Opt Out Page and follow the relevant instructions. Please note that if you use a different computer or Internet browser, you may need to renew your opt-out choices.  
Our Site uses cookies to track user traffic patterns, to enhance your experience when using our Site, to persist information through your session, and to personalize the Site for you based on your preferences and selections. You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. If you’ve set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

Information Sent to Us by Your Web Browser. We may collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser, such as your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our Site, information on your operating system and browser, and the date and time of your visit. Such information does not by itself identify you personally. However, if you have registered on the Site, it may be possible for us to link the information provided by your browser to information that identifies you personally. In addition, we may review our server logs for security purposes, such as detecting intrusions into our network. If we suspect criminal activity, we might share our server logs — which contain visitors’ IP addresses — with the appropriate investigative authorities who could use that information to trace and identify individuals.

**USE OF INFORMATION COLLECTED ON THE SITE**  
Clarity Media Group may use PII collected on our Site:  
• to enhance your experience using our Site (whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the Site or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users),  
• to provide information you have requested,  
• to maintain your registration on the Site,  
• to process orders on our Site,  
• in connection with various programs, promotions or contests in which you participate,

• to improve our Site, for purposes related to the business of Clarity Media Group,  
• for any other purpose described in this Privacy Policy or any other agreement you may enter with Clarity Media Group, or otherwise as we may disclose to you from time to time.

We may also use Non-PII sent to us by your web browser or by cookies to perform statistical analyses of our server logs in order to study the use and popularity of various areas of our Site. We also review IP addresses to analyze where we are getting our audience.

Clarity Media Group creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. We will not collect (nor provide to an advertiser or sponsor) information that a specific identifiable user clicked on any particular ad. However, by clicking on, otherwise interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad, and this may lead to similar ads being targeted to you on our Site and potentially on other Sites.

**SHARING OF THE INFORMATION**  
We may inform advertisers of the results of our analyses of our server logs, including details regarding Site usage and general information about our audience, however, such disclosures will refer only to general, aggregate usage data from these analyses – never specific identifying information. We may share your PII with: (i) our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, parent company, or other related entities; (ii) companies and organizations that perform services on our behalf, for example, companies that provide support services to us (such as data storage and web hosting services); and (iii) carefully selected third parties for marketing or other purposes not expressly described herein. We may also disclose the PII we collect through our Site when we, in good faith, believe disclosure is appropriate to comply with the law (or a court order or subpoena); to prevent or investigate a possible crime, such as fraud or identity theft; to enforce the terms of use or other agreements that govern your use of our Site; to protect the rights, property or safety of RedAlertPolitics.com or Clarity Media Group, our users or others; or to protect your vital interests. Information submitted to our Site is an asset of Clarity Media Group and will become part of our normal business records. Your PII may be transferred to another company that has acquired the stock or assets of RedAlertPolitics.com, for example, as the result of a sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or liquidation. If such a transfer occurs, the acquiring company’s use of your PII will still be subject to this Privacy Policy, and the privacy preferences you have expressed to us.

Please be aware that although we may request your consent for some disclosures described in this section, by using our Site you are deemed to have accepted and agreed to the sharing of your information collected through our Site in the manner described in this Privacy Policy, and we will not be required to obtain your consent for any disclosure described in this Privacy Policy.

If you choose to participate by registering with the Site and create a profile as a user of our Site, choose to participate as a content contributor to our Site, or choose to post comments on our Site, please be aware that your profile, content contributor bio (if applicable) and any information you post on our Site (within your profile, comments, or otherwise), will automatically be visible to the general public, will potentially remain on the Site indefinitely, and may potentially be distributed with our content to other sites via RSS feeds or otherwise.

**THIRD PARTY SITES**  
Third party sites, partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our Site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices.
