## Our Policy

The American Red Cross uses its best efforts to respect and protect the privacy of our online visitors and donors. We will not share your e-mail address with third parties.

## Is Credit Card Information Secure?

We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols.

## Is My Personal Information Secure?

Yes. The same high grade encryption and https security protocols used for financial transactions on our site are used in collecting personal information.
