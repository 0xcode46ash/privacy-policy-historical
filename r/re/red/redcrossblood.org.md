  * Privacy Policy 



The American Red Cross respects the privacy of every visitor to our website. Your privacy is a priority, and we go to great lengths to protect it. This Internet Site Privacy Policy explains our online information practices. This Policy may be changed or updated from time to time. By visiting the Red Cross at [www.redcross.org](http://www.redcross.org/), you accept the practices described in this Policy.

Through our website, we offer convenient online access to our services and communicate with you about important opportunities and events. We will not collect personal information from you when you visit our website unless you provide the information to us voluntarily and knowingly.

  *   * **Registering for a class or special event:** When you register online for a class or special event, we may ask for your name and contact information. Depending upon the activity, we may also collect payment information (such as standard credit card data) and date of birth.
  *  **Applying to work at the American Red Cross as a volunteer or employee:** When you apply online to be a Red Cross volunteer, we will ask you for your name, contact information and date of birth. We may ask for other data as well, depending on the volunteer activity. When you apply to be a Red Cross employee, we ask for a variety of types of data that are typical for employment applications, and we may ask for your résumé.
  *  **Making an appointment to donate blood:** When you make an online appointment to donate blood, we will ask for your name, contact information, date of birth and blood type.
  *  **Making a financial contribution:** When you make a financial contribution online, we collect your name, contact information and standard credit card data.



We use “cookies” and other technologies to enhance your online experience. A “cookie” can be either permanent (i.e., it remains on your computer until you delete it) or temporary (i.e., it lasts only until you close your browser). A “cookie” is a small text file that helps us recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that can lead to website improvements. Cookies may also help us customize certain content on the website. Cookies and other similar technologies collect non-personal information about the user of a particular Internet Protocol (IP) address. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you can deny or accept the cookie feature using a simple procedure available in most browsers. If you block cookies, however, you may lose some website functionality. 

We use a variety of safeguards to protect the security of your credit card transactions. We use technologies and processes such as encryption, access controls, network firewalls, physical security and other measures. These measures make it extremely difficult for anyone to intercept the credit card information you send to us. When we work with other companies to process credit card transactions, those companies also use encryption and other security measures.

You can make financial contributions online, by mail, by calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767), or by contacting [your local Red Cross](https://web.archive.org/find-your-local-chapter) chapter.

We use the same security measures and industry-standard security protocols for online scheduling of blood donations as we do for credit card transactions. 

You can also schedule a blood donation by calling 1-800-RED CROSS (1-800-733-2767) or contacting your local Red Cross Blood Services Region.

The American Red Cross will not sell, trade, or share personal information about our financial donors with anyone else, nor will we send mailings to our financial donors on behalf of other organizations, unless a donor has given us specific permission to do so.

If you provide the Red Cross with personal information when you visit our website, we may use the information in our programs and activities. We may enter your name into one of our databases so we can contact you to obtain your input, provide information about our programs and events, or request contributions.

On occasion, the Red Cross may share information about you with vendors and service providers that assist us with our activities and programs. These vendors and service providers help us with functions such as fulfilling orders, managing data and processing donations. In addition, we make disclosures as required by law.

The American Red Cross is committed to accuracy and precision in processing your contribution information. We employ a variety of error-checking procedures, and our systems are subject to independent external and internal audits to ensure the privacy, security and accurate processing of your information.

If you need to contact us to review your information or make corrections, please use [this form.](https://web.archive.org/contact-us/general-inquiry)

The American Red Cross welcomes children to learn more about our organization and, where appropriate, find opportunities to serve their communities through Red Cross training programs and volunteer activities. However, we encourage children to do this only with their parents’ knowledge and supervision. For this reason, the Red Cross follows the guidelines for interactive electronic media published by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau.

To let us know your preferences about how we contact you, or to "opt-out" of receiving phone calls, e-mails or letters from the American Red Cross, go to the following links:
