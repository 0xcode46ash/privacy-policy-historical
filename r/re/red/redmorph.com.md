# RedMorph | Privacy Policy

## What we do and do not collect:

### A. What we do not collect

We do not collect personal information about you or your online activities. Our browser extensions, proxy servers, virtual private network (“VPN”) servers, and mobile apps do not collect any of your personally identifiable information. We have configured these devices so that they never log any records or websites accessed by an account. We do not use cookies, other than session cookies necessary for website login functionality, which expire when you close the browser. Further, we do not allow third parties to collect information about you on our Site or when you use the Service. Lastly, except for information that allows us to ensure your membership is up to date (only if you are a paid member), we do not collect any financial information from you. For paid members, any financial information that you provide to make payments is done directly through, collected by, and stored by our third party payment processors (currently PayPal). The use and storage of that information is governed by their applicable terms of service and privacy policy. This means RedMorph never stores or possesses your credit/debit card numbers, or other payment means.

###  B. What we do collect 

If you choose to become a RedMorph member, the only information that we collect is a username that you create, the email address that you provide, and the limited payment history linked to the username/email/password (collectively, this is called your “Panel Information” and is visible to you at any time through the User Portal). If you wish to remain anonymous, you can do so. This information is retained for up to 90 days after the membership is canceled. If we need to contact you regarding the Site, the Service, or your account, your email may be used to contact you. If you send us an e-mail, we will retain it and any response we make in order to handle any follow-up questions you may have, and to measure how effectively we address your concerns. We retain this limited information only for as long as is necessary depending on the reason for your submission. In addition, we keep the default user-agent sent by your web browser and IP address history for the past 90 days. This is to ensure that your username and password have not been compromised and to prevent malicious activity. If we detect that you are accessing the Member Portal from a different device or location, you may be required to go through our additional authentication process to ensure it’s really you. 

There are opportunities where you may elect to provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, physical address, or other personally identifiable information about yourself. You can do so through the forums or blogs that are offered through the Site from time to time. It is always up to you to determine whether you provide any information that can personally identify you. None of this information is required to access the Site or use the Services. Any information you transmit online in such blogs or forums will be made public once you post it and we cannot control (nor are we responsible for) the use any third party may make of such information. You should understand that any information that you submit on any public forum or blog through the Site is not and cannot be treated as confidential by us, and is not subject to this Privacy Policy. Your participation on these blogs and forums is voluntary, and you consent to full public disclosure of any personally identifiable information that you submit through such venues.

### D. Non-Personally Identifiable Information

In order to help ensure our proxy and VPN services are functioning properly, we look at aggregate traffic information at all our server locations. This does not have any personally identifiable information about you or any member. Additionally, when a member reports a suspect website on the SpyderWebTM inside our browser controller, only the IP address of the suspect website and the URL they are linked to is transmitted to RedMorph. We do not track or store the sender’s information.

### E. Cookies

We only use session cookies when you visit the Site. A cookie is a small, unique text file that a website can send to your computer hard drive when you visit a website. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Cookies allow us to provide visitors to our Site with certain conveniences, such as remembering your login details and hence delivering content specific to your membership.

## What we share:

Occasionally we may work with consultants, contractors, and auditors to help us with overall improvement on several fronts. As such we may share your Panel Information and other non-personally identifiable information with these parties in limited circumstances, and from time to time, we may share this information to assist us in providing operational or research activities on our behalf. There are a few, rare circumstances when we may have to share some or all of your Panel Information either to obey the law or protect our rights. We may share this information only to comply with laws or legally enforceable requests, to uphold our own rights with members or third parties, or to prevent harm to others and their property in an emergency situation. In all instances, we will only share the minimum information necessary to meet the immediate need.

## How We Protect Your Information

RedMorph maintains reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of any information that you disclose to us. However, due to the nature of the internet and computer systems, no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure, regardless of our best intentions. As such, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us.

## Business Transitions:

In the event we go through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, bankruptcy, or selling a portion of our assets, your Panel Information may be part of the assets transferred.

## How long we keep your information:

We may retain your information for no longer than 90 days after you cancel your subscription or longer if required by law.

## Limitation of Liability:

YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE OVER PRIVACY IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS PRIVACY POLICY AND REDMORPH’S TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING ANY INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATIONS ON DAMAGES CONTAINED THEREIN).

## General:

### A. Privacy Policy Changes

Our Privacy Policy is intended to provide you with a safe and secure experience. We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of our Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice and at our sole discretion. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on the Site and other places we deem appropriate. All Privacy Policy changes are effective immediately upon posting. The last date on which this Privacy Policy has been updated is noted above.

### B. Child Privacy

We want to let you know that it currently is our policy not to knowingly collect personal information on any person under age 13. If this policy ever changes, we will revise this Policy and will comply with the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, which include providing notice and choice to each child's parent or guardian before collecting personal information.  
If you are under 18, you may purchase our Services at our Site only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
