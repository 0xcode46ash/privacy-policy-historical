**Our Policy**  
The American Red Cross uses its best efforts to respect the privacy of its online visitors. At our site, we do not collect personally identifiable information from individuals unless they provide it to us voluntarily and knowingly. This means we do not require you to register or provide information to us in order to view our site. The American Red Cross only gathers personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, zip/postal codes, e- mail addresses, etc., when voluntarily submitted by a visitor. For example, personally identifiable information may be collected in order to respond to a stated desire to volunteer time to the American Red Cross, to schedule a blood donation or to make a financial donation online. This information is used solely by the American Red Cross or other entities who are involved in the operation of this site for internal purposes. American Red Cross lists are never sold to third parties. We will only share personally identifiable information with third parties when (i) the person submitting the information authorizes us to share it; (ii) sharing the information is a necessary operation of the site, for instance, to process a credit card transaction, or (iii) we are required to by law. The American Red Cross has no control over or responsibility for the data collection and use practices of third parties that process online donation credit card transactions. 

**Is Credit Card Information Secure?**  
We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Contributions may also be made by calling 1-800-HELP NOW or directly to your [local chapter](http://www.redcross.org/where/where.html). 

**Is My Personal Information Secure?**  
Yes. The same high grade encryption and https security protocols used for financial transactions on our site are used in collecting personal information to schedule your blood donation. Blood donations may also be scheduled by calling 1-800-GIVE-LIFE or your local American Red Cross Blood Services Region. 

**We Care About Doing It Right**  
In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information you share with us, the American Red Cross works to accurately process your contribution information. During business hours, staff are available to answer questions about your financial donation or scheduled blood donation at [info@usa.redcross.org](mailto:info@usa.redcross.org). You may also send us a message at [internet@usa.redcross.org](mailto:internet@usa.redcross.org). 

The American Red Cross employs error checking procedures to make certain transactions are processed completely and accurately. As necessary, changes are made to improve our systems. And, independent external and internal audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site. 

**How Do We Use "Cookies"?**  
Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the American Red Cross’ Website through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Website can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor’s ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor’s system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. The American Red Cross uses "cookie" technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors’ online experience and facilitate their visit within our site. 

**Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy**  
The American Red Cross welcomes children to learn more about our organization and, where appropriate, find opportunities to serve their communities through American Red Cross training programs and volunteer activities. However, we encourage this to be done only with their parent's knowledge and supervision. For this reason, the American Red Cross follows the guidelines for interactive electronic media published by the Children’s Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau. Special notices urging children to get their parent's permission before providing any personal information have been incorporated into our site. 

Thank you for visiting our site. Please [contact us](mailto:internet@usa.redcross.org) should you have any questions about the operation of the site.
