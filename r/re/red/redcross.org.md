This Web site is owned and operated by or on behalf of the American Red Cross. We recognize that visitors to our site may be concerned about the information they provide to us, and how we treat that information. This Privacy Policy addresses those concerns. This policy may be changed or updated from time to time. 

If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: 

American Red Cross  
National Headquarters  
Office of the General Counsel  
2025 E Street NW  
Washington D.C. 20006  
or e-mail us at [info@usa.redcross.org](mailto:info@usa.redcross.org) 


We are available to answer your questions or hear your concerns. 

**Our Policy**  
The American Red Cross uses its best efforts to respect and protect the privacy of our online visitors and donors. We will not share your e-mail address with third parties.  


The American Red Cross may share _financial donor_ postal mailing lists with other non-profits for a one-time use by the other non-profit. If you are a financial donor to the American Red Cross, you may request that we withhold your mailing information from any list exchanges with other non-profits. Please e-mail us at [findev@usa.redcross.org](mailto:findev@usa.redcross.org). In the subject field, type "Do Not Exchange" and provide us your name, e-mail or postal address depending on how you made your contribution to our organization. American Red Cross lists are never sold to third parties.  


**Is Credit Card Information Secure?**  
We care about the safety and security of your transaction. We use high grade encryption and the https security protocol to communicate with your browser software. This method is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept the credit card information you send to us. Companies we work with to process credit card transactions also use high grade encryption and security protocols. Contributions may also be made by calling 1-800-HELP NOW or directly to your [local chapter](https://web.archive.org/where/where.html). 

**Is My Personal Information Secure?**  
Yes. The same high grade encryption and https security protocols used for financial transactions on our site are used in collecting personal information to schedule your blood donation. Blood donations may also be scheduled by calling 1-800-GIVE-LIFE or your local American Red Cross Blood Services Region. 

**We Care About Doing It Right**  
In addition to maintaining privacy and security controls over information you share with us, the American Red Cross works to accurately process your contribution information. During business hours, staff are available to answer questions about your financial donation or scheduled blood donation at [info@usa.redcross.org](mailto:info@usa.redcross.org). 

The American Red Cross employs error checking procedures to make certain transactions are processed completely and accurately. As necessary, changes are made to improve our systems. And, independent external and internal audits are conducted to ensure the privacy, security and appropriate processing of your information on our site. 

**How Do We Use "Cookies"?**  
Visitors should be aware that non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the American Red Cross Website through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a Website can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate the visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site, and allow a site to track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements. Cookies are not programs that come onto a visitor's system and damage files. Generally, cookies work by assigning a unique number to the visitor that has no meaning outside the assigning site. If a visitor does not want information collected through the use of cookies, there is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows the visitor to deny or accept the cookie feature. The American Red Cross uses "cookie" technology only to obtain non-personal information from its online visitors in order to improve visitors' online experience and facilitate their visit within our site. 

**Note to Parents on Our Privacy Policy**  
The American Red Cross welcomes children to learn more about our organization and, where appropriate, find opportunities to serve their communities through American Red Cross training programs and volunteer activities. However, we encourage this to be done only with their parent's knowledge and supervision. For this reason, the American Red Cross follows the guidelines for interactive electronic media published by the Children's Advertising Review Unit of the Better Business Bureau. 

Thank you for visiting our site. Please [contact us](mailto:info@usa.redcross.org) should you have any questions about the operation of the site.
