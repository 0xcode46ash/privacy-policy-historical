## Information Collection and Use

 **Information Collected Upon Visiting.** When you visit the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website ("Log Data"). This Log Data may include information such as your IP address, browser type or the domain from which you are visiting, the web-pages you visit, the search terms you use, and any advertisements or links on which you click. For most users accessing the Internet from an Internet service provider the IP address will be different every time you log on. We use Log Data to monitor the use of the Website and of our Service, and for the Website's technical administration. 

**Information Collected Upon Registration.** If you desire to have access to certain restricted sections of the Website, you will be required to become a registered user, and to submit certain personally identifiable information to Redbeacon. This happens in a number of instances, such as when you sign up for the Redbeacon service, if you desire to receive marketing materials and information, if you submit a Service Request, and/or if you create a Skill Profile to offer services through Redbeacon. Personally identifiable information that we may collect in such instances may include your full name, password, email address, street address, time zone, telephone number, cell phone number for text messages, photographs you upload, and other information that you decide to provide us with, or that you decide to include in your public profile. If you register as a Service Provider, create a Skill Profile, and/or Quote on a Service Request, we may request and store your credit card number and other personally identifiable information. 

**Optional Information.** If you create a Skill Profile, you have the opportunity to provide additional information such as your business name, logo or avatar, credentials and qualifications, year of business establishment, as well as links to your personal web site, if you have one. You may also upload a photograph portfolio of your previous work. When you respond to a Consumer's Service Request, all of this additional information is displayed to the Consumer making such Service Request. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional, but may enable you market your services more effectively and potentially win more jobs on the Website. 

If you provide an optional mobile phone number, you will receive notifications on your cellular phone in a number of cases, such as when Redbeacon updates you on a new job offer or service request, or a status change of an existing job or service request. You may sign up for notifications and modify your notification preferences to better control when Redbeacon sends you email or SMS notifications. 

If you contact us by email through the Website, we may keep a record of your contact information and correspondence, and use such information to respond to your inquiry. 

### Use of Contact Information.

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on our web site or while using our services. We do not share your personal information with others except as indicated below or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared. Under no circumstances, other than in the event of a Business Transfer (as discussed below) will Redbeacon sell, rent or lease its Consumer lists (or the Consumer list of any individual Service Provider) to a third party. 

Circumstance under which we may share your personal information:

 **To provide information to Service Providers.** We may share your personal information with Service Providers registered with Redbeacon that perform certain services on behalf of Consumers. Sharing this information with Service Providers allows them to provide an accurate Quote on the service you're requesting. The information we share is generally the information contained in the Service Request form, including the username (and first name of the Consumer when we have it), the type of service needed, when and where the service should be performed, a description of the service needed, and any photographs pertaining to the Service Request. When you accept a price quote from a Service Provider, additional information will be shared, including personally identifiable information such as the your real name, phone number, email address, and street address of the job location. 

**To Provide Information to Consumers.** If you are a registered Service Provider, we may share your personal information with Consumers requesting services through Redbeacon. Sharing this information with Consumers helps them to assess Service Provider quality and select the Service Provider to perform the service they need done. The information we share is generally the information in your Skill Profile, with the exception of your address, contact phone number, mobile phone number, and email address. In addition, we share the Quote you submitted on the Service Request and any additional information you chose to provide to the Consumer such as appointment start times, private notes, and questions about the Service Request. If you Quote on a job and your Quote is selected by the Consumer, Redbeacon will then, and only then, share your address, contact phone number, and email address with the Consumer in order to facilitate communication about the scheduled job. 

**To Facilitate Redbeacon's Use of Third-Party Services.** We engage certain trusted third parties to perform functions and provide services to us, including, without limitation, hosting and maintenance, customer relationship, database storage and management, direct marketing campaigns and User credit card information storage. We will share your personally identifiable information with these third parties, but only to the extent necessary to perform these functions and provide such services, and only pursuant to binding contractual obligations requiring such third parties to maintain the privacy and security of your data. 

**To Comply with Laws and Law Enforcement.** Redbeacon cooperates with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Redbeacon or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law. 

**In Connection with Business Transfers.** Redbeacon may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy. You will have the opportunity to opt out of any such transfer if the new entity's planned processing of your information differs materially from that set forth in this Privacy Policy. 

**To Provide Information to Redbeacon Affiliates.** We may share your personal information with a company controlled by, or under common control with, Redbeacon for any purpose permitted by this Privacy Policy.
