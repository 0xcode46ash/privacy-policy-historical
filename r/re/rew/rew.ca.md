# Privacy Policy

The Real Estate Weekly Newspaper ("REW") takes the issue of privacy seriously. When you provide information to us, we hold your personal information in the highest regard.  Generally, REW only tracks where users are going on our Web site so we can better serve the information most sought after.  When we do this, no personal information is gained about an individual user.  Rather, all user information is compiled and analyzed as group data.  This group data is for internal use and for sharing with affiliates, subsidiaries, licensees and successors.

Certain sections of REW's Web site require personal identifying information so we can fulfill your request.  All information given to REW is used only for its stated intended purpose and for general tracking. 

We will not sell your information to third parties.   

REW reserves the right to cooperate with local, provincial and national officials in any investigation requiring either personal information, including any personal information provided online through REW's Web site, or other reports about lawful or unlawful user activities on this site.

If you have any questions about REW and your privacy, please feel free to contact us [here](mailto:privacypolicy@rew.ca?subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Question).
