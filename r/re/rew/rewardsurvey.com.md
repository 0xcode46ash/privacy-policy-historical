# Privacy Policy - RewardSurvey

## Privacy Policy

RewardSurvey is committed to protecting your privacy. We appreciate your trust in us. To get the full benefit of RewardSurvey, we ask you to provide us with certain information about yourself at different points on our site. We also collect information about you when you visit our site through the use of various technologies as described in more detail below. The purpose of this policy is to inform you of what information we collect, why we collect it, what we do with it, how we protect it and how you can access it or change it. 

This policy covers only the information collected on the RewardSurvey site. Sites that link to or from our site, services, products and other functionality available on the Site but hosted by a third party, and sites hosted by our various partners, are not covered by this policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of every site that you visit. For your convenience, this policy is linked to every page where we ask for information on our site. If you have any other concerns after reading this policy, please go to our FAQ page, where many frequently asked questions about RewardSurvey are answered. If you have any additional questions, please contact customer care by e-mail at [question@RewardSurvey.com](mailto:question@RewardSurvey.com). 

You may remove yourself from our RewardSurvey database at any time. You also have the opportunity to correct or change the information you have provided to us by emailing instructions to remove your information to [customerservice@RewardSurvey.com](mailto:customerservice@RewardSurvey.com). 

#### A Special Note About Children

Persons under the age of 18 are not eligible for any offers presented by RewardSurvey. Our site is not intended for or directed to children under the age of 13. If we become aware that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we will promptly delete such information. 

#### Submitted Information

We request certain information from you on our registration, survey, and delivery forms. Some of the information we request may be considered sensitive personal data related to household income, personal or business finances, health, family and demographic information. This information is used for order fulfillment, customer service, to understand your areas of interest, to help our survey sponsors to better understand survey results, and guide us in selecting prospects for future surveys. We share this information with the publishers of the magazines you request, to third party product fulfillment companies. In some instances we may partner with other companies to provide or host some of these services, such as third party survey companies. Depending on the service, these third party companies may also collect your information for the purpose of providing the service and may only use the information you provide to perform the service, unless otherwise noted at the time your information is requested. 

#### Tracking Technology

If you have been offered our services through one of our marketing partners or affiliates (see "Use of Information" section below), we may share the information you enter with that partner or affiliate. To do so, we may use a technology called clear GIFs, which automatically and securely transfer the information you enter. In the future, we may also use other similar technologies in our offers for the same purpose. If we do so, we will modify our privacy policy accordingly. See the "Notification of Changes" section below. 

#### Log Files

We log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) in order to improve security, analyze trends and administer our offers. We may track your movement within the site, the pages from which you were referred, access times and browser types. We only use this information in aggregate and do not link it to you personally. 

#### Cookies

Cookies are small bits of data that remain on your computer hard drive that allow us to make your visit to our site more enjoyable and provide you with a more personalized experience on the site. Cookies are used for various purposes, such as remembering information that you have already entered, for instance your password and preferences, so that you will not have to re-enter them every time you visit and keeping information previously provided for certain services available on the site. They also tell us general information about how users visit our site, such as which pages they've visited and what services they use, so we can further customize the information we provide. This will make our site more valuable to you, since the information provided will be tailored to your tastes. We never use cookies to collect additional personally identifiable information about you. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can set your browser to not accept cookies, or to notify you when a cookie is being sent.
