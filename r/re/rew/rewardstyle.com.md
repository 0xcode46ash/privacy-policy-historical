## 4\. State Specific Disclosures.

For California residents: Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83, if you are a California resident and rS has an established business relationship with you, you may have the right to request information from rS, free of charge, regarding the manner in which rS shares certain categories of personal information with third parties (whether collected online or offline), for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. California law provides that you have the right to submit a request to rS at its designated address and receive the following information: 1) the categories of information rS disclosed to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; 2) the names and addresses of third parties that received such information; and 3) if the nature of a third party's business cannot be reasonably determined from the third party's name, examples of the products or services marketed, subject to certain exceptions. You are entitled to receive a copy of this information in a standardized format and the information will not be specific to you individually. For purposes of this paragraph: 

i. "rS" means rS and the Service, and 

ii. "Third Party" means: a business that is outside the rS family, and affiliates of rS. 

You will notice that the "third parties" listed in this notice may include rS affiliates. These affiliates are listed as "third parties" because, under Section 1798.83, any business that is a separate legal entity must be listed as a "third party." 

This same California law permits rS to provide you, in response to your written request, with a cost-free means to choose not to have your information shared rather than providing the above described information. 

rS's designated email address for such requests is legal@rewardstyle.com. You may also request this information by writing to: 3102 OakLawn Ave, Suite 900, Dallas, TX 75219. Additionally, you may request that rS not share your personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use by following the [Choice/Opt Out ](https://web.archive.org/privacy#choice) procedures outlined below.

rS or an affiliate network (each an "Affiliate Network Partner") may drop cookies on a consumer's device and/or web browser. For example, once a Content Publisher grabs a Product or Merchant link from our Services, visitors to that Content Publisher's website who click on the particular link will be directed by rS or the Affiliate Network Partner to a Merchant's e-commerce site, at which point rS or the Affiliate Network Partner drops a cookie on the visitor's browser. These cookies are dropped so that our Services can monetize visits to our Content Publishers. 

**You agree rS is not liable for the content or use of personal information by third parties, including, without limitation, Content Publishers and Merchants, and including their use of cookies. Users and readers of Content Publisher websites and applications, as well as Merchants' websites, should consult the privacy policies and terms of service for those individual websites.**

By agreeing to the terms of this Policy and by using our Services, you consent to the cookies referenced above being dropped on your and your visitors' web browsers and machines. **It is your responsibility to inform your visitors of the relevant data collection, use and disclosure practices through a privacy policy – see Section 8.** In order for you to be a registered and active user of the Services, you must agree to accept cookies. If you wish to opt-out of cookies altogether, send an email info@rewardstyle.com to request your account be deleted. 

## 8\. Content Publishers' Websites/Applications/Other Content. 

  1. General. When you begin using links provided by rS, we will collect and store information about each link that your users and readers click on. We use this information for commission processing and data analysis, among other things. 
  2. Requirement of Privacy Policy. **Content Publishers are solely responsible for ensuring that their own website, application or other content take all necessary and proper measures to protect personal privacy, including following a written Privacy Policy posted on such sites, and adhering to all appropriate regulations, laws and other requirements.**
  3. Promotion and Publicity. We may collect and store information about publicly accessible content on your website, application or other content (such as your website name and website content). Among other things, we may use this information to recommend certain Merchants and for advertising and marketing related activities. 



## 9\. Links. 

The Services may contain links to third party sites or third party applications, including advertisers. However, please be aware that rS is not responsible for and cannot control the terms of service or privacy policies of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services, and to read the applicable agreements for each and every site or application. The Policy applies solely to these Services. rS is not responsible for and makes no representations or warranties regarding links, including without limitation, the content, accuracy, opinions, functionality, or services provided in such linked sites or applications. Inclusion of any linked site or application on the Services does not imply approval or endorsement by rS.

## 10\. Third-Party Applications. 

rS may, in its sole discretion, provide Content Publishers with access to third-party Developer Apps which interface with rS APIs. Such Developer Apps use rS APIs, but are not endorsed by rS. Use of such Developer Apps by Content Publishers is voluntary and subject to the election by the Content Publisher, in its sole discretion, to use any Developer Apps. **Use at your own risk. By using Developer Apps, you are granting Developer Apps access rights to your Content, including without limitation related metadata. rS makes no representations or warranties regarding Content Publishers' use of any Developer Apps, or the privacy or security of data or information provided to third parties or their Developer Apps. You agree rS has no liability whatsoever for the Developer Apps, including, without limitation, the third party use of personal information provided to third parties or through Developer Apps, nor the use of cookies by third parties or Developer Apps. Content Publishers using Developer Apps should consult the privacy policies and terms of service for those individual Developer Apps.**

##  11\. Age Restrictions; Children's Privacy. 

These Services are not for use for anybody under the age of 13. By using these Services, you verify that you are 13 or older and in compliance with this provision. rS will not knowingly collect or use personal information from anyone under 13 years of age. If rS obtains actual knowledge that it has obtained personal information about a child under the age of 13, that information will be permanently deleted from our records.

##  12\. Choice/Opt Out. 

We may send push or local notifications to your device to provide updates and relevant messages. You may be able to manage notifications from the App or through your device. 

You may opt out at any time by using the Opt-Out or Unsubscribe option at the bottom of most of our mass email communications, or by contacting us through the "Contact Us" section of the Services. You may also choose to delete your account at any time. 

##  13\. Security.

To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before creating your account. The user who created the account is responsible for maintaining the secrecy of their unique password and account information at all times. 

Payment processing will be performed by a third party vendors, such as PayPal, which have their own security policies that relate to the data they process. For information about PayPal's User Agreement and Privacy Policy, please visit <https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full> and [https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/privacy-full.]()

However, information you elect to post on our Services, emails and other information you send to us are not encrypted and such transmissions cannot be considered a secure means of transmitting sensitive information.

You should be aware of the limitations of security, authentication, encryption, and privacy measures used in connection with the Internet and that any information you transmit through the Services may be damaged, corrupted, "sniffed" and/or accessed by another person without your permission. Regardless of the precautions taken by you or by us, "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from the Services. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. We cannot ensure or warrant the ultimate security of any information you transmit.
