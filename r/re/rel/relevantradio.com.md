Starboard Network™ Privacy Statement**|   
---|---  
  
Starboard Network™ is committed to protecting your privacy. Starboard Network™ is a general audience web site, intended for users of all ages. Personal information of all users is collected, used and disclosed as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**Collection of your Personal Information**

When making donations, Starboard Network™ collects personal information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address, and telephone number.  If you choose to make online donations, we will collect additional personal information, including your credit card number and billing address, in order to process the transaction. 

**Use of your Personal Information**

Starboard Network™ collects and uses your personal information to deliver the services you have requested (such as email correspondence and credit card billing). Starboard Network™ does not use or disclose any personal information without your explicit consent.

Starboard Network™ may contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

Starboard Network™ does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.   We may occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will only provide those companies the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information and are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

Starboard Network™ may access and/or disclose your personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Starboard Network™ or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Starboard Network™; or (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Starboard Network™ services or members of the public.

Personal information collected on this site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Starboard Network™ or its subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using this site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country. 

**Control your Personal Information**

Starboard Network™ offers choices for the collection, use and sharing of personal information. You may choose not to receive marketing material from Starboard Network™.  You may also stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Starboard Network™ by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. The instructions explain how to stop receiving such e-mails.

There are some Starboard Network™ services that send out periodic e-mails informing you of technical service issues, service surveys, new feature announcements, and news about Starboard Network™ products and services. You will not be able to unsubscribe to these mailings, as they are considered a part of the service you have chosen.

 **Security of your Personal Information**

Starboard Network™ is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

 **Use of Cookies**

Starboard Network™ may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. For example, if you register with the Starboard Network™ site or services, a cookie helps Starboard Network™ to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to Starboard Network™, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Starboard Network™ features that you customized.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Starboard Network™ services or Web sites you visit.
