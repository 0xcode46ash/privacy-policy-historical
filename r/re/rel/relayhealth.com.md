**SECURITY MEASURES**

RelayHealth employs a high degree of security consciousness. The environment at RelayHealth currently encompasses the highest level of security as well as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) security tenets that of the proposed regulations. The overall priorities of RelayHealth as an organization are to ensure security and be fully compliant with all HIPAA regulations, proposed and finalized. Access, integrity, availability, ownership, authorization, dependability, authentication, and confidentiality are all major considerations within the RelayHealth Security Policy. 

RelayHealth upholds its stringent Security Policy with the following security measures: 

· _**Audit Trail.**_ RelayHealth maintains an audit trail and log of accesses to your medical profile. 

· _**Role-Based Usage**_. RelayHealth grants varying degrees of access to users with different levels of authority within a provider practice. 

· _**Encryption**_. All communication between you and the RelayHealth server is secured by using SSL version 3.0, which uses 128-bit encryption. This is the highest level of encryption currently available commercially. 

· _**Data Security**_. RelayHealth is taking all reasonable measures to secure your data on our servers, in our data center. Our data center is both physically and electronically secured. Our servers are isolated from the Internet by using a firewall which is a hardware and software system that blocks access by unauthorized parties. 

· **_Confidentiality_**. RelayHealth has internal policies that keep your data private and confidential, and will not share your data with any other party. 

· **_Login ID and Password._** Access to your account is controlled by a login ID and a password, which you chose. Strict login ID and password rules virtually eliminate the unauthorized user from gaining access. 

· **_Auto-Logoff._** RelayHealth protects you against accidentally leaving your personal information active on a computer browser screen. The RelayHealth service ends your “session” if you are logged in to RelayHealth but have not actively used the service for a set period of time. This prevents others from accessing your account when you leave a session and forget to log out. 

· **_Digital Certificates._** RelayHealth uses a digital certificate issued by RSA Data Security, Inc., a leading Secure Server Certification Authority. This gives you the confidence that you are connected to a site operated by RelayHealth, and authenticated as such. 

· **_Sensitive Information._** RelayHealth handles all your health information with respect to its confidentiality and privacy. We ask that you follow your provider’s policy on communicating sensitive information in their practice. 

· **_Business Partners._** We require people we do business with to obey privacy and security laws and respect HIPAA regulations. 

· **_Disaster Recovery._** We currently utilize the highest levels of disaster recovery available on the market which ensure uptime by preventing outages caused by power, security, environment, fire, and natural disasters. Within these facilities, RelayHealth is able to deliver the highest levels of reliability through a number of redundant subsystems, such as multiple Internet trunks coming into from multiple sources, fully redundant power on the premises, and multiple backup generators. 

· **_Data Integrity._** RelayHealth employs the latest products and technology to ensure data is always available and access to the site continues without interruption.

Last Updated 0ctober 18, 2002

RelayHealth respects your privacy and takes Internet privacy very seriously. By accepting RelayHealth’s Terms of Use, you consent to the use and disclosure of personally identifiable information provided to us as outlined in this Privacy Policy.

**Who Is Collecting Information?**

Because RelayHealth provides a service for Web-based communication between you and your Provider (your doctor or healthcare professional), we ask you for the sort of personal information your Provider's office needs in order to respond to and streamline the processing of your requests.

We will not sell, share or rent this information that is collected in the RelayHealth service to others in ways different than from what is disclosed in this policy. RelayHealth collects information from you at several points in our service. 

**What Information Is Collected?**

  * **Subscriber Contact Information.**
    * **Information Request**. If you wish to request more information about RelayHealth prior to registering, you are required to provide contact information (for example, name and e-mail address). It is optional for you to provide additional contact information (for example, health plan and physician). This information will be used by RelayHealth to contact you about our services. 
    * **Pre-Registration**. At your option and based upon consents received from you by your physician, your physician or a member of your physician’s staff may elect to pre-register you for RelayHealth. The pre-registration process requires the collection of contact information about you (for example, name and physician). Your Provider may provide additional information based on their information (for example, health plan) which we collect.. This information will be used by RelayHealth to contact you about our services. In order to complete registration to use RelayHealth, you will be asked to confirm the information provided and agree to RelayHealth’s Terms of Use. You may request not to receive information from RelayHealth at any time. 
    * **Registration**. No matter how you arrive at RelayHealth, we require the collection of certain contact information as part of the registration process (for example, name, e-mail address, home zip code, birth date). You may provide additional contact information (for example, health plan, health plan subscriber ID number, home phone number, and home address). We encourage you to provide this information in order to enable optimal use of our service. In many cases, you will be asked to enter this contact information directly. In other cases, that information may be pre-filled if you have already provided it to a related product or registration process of a business partner site and have consented to its disclosure to RelayHealth through that business partner site. In circumstances where the information has been pre-filled by someone other than you, you will be asked to confirm the information provided and agree to RelayHealth’s Terms of Use before being able to use RelayHealth.

If you arrive at RelayHealth directly, the registration process requires you to choose a unique identifier (for example, sign in name and password) for your account. If you arrive at RelayHealth through a business partner site, the business partner site may provide a unique identifier that confirms to RelayHealth that you are an authorized member from the business partner site. You will be asked to confirm the information provided and agree to RelayHealth’s Terms of Use before being able to use RelayHealth. 

    * **Newsletters.**
. If you are not registered and you wish to subscribe to a RelayHealth newsletter, we request contact information (for example, name and e-mail address) to send the newsletter to you. You may elect to opt-out of receiving these newsletters at any time. 
  * **Subscriber Medical Information.**
    * **Provider-Patient Communications** The purpose of RelayHealth is to provide you and your physician, Provider-Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group with the ability to communicate with each other regarding medical issues and/or general health matters. RelayHealth offers various messaging platforms relating to specific requests and/or purposes to facilitate these communications (for example, Referral Requests, Prescription Renewal Request; Appointment Request). Either you or your Provider, Provider-Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group can initiate such messages and/or communications. Your response and/or provision of information regarding these communications is voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information provided via these communications may be used to update your Health Record. In addition, by initiating and/or responding to such communications, your Health Record will be accessible to your Provider, Provider-Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group.

Certain communications (for example, e-mails, messages) are recorded and maintained by RelayHealth. RelayHealth will not edit the content of the communication between you and your Provider, Provider-Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group. RelayHealth considers these communications to be personal and private and will not use or disclose these communications except as provided for in this Privacy Policy or where required by law or unless you agree to additional use and disclosure of information provided via RelayHealth. However RelayHealth may block or remove certain communications materials (for example, offensive or otherwise unacceptable materials for which a complaint has been reported). 

    * **Provider Health Information** From time to time, your physician or a member of your physician’s staff may provide medical or other information contained in their medical records or patient files to update or supplement your Health Record or other information about you in our service. This may include sharing of information about you via integration between our service and certain systems used by your physician containing information about you (for example, medical record-keeping/storage systems, billing systems).

In addition, RelayHealth may share information provided by you in your Health Record or in our service to update and supplement your medical or other information with your Provider or contained in your Provider’s systems.

You have the ability to enter information into your Health Record directly. In addition, where you have authorized another person ( a “Patient Account Manager”) to access your Health Record, those individuals authorized by you will also have the ability to enter information into your Health Record. Your Provider, a Provider Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group may also enter information into your Health Record. 
    * **Pre-Filled Health Record.** In certain cases and at your election, you may be able to opt-in to having your Health Record information pre-filled and updated by a business partner where that business partner has obtained the necessary consents from you to disclose this information to RelayHealth. In addition, at your option and based upon consents received from you by your physician, your physician may elect to pre-fill medical information and create a Health Record for you via RelayHealth. The creation of a Health Record may include the collection of contact information, as well as certain health information about you, including health conditions, medications and allergies.

_**What does RelayHealth do with anonymous (de-identified) information?**_

RelayHealth removes your identity from your personal information (contact, health and/or financial) and may work with it as anonymous ("de-identified") information.

Individual information is information about a user presented in a form where information about one anonymous user would be indistinguishable from information relating to other anonymous users ("a 40 year old female"). Individual information is not in a form that allows anyone studying the information to personally identify any user.

Aggregate information is information that describes the habits, usage patterns and/or demographics of users as a group but does not reveal the identity of particular users. Your anonymous data is combined with the anonymous data of other RelayHealth users and becomes statistics. 

We might use aggregate information within RelayHealth to understand the needs of the RelayHealth community of users and determine what kinds of programs and services we can help your Provider offer to you. RelayHealth could use this anonymous information to give potential users, providers, or business partners a picture of the RelayHealth community and services.

Aggregate information may be provided or sold to third parties. Absolutely no personal identifying information is included in the aggregate reports; each individual remains anonymous. 

Locator information is your name, electronic messaging address, physical address, and / or other data that enables someone to personally identify you. RelayHealth and your Internet Access Provider may use Locator Information as is necessary to enforce any of the terms of the RelayHealth Terms of Use.

**Can Patients Opt-Out Or Opt-In To Specific Uses Of Their Information?**

  * **Medical Information.**
    * Unless your Provider has pre-registered you, if you wish to share your medical information with your Provider, you must authorize this Provider by sending a message to which the Provider accepts you as a patient in the RelayHealth System. Your Provider has the ability to assign Provider-Designated Users and/or members of a Provider Group to receive your messages on his/her behalf and update/access your Health Record and other medical and health information. 
    * If you no longer wish to allow a Provider, Provider-Designated User or authorized member of a Provider Group to view your medical information, you may deactivate the Provider, Provider-Designated User and authorized member of a Provider Group by selecting the Provider deactivation option. The Provider, Provider-Designated User and authorized member of the Provider Group will be able to view a static version of your Health Record as of the deactivation, but will no longer be able to view updates to your Health Record. 
    * You have the ability to request the activation or deactivation the authorization of a Patient Account Manager at any time by notifying your Provider. Once your Provider deactivates a Patient Account Manager, they will be able to view a static version of your Health Record as of the deactivation, but will no longer be able to view updates to your Health Record.
