We also use social buttons provided by services like Twitter and Facebook. We are not responsible for the privacy policies and/or practices of these third party services, and you are responsible for reading and understanding those third party services' privacy policies.

In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

We might also share personal information you have provided to us without your consent, in case we believe:

  * doing so is appropriate to carry out your own request;
  * it's needed to detect, prevent or address fraud, security or technical issues;
  * it's needed to otherwise protect our property, legal rights, or that of others.

### Privacy Zone

Some third party applications allow you to create a ‘privacy zone’, which will hide your exact location within this zone.
