**Our Privacy Commitment**  
Reliant Energy knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Statement outlines the information Reliant Energy will collect and how we will use that information. This statement will also explain how you can make your preference known regarding when Reliant Energy may send marketing communications to you.

**What Information We Collect**  
Reliant Energy's primary goal in collecting information is to allow us to offer products and services which are relevant to consumers like you. Personal information also allows us to provide services and features that most likely meet your needs, and to customize our service to make your experience smooth and efficient. Any personal information that we collect will only be used for internal marketing purposes of Reliant Energy, except as otherwise required by law or as disclosed to you in this Privacy Statement.

**Information You Give Us**  
Reliant Energy will not collect any personal information from you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We may ask you to provide information including your name, address, government-issued identification card number, social security number, telephone number, and email address. In addition, we may ask you to provide information relating to energy use, such as the characteristics of your home, your age, gender and family size, or we may ask you to state your opinion about potential products and services. If you opt not to provide us with personal information,we may be unable to deliver certain promotions or product information to you that you have requested.

**Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data**  
Reliant Energy may collect certain non-personal or aggregate data. For example, we may use web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) and use cookies when you visit many of our web pages. For instance, when you visit one of our web sites, our web server will automatically recognize some non-personal information, including but not limited to the date and time you visited our site, the pages you visited, the referrer (the web site you came from), the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using (e.g., Windows or Mac OS), and the domain name and address of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

**Email Addresses**    
At the time Reliant Energy requests an email address from you, you will be given the opportunity to indicate whether or not you wish to receive future email solicitations from us. We may, however, send you emails for other reasons such as responding to your requests for service or information or matters relative to your account.

**Information from Other Sources**    
For reasons such as providing better product recommendations or special offers that we think will interest you and to identify persons not already a Reliant Energy customer, we receive information from other sources and add it to our information. The type of information we receive may include (but is not limited to) your name, address, telephone number, and in some cases, type and characteristics of your home, your age, and _statistical estimates_ of your family size, income and home value. We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information so that we can correct our records and deliver your next communication more easily.

**How We Use Your Information**

**Personal Information  
**We may use your personal information to contact you. For example, we may send you marketing or promotional materials including emails or other information; we may respond to your comments or requests for information; or we may contact you if needed in the course of fulfilling your service request. We may also use your personal information to confirm and verify your customer enrollment status, and for credit approval.

Reliant Energy does not collect personal information automatically, but we may combine non-personal information collected automatically (e.g., through cookies and web beacons) with your previously submitted personal information. We may also enhance or merge personal information with data obtained from third parties for the same purposes.  

We use this personal and statistical information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts; to statistically analyze site usage; to improve our content and product offerings; and to customize our sites' content, layout and services. We may also use your information to deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, such as targeted banners, new services and promotions. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our visitors' needs.

Reliant Energy occasionally sends emails describing new products, promotions or events. These email services are optional and you may opt-out of these services completely, at any time.

**Non-personal, Aggregate and Statistical Data**  
Reliant Energy uses web log information (such as your web browser, operating system, pages visited, etc.) to help us design our web site, to identify popular features, and for other managerial purposes. However, web logs may be used if necessary to help identify any person attempting to break into or damage our web site. We may share web log information with law enforcement agencies if we believe that we have evidence of a violation of computer security or related laws.

**How We May Share Information with Other Businesses**

**For Promotional Purposes** **  
** Except in the event of a business transfer, we will **_not_** share, trade or sell personal information about you for promotional use by any business, other than Reliant Energy and its affiliates. However, we may sometimes send offers to Reliant Energy customers on behalf of other businesses. When we do this, we do not give that business the name, address, telephone number or email address of our customers.

When companies acquire other businesses, sell all, or portions of their business, customer information generally is one of the transferred assets. If Reliant Energy or substantially all of its assets are transferred through merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or any other change of corporate control then, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.

Aggregated and statistical data from our web site visitors may be shared with our partners. For example, we may let a partner know that approximately "20,000 people visited a web page regarding a specific joint promotion."

All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Reliant Energy for work that involves access to personal information are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Reliant Energy.

**For Protection of Reliant Energy and Others**  
We may release personal data, including account information, when we believe release is appropriate to comply with laws, regulations or judicial orders; or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Reliant Energy, our customers, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

Reliant Energy also reserves the right to share the information to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities or where required by law or regulation.

We use two suppression files provided by the Direct Marketing Association, the Mail Preference Service and Telephone Preference Service files; and we use the National Do Not Call Registry. In addition, we use the Statewide do-not-call and Electric do-not-call lists maintained by the Public Utility Commission of Texas. The Statewide do-not-call list is used to identify those consumers that do not wish to be contacted by telephone regarding any solicitation. The Electric do-not-call list is used to identify consumers or businesses that do not wish to be contacted by telephone regarding their choice of electric provider.
