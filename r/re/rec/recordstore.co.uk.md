#### What data we collect about you and why

  * When you use the Website, there are different ways we and any service providers who assist us in managing the Website gather information about you. When you register with us, we ask for information such as your name, email address, postal address and contact details. We keep a record of this information and any other information relating to you that we may obtain from our suppliers or other third parties. This record will be stored and processed in the United Kingdom and other countries (see further below under “How we store data about you” and “How we use personal data about you”). All this is necessary for us to recognise you, provide you with the services or information you have requested from us and, where appropriate, to maintain your account with us. In addition to the uses described below, we may also use this information to improve our platform and prevent or detect abuses of our Website. You may also be required to provide personal data to order products or participate in one of our online forums or communities. You are under no obligation to provide such data. However, if you should choose to withhold requested information, we may not be able to provide you with certain services.

  * We keep a record of any electronic correspondence you send us. This helps us to keep track of any problems or concerns you may have had with our Website or services.

  * If retail opportunities are provided, when you place an order, a third party payment processor will collect a credit card number or other payment account number. This record will be stored and processed in the United Kingdom and other countries (see further below under “How we store data about you” and “How we use personal data about you”).

  * Please note that sometimes on particular web pages on the Website we will require you to provide additional personal data. When we do this we will specify further on these web pages why we are collecting this data and how we will use it.

  * All payments transactions will be encrypted.




#### Analysis Tools and our use of cookies

  * We currently use analytic companies (such as [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)) to analyse how visitors use our Website and to find ways of improving it. To do this, we use Web beacons, pixel tags, clear GIFs and cookies on the Website; these are text files that collect and log site user behaviour information including IP addresses (the number automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider) in an anonymous form. The information collected is transmitted to the relevant analytic companies and used to compile statistical reports for us. The information concerned is not used to track or collect any information which may be used to identify a particular individual. All information is used and held anonymously.

  * We may also use cookies and other technologies to optimise your experience on the Website. Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your hard drive to store and sometimes track information about you. Cookies can be used to recognise users when they return and may help us to customise the Website for you based on your preferences. Cookies may also be used to identify the user’s geographic location and enable us to restrict particular services to users in certain countries. Although they do identify a user's computer, cookies do not personally identify users and passwords and credit card information are not stored in cookies.

  * We control how the data collected from our cookies and other technologies may and may not be used. If you do not want to help us to learn how to improve our Website, products, offers and marketing strategy, you can "opt-out" of our ability to analyse such data and disable cookies by modifying the settings in your browser. Please note that this might affect some functionality on the Website. For more information about cookies and how to disable them, please go to [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

Please read any such third party’s policy carefully before providing any personal data on such websites.

We sometimes may offer content (e.g., competitions, sweepstakes, or promotions) sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties. By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that you voluntarily submit to participate in the Website activity. We are not responsible for and have no control over these third parties' use of this information. However, we will notify you at the time of requesting personally identifiable information if these third parties will obtain such information.

#### Legal disclaimer

We are not responsible nor will be liable to you in any way for events beyond our direct control and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, we cannot guarantee nor do we represent that our performance will be error free, and to the maximum extent permitted by law we will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages or other loss suffered by you and relating to the use or release of your personal data.
