## Information We Collect

We collect personal information in a few different ways. One way in which we collect personal information is directly from the user. For example, you may provide personal information such as name, email address and telephone number if you register for an account, sign up for a webinar or contact us for additional information. Certain personally identifiable information may also be provided by other registered users of the Site. Information which can be used to personally identify you may also be obtained by us from information you provide on the Site (including through posting material on the Site, inputting search queries or completing surveys or polls) to the Site. If you do not wish for personally identifiable information to be shared with the Site for the purposes described herein, do not provide or upload such information. 

Through the Site, we automatically gather certain information about the use of the Site, such as how frequently certain areas of the Site are visited and the date and time of Site visits, IP addresses and browser information, including through the use of cookies, web beacons and other technologies. Most browsers can be set to prevent cookies or to notify you when one is being placed; however, cookies are necessary to access and use the Site. Your browser may allow you to delete the cookies after using the Site. 

The Site also makes use of a technology designed to enhance your experience and to provide aggregate non-personally identifiable information about the use of the Site to us. By using the Site, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. 

##  How We Use and Disclose Your Information 

We will not use, share or disclose your information to anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise consented to by you. 

We use your information, including personally identifiable information, in order to administer your account and allow you to use the Site and its content (including through mobile applications). We use your information to support and enhance your use of the Site and its features, including tracking emails you send. 

We also use your personally identifiable information for any purpose for which you provide it (for example, if you wish to share your email address or personal information with another user). In addition, we may send you service or promotional communications, including notifying you of new services or offerings or changes to the Site or this Privacy Policy. You can opt-out of receiving these emails by contacting us at [privacy@recsolu.com](mailto:privacy@recsolu.com). 

You should be aware we have no control over third-party websites or links which you may be invited to view or register, and our privacy policy does not apply to these third-party websites or links. Please consult the privacy policy of such websites or links you are visiting. 

We may use your information to enable us to display advertisements to third parties’ target audiences. Even though we do not disclose your personally identifiable information for these purposes without your consent, if you click on or otherwise interact with an advertisement, the advertiser may assume you meet its target criteria. 

We may disclose and transfer information (including personally identifiable information) as an asset in connection with a proposed or actual merger or sale (including any transfers made as part of an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding) involving all or part of our business (whether as a going-concern or not) or as part of a corporate reorganization, stock sale or other change in control. 

We reserve the right to disclose information in order to comply with a subpoena, court order, administrative or governmental order, or any other requirement of law, or when we, in our sole discretion, believe it is necessary in order to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property or to fight fraud and credit risk reduction. If you use a publicly accessible area of the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected or used by any person for any purpose. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable or other information you choose to submit in these public forums. We may retain records of all publicly accessible areas of the Site. 

We use non-personally identifiable information in the aggregate, so we can improve the Site and for business and administrative purposes. We may also use or share with third parties for any purpose aggregated data that contains no personally identifiable information. 

##  Choices regarding Your Information 

We strive to provide you with choices regarding your personally identifiable information. We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information: 

  * Tracking Technologies and Advertising. You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. To learn how you can manage your cookie settings, visit your browser settings and help pages. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that the Site may then be inaccessible or not function properly. 
  * Promotional Offers and Newsletters from the Company. If you do not wish to have your contact information used by the Company to promote our own or third-parties' products or services or receive our newsletters, you can opt-out by contacting us at [privacy@recsolu.com](mailto:privacy@recsolu.com). This opt-out does not apply to information provided to the Company as a result of product service experience requests. 



We do not control third parties' collection or use of your information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. 

##  How We Protect Your Information 

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved. 

In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to your information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access. 

Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to the Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site. 

The safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share your password with anyone. We also urge you to be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site. 

##  Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences 

If you are a registered user, you may access and update, correct or delete your registration and other personal information by logging into the Site and modifying your user profile or by sending us an email at [privacy@recsolu.com](mailto:privacy@recsolu.com). You may also close your account at any time by contacting us at [privacy@recsolu.com](mailto:privacy@recsolu.com). We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement your request promptly, but it may take some time to process your request. 

While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of your information, we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of your information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. Please note that in some instances we may not be able to delete your personal information except by closing your user account. We will notify you if we are not able to accommodate your request or if we have elected to close your account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request. 

RECSOLU may retain copies of your personal information even after you have closed your account in order to comply with its legal obligations, pursuant to its standard data retention practices and for a reasonable period following such closure to be able to address any potential disputes. Except in extraordinary circumstances or when prohibited by applicable law, RECSOLU takes commercially reasonable efforts to de-personalize any information retained from closed accounts no later than one (1) year following such closure. 

##  Children's Privacy and Parental Controls 

We do not solicit any personal information from children. If you are not 18 or older, you are not authorized to use the Site. Parents should be aware there are parental control tools available online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors. 

##  California Privacy Rights 

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits users of the Site who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to [privacy@recsolu.com](mailto:privacy@recsolu.com). 

##  Privacy Policy Changes 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy for the Site, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here, and post a notice on the Site’s home page indicating the Privacy Policy has changed, so you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we may disclose it to anyone. If we make changes to how we treat your personal information, we will notify you by e-mail. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you, and for periodically visiting the Site and this privacy policy to check for any changes. Your continued use of the Site indicates your consent to the then current Privacy Policy as posted. If you do not consent to the changes to the Privacy Policy, you should not continue to access or use the Site.
