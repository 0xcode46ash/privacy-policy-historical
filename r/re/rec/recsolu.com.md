## Third Party Disclosures

We may disclose the personal information of our Customer’s Data Sources to third parties as necessary to provide our services to our Customers. Such third parties may include vendors who we utilize for the provision of our services. The purpose of such disclosure is to provide our services to our Customers, and may include the subprocessing of such personal information between our Site, the Mobile Apps, and our and our Customer’s networks; the parsing of such personal information to allow our Customers to filter through the information that the Data Sources voluntarily provide to our Customers via the Site or Mobile Apps, and, generally, allowing our Customers to build a work candidate database based on the information provided by Data Sources and manage their recruitment process. We are liable for appropriate onward transfers of personal data to third parties.

## Choices Regarding Customer Information

We strive to provide our Customers with choices regarding their personally identifiable information. We have created mechanisms to provide our Customers with control over such information:

  * Tracking Technologies and Advertising. Customers can set their browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or an alert when cookies are being sent. To learn how to manage cookie settings, visit the applicable browser’s settings and help pages. If a Customer disables or refuses cookies, please note that the Site or Mobile Apps may then be inaccessible or not function properly.


  * Promotional Offers and Newsletters from us. If a Customer does not wish to have its contact information used by us to promote our own products or services or receive our newsletters, it can opt-out by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. This opt-out does not apply to information provided to us as a result of product service experience requests.



## Choices regarding Data Source Information

Upon written request from a Data Source, with proper verification of identity at our sole discretion (e.g. via certification from a notary public), we can promptly destroy, correct, amend and/or return, to such verified Data Source, any and all personally identifiable information in our or our subprocessor’s control or possession, subject to our right to retain such information as deemed necessary to comply with legal obligations. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond to such requests within forty-five (45) days of receipt of such request and identity verification. All requests in this regard should be submitted via email to privacy@yello.co.

## How We Protect Information

We are committed to protecting the information we receive from our Customers and their Data Sources. We follow reasonable technical and management practices to help protect the confidentiality, security and integrity of data stored on our system on the Site and on the Mobile Apps, including from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. While no computer system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.

In addition, only those employees and third parties who need access to personal information in order to perform their duties are allowed such access.

Although we do our best to protect the personal information of our Customers and Data Sources, we cannot guarantee the security of personal information transmitted to the Site or Mobile Apps. ANY TRANSMISSION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS AT THE CUSTOMER’S OR THE DATA SOURCE’S OWN RISK. WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CIRCUMVENTION OF ANY PRIVACY SETTINGS OR SECURITY MEASURES CONTAINED ON THE SITE OR MOBILE APPS.

The safety and security of personal information also depends on the Customers and Data Sources. Where we have given the Customer or Data Sources (or where they have chosen) a password for access to certain parts of the Site or Mobile Apps, the aforementioned Customer or Data Source is responsible for keeping this password confidential. Customer and Data Sources must not share passwords with anyone. Customer and Data Sources must also take all reasonable steps to ensure the protection of their personal information, including, but not limited to, the personally identifiable information, and must be careful about giving out information in public areas of the Site or Mobile Apps or elsewhere.

## Accessing and Updating Personal Information and Preferences of Customers

Authorized Users of our Customers may access and update, correct or delete registration and other personal information by logging into the Site or Mobile Apps and modifying their user profile, or by sending us an email at privacy@yello.co. Customers may also close their account at any time by contacting us at privacy@yello.co. We will take commercially reasonable steps to implement our Customers’ requests promptly, but it may take some time to process.

While we make efforts to accommodate requests to restrict our use of personal information, we reserve the right to delete all or any portion of a Customer or Data Source’s information if we are not able to reasonably accommodate a requested restriction. Please note that in some instances we may not be able to delete the personal information or our Customers or their Data Sources except by closing such Customer’s user account. We will notify our Customers if we are not able to accommodate their requests or if we have elected to close a Customer account as a result of a failure to accommodate such request.

We may retain copies of a Customer’s personal information even after it has closed its account in order to comply with legal obligations, pursuant to our data retention practices and for a reasonable period following such closure to be able to address any potential disputes.

## Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls

We do not solicit any personal information from children. IF A CUSTOMER OR DATA SOURCE IS NOT 16 OR OLDER, HE OR SHE MUST NOT USE THE SITE OR THE MOBILE APPS. Parents should be aware there are parental control tools available online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.

## California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section § 1798.83 permits Customers and Data Sources who utilize the Site or Mobile Apps and who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an e-mail to privacy@yello.co.

## Subject to Federal Trade Commission’s Authority

It is important to note that we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement power of the Federal Trade Commission, which protects consumers by stopping unfair, deceptive or fraudulent practices in the marketplace.

## Human Resources Data and EU Data Protection Authorities

We process human resources data from the EU for use in the context of the employment relationship under the Privacy Shield. We commit to cooperate with EU data protection authorities (DPAs) with regard to human resources data transferred from the EU in the context of the employment relationship and to comply with the advice given by such authorities with respect to such data.

## Privacy Policy Changes

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post the revised Privacy Policy here. Customers are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address on file, and both the Customers and their Data Sources are responsible for periodically visiting the Site and this Privacy Policy to check for any changes. Continued use of the Site or Mobile Apps indicates consent to the then current Privacy Policy as posted. If a Customer or Data Source does not consent to the changes to the Privacy Policy, he or she must not continue to access or use the Site or the Mobile Apps, and may reach out to us at privacy@yello.co to object and/or to obtain for more information.
