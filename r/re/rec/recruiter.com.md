**Use and Privacy of Profiles**   
Recruiter.com allows for the creation of accounts and profiles which are publicly searchable on the Internet and viewable by anyone. Information on your profile, such as but not limited to your photo, job title, and company, may be used to identify you personally by anyone. Users expressly agree that the information they upload to Recruiter.com is not sensitive or personal in nature and is true and accurate. 

While Recruiter.com allows for the creation of anonymous profiles, it may be possible for other people to determine a user's personal identity. Recruiter.com cannot offer any guarantee or promise of anonymity to its users. Users expressly agree to be solely responsible for maintaining the anonymity of their profile and that they will not hold Recruiter.com liable for this responsibility in any way. Additionally, as the Internet is not a secure environment, Recruiter.com will not be liable for security breaches or for the actions of other people or users which attempt or do exploit, publish, use, transmit, or otherwise make public the personal identity or information of users. Users of Recruiter.com agree that their anonymity cannot be guaranteed by Recruiter.com and that they create profiles and accounts at their own risk. 

**Collection of Your Personal Information**   
Recruiter.com may collect personally identifiable information, such as your name and other information. If you purchase Recruiter.com's products and services, we collect billing and credit card information. This information is used to complete the purchase transaction. Recruiter.com may also collect anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your age, household income and salary. We may gather additional personal or non-personal information in the future. 

Please take care not to submit any sensitive or private information to other members or users of the site and do not submit any sensitive or private information in your public profile. Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally sensitive data through Recruiter.com's public message boards, profiles, or user messaging, this information may be collected and used by others. Users which transmit confidential, personal, private, personally identifiable, or sensitive data to other users through messaging, through their profile, or in any other way on Recruiter.com do so at their sole risk and Recruiter.com will not be liable in any way. 

Information about your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by Recruiter.com. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Recruiter.com website. 

Recruiter.com encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from Recruiter.com so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. Recruiter.com is not responsible for the privacy statements or other content on websites outside of the Recruiter.com website. 

Recruiter.com may collect sensitive data such as credit card information. The transmission of that sensitive data is protected by SSL encryption. After sensitive information is stored on our servers, we also encrypt the data. Since the Internet is inherently not 100% secure, Recruiter.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any of the information that you send us. We cannot ensure or guarantee that any information, including sensitive information, will not be disclosed, accessed, or otherwise tampered with. The security of your information is your own responsibility - please exercise great care in how you submit sensitive information.

**Use of Cookies**   
The Recruiter.com website may use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Recruiter.com pages, or register with Recruiter.com site or services, a cookie helps Recruiter.com to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Recruiter.com website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Recruiter.com features that you customized. 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the Recruiter.com services or websites you visit. 

**Security of Your Personal Information**   
Recruiter.com makes its best efforts to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. Since the Internet is inherently not 100% secure, Recruiter.com cannot ensure or warrant the security of any of the information that you send us. We cannot ensure or guarantee that any information, including sensitive information, will not be disclosed, accessed, or otherwise tampered with. The security of your information is your own responsibility - please exercise great care in how you submit sensitive information.
