# Privacy Policy - Recipezaar

**Privacy Policy** At Recipezaar.com, we are very concerned about protecting your privacy. We only gather information about you in order to personalize the experience. We have detailed below exactly what we track and how we use that information, but our basic rule and guiding principle is this: 

> _You are OUR customer. The information you give to us stays with US. We do not give it out on the site and we do not give any personally identifying information to our advertisers or partners. Which means even your email address stays a secret between you and Recipezaar.com._

**What We Track? How We Use It?**

**Anonymous visitors:** You can browse Recipezaar.com without entering any personal information and therefore remain anonymous during your visit. Recipezaar.com logs IP addresses, browser types, referring sites and page hits but we do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user's session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. We do this for systems administration purposes and these logs will be analyzed to constantly improve the value of the materials available on the website.

**Registered users:** We hope that all of our visitors will register with us so that we can learn more about our valuable customers and they can use some of the personalization features of the site. Our registration form asks users for name, email address, preferences, and various types of optional demographic information. We use this information to identify you for personalized services on the site, e.g. a personalized cookbook of stored recipes and shopping list. We share aggregate demographic information with our advertisers and partners so that they know the type of people they are reaching on the Cookpoint site, but this is done completely anonymously for you, i.e. we do not share your email address or otherwise identify you specifically in that data.

Your name and email address are used to send you our newsletter containing product updates and special offers. If you would rather not receive the newsletter, but would still like to register, please indicate your preference by marking the appropriate box presented on the registration form.

We personalize your Recipezaar.com experience by using your recipe ratings and saved cookbook to shape our recommendations about the recipes and other information that might be of interest to you.

When you send a recipe to a friend on our site, we never disclose that email address to advertisers or partners, but we may use that address to send them a one-time email message of other information about Recipezaar.com.

There are places on the site where you can post your own private information (when posting a recipe, commenting on a recipe, in bulletin boards, etc.). We allow this ability only for registered users so that we can hold people responsible for their postings or verify changes as necessary. We are not responsible for what you post, but will operate in good faith and in as timely a manner as possible to correct or withdraw information as deemed appropriate in our [Terms of Services Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20001207152400id_/http%3A//recipezaar.com/about/tos.zsp). Please review our terms of service agreement.

**Recipe posters:** Only when a user decides to post a recipe on our site we will ask for address information. This contact information will only be used to send users the profit-sharing for their recipe, as they are entitled. This information will in no way be used for marketing purposes by Recipezaar.com, nor will it be shared with any third parties, including our partners. 

**Cookies:** Our site uses cookies to remember passwords for you so you don't have to re-enter them each time you visit Recipezaar.com. We also use cookies to provide our visitors with a tailored user experience that will be of more interest to you. You have the option of setting your browser to reject cookies, which will simply mean you must login to Cookpoint everytime you want to use the personalization features.

**Updating your information or opt-out of newsletter:** If you would like to correct and/or update your registration information, please use the [member services page](https://web.archive.org/members/).

**Links:** Recipezaar.com contains links to other Web sites. Please be aware that our privacy policy does not apply to these linked sites. We encourage you to read the posted privacy statement whenever interacting with any Web site. 

**Sharing the information we gather with others:** Recipezaar.com does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others. We may provide aggregate statistics about our users, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. Recipezaar.com may release account information when we believe, in good faith, that such release is reasonably necessary to (i) comply with law, (ii) enforce or apply the terms of any of our service agreements or (iii) protect the rights, property or safety of Recipezaar.com, our users or others.

**Your consent:** By using Recipezaar.com, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Recipezaar.com. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose. We retain the right to change these policies at any time.
