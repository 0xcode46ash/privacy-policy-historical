# Privacy policy

 Privacy Information Management Statement

Reckon Limited ("Quicken") publishes and distributes a range of personal and business financial management software and provides technical support and training services to software end-users. We are required to comply with the National Privacy Principles contained in the Privacy Act 1988. 

The privacy and security of the personal information that we hold about you is very important to us. This Statement is a requirement of the National Privacy Principles, and should assist you in understanding how we collect and deal with your personal information. 

 Collection of Personal Information

We most commonly collect information from our customers in the following circumstances: 

  * Upon registration by you of any of the Quicken software range or services offered through the [www.quicken.com.au](http://www.quicken.com.au/) website. 
  * Upon the purchasing of upgraded versions of Quicken software, often in response to our having communicated with you about such upgrades 
  * Upon the joining, or renewal, of various Quicken programs, including Quicken Advantage or the Quicken Professional Partner program. 

There are other less frequent instances where we collect personal information, such as when financial details are sought from persons or businesses who seek to be Quicken product resellers, where stock is provided on credit. 

The information collected would generally comprise name, address, postal address, telephone, fax and e-mail contact details, as well as the details of the Quicken product that you use. High level information in relation to your business may be also be collected. Should you contact us requiring technical or similar assistance, information relating to your problem and our suggested solutions are also recorded by us to assist in better customer relationship management. 

 How we use this information

We use your personal information in the following ways: 

  * The main purpose for the collection of personal information is so that we can communicate with you about the software product that you use and efficiently manage and administer all products and services we provide to you. These communications could relate to software upgrades, feature variations or enhancements, any particular issues or problems that have been detected within the software and corrective measures that may be taken and informing you of other Quicken products and services, including the availability of specialised, software specific, stationery products. 
  * Identification of software end-users assists Quicken in establishing who is legally permitted to use the various Quicken software applications and therefore assists us in enforcing copyright and intellectual property rights. 
  * In the case of Quicken Advantage, the additional questions we ask in relation to your business assist us in developing a member profile so that future offerings that may be developed for program participants are relevant and appropriately targeted. 
  * In the case of financial information requested from parties wishing to be resellers and, as such, be provided with Quicken software stock on credit terms, this information is used to perform credit referencing and checking.



 Disclosure

With the exception of the final bullet point above (where the information is disclosed to a credit referencing bureau), very little external disclosure of your personal information is made by Quicken. In the event that an external party wishes to communicate with any or all parts of the Quicken user/Advantage member database, and Quicken is agreeable to this communication being sent, we would generally undertake the communication on behalf of the external party (but at their cost) so that access to the personal information of our customer remains with Quicken. Quicken may use, from time to time, external service providers to facilitate communications with its customers, for example a mail house. In these circumstances, Quicken may provide personal contact/address information to the external service provider to enable the communication to be dispatched. Such information is provided to the external service provider on the strict basis that it be used for this purpose only and agreements are put in place to ensure this.
