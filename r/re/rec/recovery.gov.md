# Privacy Policy | Recovery.gov

We at Recovery.gov are committed to protecting the privacy and security of our visitors to this website. Outlined below is our online privacy policy. If you have questions about this policy, please let us know. Contact information is contained at the link at the end of this notice.

**Collection and disclosure of information:** To ensure we are able to communicate effectively with visitors to our web site, we collect some information that can be directly associated with a specific person. We call this "Personal Information," and it includes, by way of illustration, names, addresses, telephone numbers and e-mail addresses. We collect Personal Information from eligible individuals who affirmatively request to receive e-mail or other services from us. We collect this Personal Information in order to provide these eligible individuals with timely information via e-mail regarding events, resources and issues. It is our general policy not to make Personal Information available to anyone other than our employees, staff, and agents.

**Online Comments and Personal Information:** We treat your name, city, state, and any compilations of your comments to national leaders and other individuals participating in our efforts, without disclosing email addresses. We may also make comments along with your city and state available to the press and public online.

Opting out and modifying information: Subscribers to our e-mail list may terminate their subscriptions via a link at the bottom of each email sent from Recovery.gov.

**Information Collected and Stored Automatically**  
When you browse, read pages, or download information on Recovery.gov, we automatically gather and store certain technical information about your visit. This information never identifies who you are. The information we collect and store about your visit is listed below:

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and IP address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you're surfing the web) from which you access our website;
  * The type of browser (such as Firefox, Safari, or Internet Explorer) and operating system (such as Windows, Mac, Unix) used to access our site;
  * The date and time you access our site;
  * The pages you visit; and,
  * If you linked to the Recovery.gov website from another website, the address of that website.



This information is only used to help us make the site more useful for you. With this aggregate data, we learn about the number of visitors to our site and the types of technology our visitors use. We never track or record information about individuals and their visits.

**Cookies:** A cookie is a tiny piece of data stored by a user's browser that helps a web site or service recognize that user's unique computer. You can remove or block cookies by changing the settings of your browser. Session specific cookies may be used on Recovery.gov to improve the user experience and for basic web metrics. These cookies expire in a very short time frame or when a browser window closes and are permitted by current federal guidelines.  


Videos that are visible on Recovery.gov are hosted by third parties that may utilize "persistent cookies." Persistent cookies are used by some third party providers to help maintain the integrity of video statistics. These videos are subject to the Recovery.gov linking policy described below. If you would like to view a video without the use of persistent cookies, a link to download the video file is typically provided just below the video.

**Privacy of our email lists:** As noted above, we maintain e-mail lists to keep interested, eligible individuals informed about important topics, and individuals must affirmatively request to join them. We configure our list server software to refuse to divulge the email addresses of our list subscribers to anyone other than those whom we authorize. However, we are not the author of this software, and are not responsible for any failures in the software to preserve subscriber anonymity.

**Children's privacy:** Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying FTC regulation establish United States federal law that protects the privacy of children using the Internet. We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. Our site is not intended to solicit information of any kind from children under 13. It is possible that by fraud or deception we may receive information pertaining to children under 13. If we are notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will immediately obtain parental consent or otherwise delete the information from our servers.

**Security:** We maintain a variety of physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For example, we use commercially reasonable tools and techniques to protect against unauthorized access to our systems. Also, we restrict access to Personal Information to those who need such access in the course of their duties for us. Your own efforts to protect against unauthorized access play an important role in protecting the security of your personal information. You should be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer, and always log out of any site when viewing personal information.

**Linking:** Recovery.gov may contain links to websites created and maintained by other public and/or private organizations. Recovery.gov provides these links as a service to our users. When users link to an outside website, they are leaving the Recovery.gov site and are subject to the privacy and security policies of the owners/sponsors of the outside website(s). Be sure to review the Recovery.gov linking policy, which is the same as USA.gov [Linking Policy](http://www.usa.gov/About/Linking_Policy.shtml "USA.gov Linking Policy").

Changes to this policy: We will revise or update this policy if our practices change, or as we develop better ways to keep you informed about them. You should refer back to this page often for the latest information and the effective date of any changes. If we decide to change this policy, we will post a new policy on our site and change the date at the bottom. Changes to the policy shall not apply retroactively.
