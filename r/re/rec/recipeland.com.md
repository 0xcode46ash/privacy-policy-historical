**Ordering from RecipeLand.com**   
RecipeLand and our e-commerce partners such as PayPal are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. When ordering products from one of our partner sites, information about you is requested on an order form. The information that is collected from you is used to process orders and provide a more personalized shopping experience.

**Security & Safety**  
To take the worry out of using your credit card to order through the web, PayPal use a Secure Server Technology (SSL), which encrypts your information so that it cannot be read as it travels over the Internet. Which means - the characters are scrambled, making it impossible for a third party to intercept your personal information. 

You can verify that the encryption is working by locating the lock icon at the bottom of the web page. While on a secure page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, as when you are just 'surfing.' All pages within the Marketplace will show the locked icon on the bottom of each page. To learn more about SSL, follow this link to an encryption software authenticator: www.versign.com. 

**Cookies**   
Like most web sites, we use "cookie" technology on our web site. We may place a "cookie" in the browser file of your computer, however the "cookie" itself does not contain any personally identifying information about you. The "cookie" does not track your personal information or provide us with any way to contact you, and the "cookie" does not extract any information off your computer. We use the "cookie" to provide functional information about your browser, allowing us to provide you a better experience. We also use "cookies" to gather broad demographic information and general usage patterns about you and other users of our sites. 

If your browser rejects cookies, you may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that you will be limited from accessing certain areas of our site, such as contests, coupons, MyRecipes Box, shopping list feature, etc. 

**Third Party Advertising**   
We use Burst Media and other third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that might be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, [click here](http://www.burstmedia.com/release/privacy.asp). 

**Third Party Cookies**   
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. 

**Log Files**   
Each time a RecipeLand.com page is requested from your browser, we log your computer's IP address into our log files. Your computer has been pre-assigned a 12-digit number. This number is the IP address. We use your IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track your movements on the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to any other personally identifiable information by RecipeLand.com. RecipeLand.com does not control or monitor whether third parties with web beacons on the RecipeLand.com Web site have the same policy. 

**Other Sites**   
From time to time we may have links to other websites from our site. We do not control, and therefore cannot be responsible for, the collection, use or disclosure of your information by any such third party site. Please carefully review the privacy policy of any third party site that you link to from our site. 

**Security**   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of your information, RecipeLand.com has put into place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to help safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use industry standard security measures called SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.

In addition, you may notify us if you wish to cease the use of any of your information by sending an email request to the same address and we will use reasonable efforts to comply with your request. 

**Our policies may change.**   
By using our Websites, you consent to the collection and use of your information, as described above, by RecipeLand.com.
