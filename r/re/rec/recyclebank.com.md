**13.    Recyclebank Member Rules**

13.1.     These Member Rules (including our Policy on Privacy and Data Protection) govern the collection and use of points and set out the terms of the contract between Recycle Rewards Limited and each Recyclebank member. A member can join the Recyclebank Rewards scheme by registering their account to then earn points by selecting earn opportunities and subsequently participating in recycling and certain other environmentally-conscious activities. If you sign up with Recyclebank you agree to accept these rules. We may refuse an application for any good reason.

13.2.     Our Policy on Privacy and Data Protection and Appendices (which is part of these rules) sets out the information that we will gather on members, how a member earns and redeems points, how this information will be used and who it may be shared with. It is included on the registration page, on certain other materials we publish and is available from us. We will comply with our Privacy statement – every member should read it carefully. Recyclebank does not rent, sell or share Members' Personally Identifiable Information (PII) with any third party without the member's expressed consent. Recyclebank may share certain PII with your local authorities, your haulers and third party agencies without your consent to enable administration and operations of your account. In addition Member’s PII may be transferred by Recyclebank to Recyclebank's affiliates who process the PII on behalf of Recyclebank, as part of the Recyclebank scheme. This may involve transferring the PII outside the UK to such Recyclebank affiliates. If for any reason we need to transfer personal information outside the European Union for a specific purpose, we will ensure that it is treated to UK standards. Non-PII data may be shared by Recyclebank your local authorities, your haulers and third party agencies without your consent. Examples of this type of information are (i.e. non-PII): the frequency with which members recycle, the frequency of their self reporting in the I Recycled programmes and the weight and volume of the materials recycled where available. Recyclebank may also share information about the aggregate volume, or weight, of material recycled; and redemption habits of an aggregation of many households. Weight, participation and volume of materials recycled as part of the Recyclebank scheme are collected by haulers on our behalf. Haulers may use RFID located within recycle bins, boxes or bags to identify which household the bin relates to. We reserve the right to report any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.

**14.    Account Registration & Account Management Conditions: general **

14.1.     All members must have a valid, residential UK address and be over the age of thirteen to register for their personal Recyclebank account and earn points for green-conscious activities.

The member can select whether to receive the PIN by post to their home address or to mobile telephone number they provide.

14.6.     By providing a valid email address during registration a member accepts Recyclebank’s right to send account administration materials to the address given. Your options can be changed at any time by updating your subscription preferences on the website or by calling Recyclebank Customer Care.

14.15.  Members may be contacted from time to time and asked to participate in media opportunities, such as press briefings, interviews or photo calls. There is no obligation to participate and non-participation will not affect this agreement.

14.16.  Rewards should be kept secure, like cash. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorised use of points or any lost or stolen rewards. If the member thinks an unauthorised person has become aware of any security details, password or account number, they should contact Recyclebank Customer Care immediately.

14.17.  We may close any Recyclebank account on which no points have been earned or redeemed within a continuous period of at least six months. We may also, on notifying the member, immediately suspend or terminate the rights of any member, and/or close any relevant Recyclebank account, if they breach these rules, if we reasonably believe that they have dealt with points in a manner not permitted by these rules or any applicable partner's terms and conditions, if there is any theft from or misconduct in connection with us, any partner, if they supply false or misleading information to us or if they are abusive or offensive to any member of our staff. A member can close his/her Recyclebank account at any time by notifying us. If a Recyclebank account is closed everyone's rights to redeem points from that Recyclebank account are lost.

**Account Registration & Account Management Conditions: Home Recycling**

This section covers conditions that relate to members who select the opportunity to earn points for their Home Recycling activity.

1.1.      Only one account per single residential dwelling (house, flat, canal-boat, caravan etc) can earn points for Home Recycling.

1.2.      In households with more than one Recyclebank member the opportunity to earn points for Home Recycling is available to only one of the Recyclebank members within that individual residential dwelling. Please contact Recyclebank Customer Care should the circumstances of the original point earning selection change. Recyclebank may seek confirmation of any change with the original recipient of Home Recycling points for the location. Recyclebank will not enter into any role in a dispute on this matter.

1.3.      For the purposes of earning Home Recycling points Recyclebank assumes the member first selecting this earning opportunity is living at the property and is the acceptable recipient, by any/all other Recyclebank members at the property, for these points. Recyclebank will not enter into any role in a dispute on this matter.

1.4.      Members can link their account to only one residential property for the purpose of earning points for Home Recycling. Please approach Recyclebank Customer Care to discuss individual exceptions.

1.5.      Recyclebank assumes that the tenant(s) of rented property, as the person(s) who generate the recycling collected to earn Home Recycling points, have the right to accrue these points to one personal Recyclebank account. Landlords who believe their circumstances differ should contact Recyclebank to seek clarification but Recyclebank’s decision on the matter will be final and Recyclebank retain the right to refuse registration as set out elsewhere in this policy.

1.6.      Failure by a registered member, participating in any Home Recycling programme, to notify Recyclebank of a residential address changes may result in missed points’ accrual until the correct information has been received by Recyclebank.

1.7.      If any participating Home Recycling household contaminates the recycled materials with any non-recyclable items of any kind, the member accruing points for Home Recycling, will, at Recyclebank’s sole discretion, be subject to forfeiture of Recyclebank Points or dismissal from the programme.

15.1.     Recyclebank has Reward Partners with whom registered members who have selected earning opportunities can redeem points for rewards. Recyclebank rewards points after you participate in an activity which you have previously selected from your account’s list of earn opportunities on the Earn Points area of the website.

Recyclebank Reward Partners are companies and organisations with whom a member can redeem points to obtain goods and services or discounts. These partners may change.

15.2.     Reward Partners determine the particular transactions on which rewards may be redeemed. Recyclebank determines the number of points required. There are a set number of points needed to obtain each individual reward. Each of these will change but in most cases there will be a base offer with further bonus offers that come and go. We cannot control every specific change in the participating companies, their continued trading, or their offers but we will ensure that while the Recyclebank scheme for your area is in operation a range of offers is available.

15.3.     Provided that the account is in good standing, the member may redeem Recyclebank Points for rewards either through the website or by calling Recyclebank Customer Care. Rewards redeemed through Recyclebank Customer Care may, due to increased administration, be subject to alternative redemption pricing than otherwise promoted on recyclebank.com for online redemptions.

15.4.     All rewards are subject to availability. Transactions on which points are redeemed are made directly with the relevant partner and we have no responsibility for the delivery, standard, quality or otherwise of any goods and services received or supplied or the failure of a partner to honour redemption or make a specific Reward available. These transactions and all rewards are subject to all applicable legal rules and the terms and conditions (including booking requirements, cancellation restrictions, return conditions, warranties and limitations of liability) of the Reward Partner.

15.5.     The reward is to be redeemed with the reward partner at the time of purchase and, if all conditions are met, you will be entitled to the specified offer.

15.6.     It is the responsibility of the registered member to ensure the terms and conditions of a reward voucher ordered via the website are read and understood before placing an order. Recyclebank will verbally communicate to the member the terms and conditions of any reward voucher ordered via Recyclebank Customer Care.

15.7.     A paper copy of the member’s relevant reward partners can be requested from Recyclebank Customer Care. Recyclebank reserve the right to charge for issuing paper copies more than three times in a calendar year to an individual member. 

15.8.     Rewards are only valid for the offer specified. Rewards are not valid beyond the expiry date shown. Points will not be refunded for rewards not used by their expiry date.

15.9.     Rewards are not transferable and cannot be exchanged for cash and/or used with any other offer or promotion.

15.10.  No more than one Reward Voucher, unless stated in their specific terms and conditions, can be used in any single transaction. Some offers may be a onetime offer per member. Offers vary from time to time and availability may be highly limited.

15.11.  Rewards are non-refundable. Damaged, defaced or photocopied vouchers will not be accepted.

15.12.  Reward vouchers remain the property of Recycle Rewards Limited. Vouchers are issued by Recyclebank and are subject to the member rules set out at recyclebank.com

15.13.  Reward vouchers sent by post can take up to ten business days to arrive. After this specified delivery period members should notify Recyclebank of any discrepancy in the reward voucher or if a reward order has not been received. Upon receipt of such notification, Recyclebank will investigate, and may, if appropriate correct such discrepancies or replace any non-received reward.

15.14.  Recyclebank is not responsible for replacement of rewards that are not received due to failure to provide accurate delivery information, including address and full name. If a member desires to have Recyclebank re-send rewards returned to Recyclebank as undeliverable, an administrative charge and delivery fee may apply at the discretion of Recyclebank.

15.15.  Recyclebank Points have no expiry date but are lost if the relevant Recyclebank account is closed or the Recyclebank scheme ends. Where points are redeemed for a reward carrying a specified cash discount or benefit, the reward may have an expiry date specified on it and will be subject to any other terms and conditions stated on the reward or otherwise publicised.

15.16.  Redeemed points cannot be used again. If a transaction on which points are issued or redeemed is cancelled, reversed or not completed, we will reverse the associated points movement when instructed by the relevant Reward Partner. If insufficient points are available, or we suspect fraud or misconduct, rewards may be refused or cancelled.

15.17.  Recyclebank Points can only be earned, held, transferred or redeemed as set out in these rules. Any other use, award, sale, exchange or transfer of points, or attempt to do so, is a serious breach of these rules. Any points not earned and held in accordance with these rules will be invalid and cannot be redeemed for rewards. Any such points on a Recyclebank account will be deducted and, if they are redeemed, we will ask the Reward Partner to cancel the relevant rewards and we may take other appropriate action. Points from more than one Recyclebank account cannot be combined to redeem for the same reward. Recyclebank Points have no cash value.

15.18.  In the event that the information relating to a member’s participation in a previously selected earn opportunity has been made known to Recyclebank to be delayed, destroyed or not deliverable, Recyclebank in its sole discretion will award the members accounts a set amount, manually added by Recyclebank Customer Care.

15.19.  The timescale to credit accounts after member’s participation in a previously selected earn opportunity is set out in the appendix for each individual activity. Crediting timeframes can vary depending upon on activity and method of transmission of the completed activity to Recyclebank.

15.20.  The method of calculation of Recyclebank Points will be determined by Recyclebank, in its sole discretion and is subject to change without notice. In the event of primary equipment failure and/or failure in transmission of information to Recyclebank, Recyclebank may, in its sole discretion, use other means to credit an account.
