Privacy Policy

**Commitment - Overview**  


|   
---  
|   |  RecruitMAX.com is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. We want to provide a safe, secure user experience. We will use our best efforts to ensure that the information you submit to us remains private, and is used only for the purposes as set forth herein.   
---|---  
  


**Information About All RecruitMAX.com Visitors**  
  
  
---  
|   |  In general, we gather information about all of our users collectively, such as what areas users visit most frequently and what services users access the most. We only use such data anonymously and in the aggregate. This information helps us determine what is most beneficial for our users, and how we can continually create a better overall experience for you. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate, so that they too may understand how RecruitMAX.com visitors use our site, so they may create a better overall experience for you, as well.   
---|---  
  


**Personal Information**  
  
  
---  
|   |  RecruitMAX.com collects personal information from users on a voluntary basis only. This information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., jobs and resumes). We do not sell our users' personal information, to anyone for any reason. We don't even display it without their permission. When using our applicant tracking system or any other tools including posting jobs and resumes, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display. (We enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information.) All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties, for which RecruitMAX.com is not responsible.   
---|---  
  


**Cookies**  
  
  
---  
|   |  At RecruitMAX.com, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to login repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to login again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer. Third-Party Cookies: In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertisers may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

**Privacy Commitment Changes**  
  
  
---  
|   |  If we decide to change our privacy commitment for RecruitMAX.com, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it to anyone. If, at any time, you have questions or concerns about RecruitMAX.com's privacy commitment, please feel free to email us at [support@RecruitMAX.com](mailto:support@RecruitMAX.com).
