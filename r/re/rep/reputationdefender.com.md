We treat such information confidentially and do not share it with any third parties, except as described above as necessary to perform our services. Such information is maintained in accordance with this Policy.

5\. INFORMATION SECURITY

1\. The security of your personal information is important to us. If you enter sensitive information, such as credit card number and social security number, on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). ReputationDefender is committed to handling your customer information with high standards of information security.

2\. The Personal Information that we collect, and that you provide, is stored by us is and contained behind a “firewall” and only accessible by those who need to know that information and who have special access rights to our production systems. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

3\. We test our security systems regularly and also contract with outside companies to test our security systems and processes. However, no security system is perfect. We do not guarantee or warrant that there will be no unauthorized access to your data.

4\. We will make all reasonable business efforts to protect your information, but no system can prevent all malicious attacks against our system or commonly used Internet protocols or software (e.g., SSL). Please see our technical pages for more information about the security systems used.

5\. The security of your ReputationDefender account also relies on your protection of your ReputationDefender password. You are responsible for maintaining the security of your password. You are solely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You should not share your ReputationDefender password with anyone.

6\. ReputationDefender will never ask you to send your password or other sensitive information to us in an e-mail, though we may ask you to enter this type of information on the Site, which will always have a URL beginning with [www.reputationdefender.com](https://www.reputationdefender.com/). If you receive an email that asks you for your log in information or password, it is not from us and you should not respond.

7\. Any e-mail or other communication requesting your password, asking you to provide sensitive account information via email, or linking to a website with a URL that does not begin with [www.reputationdefender.com](https://www.reputationdefender.com/) should be treated as unauthorized and suspicious and should be reported to ReputationDefender, immediately by emailing [helpdesk@reputationdefender.com](mailto:helpdesk@reputationdefender.com).

8\. If you do share your ReputationDefender password with a third party for any reason, the third party will have access to your account and your personal information, and you may be responsible for actions taken using your password.

9\. If you believe someone else has obtained access to your password, please change it immediately by logging in to your account at [www.reputationdefender.com](https://www.reputationdefender.com/) and changing your Profile settings. If you believe that an unauthorized access has already occurred please report it immediately by emailing [helpdesk@reputationdefender.com](mailto:helpdesk@reputationdefender.com).

10\. ReputationDefender may have access to your password and may use such password to access your account for debugging, quality assurance, or other internal purposes.

### 6\. TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

1\. Technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts are used by ReputationDefender. These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, enabling features on the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Although ReputationDefender uses such technology created by third parties to enable features of its site, ReputationDefender does not share its users’ information with such third parties. We use the information to target users once they leave our site and advertise to them – commonly referred to as remarketing or retargeting. However while third party’s run our ads to those visitors that have particular cookies, they are only displaying ReputationDefender ads based on these cookies. We also partner with a third party to track who visits our site, but this is used for internal purposes and not for purposes of targeting ads.

2\. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Site.

3\. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate the Site. Specifically, we use session cookies to track your session ID and to track whether or not you are logged into the Site. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file. Click here for more information on how to remove persistent cookies.

4\. We set a persistent cookie to store how you came to the Site and what purchase packages and discounts we are able to offer you upon your registration. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance their experience on the Site.

5\. If you reject cookies, you will still be able to view the Site, but your ability to use some areas of the Site, will be limited. You will be unable to log into the Site if you reject cookies.

6\. Some of our business partners (e.g., analytical tracking software providers) use cookies and tracking technologies on their sites. We have no access to or control over these cookies or tracking technologies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies on [www.reputationdefender.com](https://www.reputationdefender.com/) and by ReputationDefender only and does not cover the use of cookies or tracking technologies by any such business partner.

7\. We employ, and our third party advertising partner employs, a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that helps us better manage content on the Site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies and are used to learn about the interactions of our users with the Site and our outbound emails. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ Personal Information . We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.

### 7\. CHOICE AND OPT-OUT

1\. We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your Personal Information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service, but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference in the Site’s account area.

2\. If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication or by emailing us at [helpdesk@reputationdefender.com](mailto:helpdesk@reputationdefender.com). We also offer an opportunity to opt-out of certain communications on the Site, via our user account area.

### 8\. CHANGES TO PRIVACY STATEMENT

1\. If we decide to make material changes to our privacy policy, we will notify you by e-mail through the primary e-mail address specified in your account and/or post those changes to this privacy statement on the Website homepage, prior to the changes taking effect. You are responsible for ensuring we have an up-to-date active and deliverable e-mail address for you.

2\. You are responsible for regularly reviewing the Privacy Statement and related documents. We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Statement at any time.

3\. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of ReputationDefender, with respect to personal information, or your dealings with the Site, you can contact us at [privacy@reputationdefender.com](mailto:privacy@reputationdefender.com), call us at [877-492-0358](tel:+18774920358) or write to:
