We use leading technologies such as (but not limited to) data encryption, firewalls and server authentication to protect the security of your data. Republic Bank’s staff and hired third parties are required to observe our privacy standards and be subjected to audits to ensure compliance.

Please also note that Republic Bank provides financial products and services through its affiliated companies and branches throughout the Caribbean.

When you access or link to another site, please read its privacy statement issued to determine the policies that apply to the information maintained.

If you are a customer of Republic Bank, details of the information we collect and how we use it will also be set out in the terms and conditions of the product or service which you hold. In the event of a conflict between this Privacy Policy and the terms and conditions of your specific product or service, the terms and conditions of your specific product or service will take precedence.

The information we collect about you depends on how you use our websites and may involve the use of "cookies", as explained below.

__**What is a "cookie"?**__  
A cookie is a small text file placed on your computer’s hard drive by our web page server and which we can later access. They are frequently used on websites and you can choose if and how your computer accepts them by configuring your preferences and options in your browser.

**How we use cookies**  
Cookies are used so that we can improve our websites and learn how to provide a better and more customised service for you. We use them for two different purposes:

We allocate a cookie to your internet browser if you visit our websites (including if you visit an unsecured area - such as one which does not require you to log on to the relevant page). The cookie allows us to: 

  * determine if you have previously visited our website
  * identify pages you have accessed and third party websites you have visited



We use certain ‘essential’ cookies to maintain online security and protect against online fraud in relation to the services on our websites such as: 

  * online banking
  * online applications



Even if you say “No” in your browser’s settings to cookies on this website we'll continue to use these 'essential' cookies.  
If you have provided your personal information through the use of our online facilities, such as an online enquiry form or online banking, we would be able identify you from the information provided, and track your browsing activities on our website from the cookie.

We use cookies to make our online services easier to use and help us to understand how people use our websites. For example, amongst other things they will:

  * Make online banking login faster by remembering you between visits on your personal devices
  * Simplify online transactions by remembering the last account you used and showing it as the default for your next transaction
  * Remember relevant information as you browse from page to page saving you from re-entering the same information repeatedly



We also use this type of cookie to understand how visitors use our online services and look for ways to improve them. For example, a cookie might tell us that lots of people give up on an application process at a particular step – so we can try to make that step easier to use.
