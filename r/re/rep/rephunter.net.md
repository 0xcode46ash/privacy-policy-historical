This Privacy Policy covers RepHunter treatment of personally identifiable information that RepHunter collects when you are on the RepHunter site, and when you use RepHunter services. This policy also covers RepHunter treatment of any personally identifiable information that business partners of RepHunter share with RepHunter or that RepHunter may collect on a partner's site.

RepHunter may also receive personally identifiable information from our business partners. When you register with RepHunter, we ask for your name, email address, street address, city, state, zip code, phone, fax, cell phone, and sales-related data.
