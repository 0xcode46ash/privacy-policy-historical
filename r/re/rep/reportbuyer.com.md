# Privacy & Security

The following outlines Report Buyer's policy relating to privacy and security through the website [www.reportbuyer.com](http://www.reportbuyer.com/). Report Buyer is a trading name for Piribo Ltd.

Piribo Limited (Piribo) fully respects your right to privacy and will not collect any personal information about you on this website without your clear permission. Any personal information which you volunteer to Piribo will be treated with the highest standards of security and confidentiality, strictly in accordance with the Data Protection Act, 1998. Piribo does not collect any personal data about you on this website, apart from information which you volunteer (for example by e-mailing us or by using our online forms).

Any personal information you give us through this website may be used by Piribo to keep you informed of changes to our products and services and of special offers that we think might be of interested to you.

### Email address privacy

You have received an email from Piribo if:  
\- your email address is either listed with us as someone who has expressly shared this address for the purpose of receiving information in the future ("opt-in"), or,  
\- you have registered or purchased or otherwise have an existing relationship with us.

Piribo will _never_ sell, rent or loan your email address to anyone without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. Information submitted to us is only available to employees managing this information for purposes of contacting you or sending you emails based on your request for information and to contracted service providers for purposes of providing services relating to our communications with you.

### Postal address privacy

Piribo occasionally sells, rents or loans the postal mailing addresses of customers or registered users to other responsible companies so they can send information about their products and services.

You have the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us. If you no longer wish to receive information from us please email [service@piribo.com](mailto:service@piribo.com)

## Collection of technical details

Technical details in connection with visits to this website are logged by us for statistical purposes. No information is collected that could be used by us to identify website visitors. The technical details logged are confined to the following items:

  * The IP address of the visitor's web server
  * The top-level domain name used (for example: .com, .org, .net)
  * Click stream data which shows the traffic of visitors around this web site (for example pages accessed and documents downloaded)
  * The type of web browser used by the website visitor.



Piribo, and this includes the internet hosting company Redwire Design Limited, will make no attempt to identify individual visitors from the technical details listed above, or to associate the technical details listed above with any individual. It is the strict policy not to disclose such technical information in respect of individual website visitors to any third party unless obliged to disclose such information by a rule of law. The technical information will be used only by Piribo and only for statistical and other administrative purposes. You should note that technical details, which we cannot associate with any identifiable individual, do not constitute "personal data" for the purposes of the Data Protection Act, 1998.

## Links

There are links on the site that will allow you to leave www.piribo.com. These linked third-party sites are not under the control of Piribo and Piribo is not responsible for the contents of any linked site or any link contained in a linked site or any changes or updates to such sites. The inclusion of a link does not imply endorsement by Piribo of the site. You acknowledge and agree that Piribo shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of your reliance on any such content, goods, or services available on or through any such site or resource.

## Security

Piribo takes security very seriously. This site has security measures built in to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of information under our control. Data is protected through physical means and by the use of encryption and firewall technology. Everything submitted to us is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This encryption method is used widely on the Internet to keep information secure. Although we use advanced encryption (Secure Socket Layers), we cannot guarantee the security of the information you transmit to us. Whilst our site is secure, the Internet is not. Where information is captured that may uniquely identify an individual, this information is held in an encrypted manner within our secure database.

If you use a payment card to make a purchase through this site we will never see your credit / debit card details as these will be processed by a third-party: [Secpay Limited](http://www.secpay.co.uk/).
