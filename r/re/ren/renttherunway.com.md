#### Effective Date: 

October 28, 2013. 

  


  


#### Overview

  


Rent the Runway, Inc.(“Rent the Runway”, “we”, or “us) knows that you care how information about you is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, protect, use and share information about you when you use www.renttherunway.com (collectively, the “Website”), as well as any of our services, including applications,, widgets, plug-ins, that we created for the purposes of using the Website or our services (collectively, the “Services”), and whether you access the Website directly or through a third-party website or via one or more of the Services. 

We hope this information increases your confidence in Rent the Runway and enhances your experience with Rent the Runway. Each time that you use the Services, you signify that you agree to be bound by the Terms and Conditions and this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy you must discontinue using the Website and the Services. 

#### Notice of Information We Collect and How We Use It

  


We collect two types of data about individuals: (1) technical data automatically collected from all visitors to the Website, and individuals that use the Services (“Passive Data Collection”) and (2) information that you or others voluntarily submit to us (“User-Submitted Information”). 

“Personal Information,” as used in this Privacy Policy, is information that allows the direct identification of an individual, such as a name or email address, and information that is directly combined with such identifying information. Our primary purpose in collecting Personal Information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We only collect Personal Information about you that we consider necessary for achieving this purpose. 

#### Passive Data Collection

We automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Website. We use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community.

##### Log Files

Like most websites, we automatically receive and record certain information about our users’ behavior on our Website and when using our Services. Our servers automatically gather technical information about our Website traffic and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We aggregate this information with other pieces of information to analyze trends, to administer and improve the Services, to track users’ movements around the Website and to make inventory purchasing decisions that will best serve our customer base. Pages of the Website may also use devices that permit us to count users who have visited those pages and for other related website statistics (for example, recording the popularity of certain website content and verifying system and server integrity).

If we directly combine any information gathered through passive means with Personal Information, we treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Otherwise, we use information collected by passive means in aggregated forms. 

##### Cookies and Clear GIFs

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on the Website and Services. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Rent the Runway only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers or other third-parties.

Cookies we utilize on the Site may include session cookies, persistent cookies, or more advanced technology such as HTML5 or Media Stamp. A session cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's "help" menu. You may configure your browser to prevent cookies from being set on your computer. If you reject cookies your ability to use the Website and Services may be limited and you may not be able to use certain features of the Website, including entering sweepstakes or contests. 

Similar cookies and other technologies are used by our partners, which may also include Flash cookies, which are a form of persistent cookies technically called "Local Shared Objects". Flash cookies are set through a mechanism in Adobe Flash Player. With Flash cookies your data is stored in multiple places and it may be restored once you delete it. Please check with your browser's site on the most updated information on how to delete Flash cookies. HTML5 or Media Stamp technology has a local storage feature that, when used, allows for quicker access to a website upon a return visit. HTML5 is currently supported by some mobile devices and desktop browsers. HTML5 Media Stamp data is not stored in a browser's "cookies" file. 

We also employ a software technology called clear gifs, also referred to as web beacons or pixel tags, that help manage content on the Website by tracking what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. 

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see “Choice / Opt-out” section of this Privacy Policy. 

#### Third Party Advertisers

Third party advertising companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this Website and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. These third party cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. For more information about cookies, web beacons and how to opt out of third party data collection, please see the “Cookies and Clear GIFs” and “Choice/Opt-out” sections of this Privacy Policy.
