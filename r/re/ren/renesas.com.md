| Non-Personal Information  
  | In general, you can visit this Site without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. However we may automatically (i.e., not by registration) collect information that is not personally identifiable to help us provide better customer service. Our service automatically gathers certain information such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to the Site but we do so in ways that keep that information anonymous. This information is aggregated to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and how much of the Site you use, so that we can improve our Site. We do not review information on individuals themselves. Renesas Technology Corporation may use a technology nicknamed "cookies" that indicates how and when pages in the Site are visited, and by how many people. A cookie is an element of data that a website can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your system but does not collect personally identifiable information. You can set your browser to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also set your browser to turn off cookies. If you do so, however, some areas of some sites may not function properly.
