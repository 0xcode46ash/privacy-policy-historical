### Acceptance of Privacy Policy

Each time you access, use, place an order on, or browse the Websites, you signify your acceptance of the then-current Privacy Policy. If you do not accept this Privacy Policy, you are not authorized to use the Websites and must discontinue use of the Websites immediately. If you provide your personal information to Irvine through other aspects of Irvine’s business including offline, Irvine asks you to review this Privacy Policy which also governs information collected through other aspects of Irvine’s business including offline.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Irvine does not own or control, or to people whom Irvine does not employ or manage.

### Collection of Personal Information

The personal information that Irvine collects about you may include without limitation your first and last name, home address, email address, home telephone number, employer name, work address, gender, Social Security number, password, credit or debit card number, or other payment method, billing and shipping information, order history, preferences for products, shopping and entertainment, and financial information that is not otherwise publicly available.

Irvine collects personal information about you whenever you transact business with Irvine, use Irvine's products or services, request information or materials, enter sweepstakes, contests or drawings offered by Irvine, create or update a profile, place orders or make purchases, communicate with us about orders or other questions, or visit the Websites. The collection of this information enables Irvine to provide superior services, to keep you apprised of information and developments that you may find of interest, and to allow Irvine to better understand your needs. For example, personal addresses of residents in Irvine’s apartment communities may be used to inform those residents about Irvine’s retail projects.

When you register to request information on a Website or make purchases on a Website, for example, you submit personal information that allows us to provide information about Irvine that may be of interest to you. Once you register to use these features of the Website, you are not anonymous to us.

Irvine may acquire personal information from vendors that may share the information as permitted in their privacy policies, or from other third parties.

Irvine may combine personal information with information available from other sources (such as offline records or publicly available information). If the combined information permits us to contact you online or offline, we will treat the combined information as personal information.

### Collection of Non-Personal Information

Irvine automatically receives and records non-personal information on our server logs from your browser as well as through other analysis of the Websites. Non-personal information includes without limitation your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, cookie information (as described below), the pages you request, type of computer operating system you use (e.g., Microsoft Windows or Mac OS), the type of browser you use (e.g., Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer), the domain name of the Internet service provider, your activities while visiting the Websites, and the content you accessed.

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your computer. When you visit the Websites, your Web browser may store cookies on your computer, which will better enable you to navigate the Websites upon return. You may use the Websites even if you choose to reject or delete the cookies. Cookies also may be used by some of the Websites for which a link is placed on the Websites.

### Personal Information Use, Sharing and Disclosure

Irvine limits access to personal information about you by Irvine employees and agents to those who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you, administer and process payments, fulfill orders, ship and confirm orders, provide customer service, update account information, post Submissions, inform you of products or services that may be of interest to you, forward updates, announcements, and newsletters, respond to your communications, and communicate with you about the Websites, Communications Services, Submissions and other activities related to the Websites, and you authorize Irvine to transmit email to you concerning these matters.

Any Irvine affiliate that receives your personal information may share it with other Irvine affiliates for any purpose.

Your personal information will be intentionally disclosed to third parties only as follows:

**Disclosures To Third Parties Assisting In Our Operations**

**Disclosures to Third Parties To Provide Information To You About Their Products and Services**   
Except for your credit or debit card number or other payment method, Irvine may provide your personal information to selected third-party entities, businesses or organizations that may review and use that information to send email messages or contact you in other ways to provide other information to you about their products or services that we believe may be of interest to you. These third parties include without limitation residential homebuilders and other businesses. Irvine is not responsible for the collection or maintenance of such information or other practices of such third parties.

Consistent with this Privacy Policy, Irvine may share questions or requests that you send to Irvine, including those that contain personal information, with third-party homebuilders or other parties so that these third parties can contact you to address your inquiries.

**Disclosures Under Special Circumstances**   
Irvine may provide information about you in response to or cooperate with law enforcement, government requests, subpoenas, court orders or legal process; to respond to your requests for customer service or other information; to enforce the Terms of Use; to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or to protect the safety or property of Irvine or others. Irvine also may provide information about you if Irvine believes it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required or permitted by law.

**Major Transactions**   
Each Irvine entity reserves the right to transfer any and all information, including without limitation personal information, to another Irvine affiliate or to a third party or successor in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or disposition of all or any portion of our business or operations (including without limitation in connection with bankruptcy or any similar proceedings).

Irvine is not responsible for the acts and omissions of any third parties.

Irvine cannot guarantee the security of the information on and sent from the Websites. No transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of Irvine to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully.

### Links

On our Websites, you may have the opportunity to follow a link to other sites that may be of interest to you. Irvine endeavors to only link to reputable organizations related to your areas of interest. Because these other sites may not be hosted or controlled by Irvine, however, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of those sites or the content provided thereon. Therefore, the privacy policies with respect to these areas may differ from those applicable to the Websites and we encourage you to review the privacy policies of each of those other sites. This Privacy Policy only applies to information collected and maintained by Irvine.

### Third Party Postings

From time to time certain third parties, such as homebuilders with whom Irvine may have a business relationship, may post information on our Websites. Irvine is not responsible for the content of these postings, or for ensuring that the third parties comply with this Privacy Policy.

### Changes To This Privacy Policy

The Privacy Policy may be revised from time to time as we add new features and services, as laws change, and as industry privacy and security best practices evolve. We display an effective date on the upper left corner of the Privacy Policy so that it will be easier for you to know when there has been a change. Accordingly, you should check the Privacy Policy on a regular basis for the most current privacy practices. Each time you access, use or browse the Websites, you signify your acceptance of the then-current changes to the Privacy Policy applying to your personal information collected by us on and from the effective date of such changes.

Any changes in the Privacy Policy will take effect upon posting and apply only to information collected from you on and after Last Revised date, unless we provide notice or have other communications with you.

### Governing Law

This Privacy Policy shall be governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., without regard to choice of law principles. Those who choose to access the Websites from locations outside of the United States do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable, including without limitation, all applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding the transmission of data exported from the United States or the country in which you reside. Irvine may limit a Website’s availability, in whole or in part, to any person, geographic area or jurisdiction, at any time in its sole discretion.

Personal information collected through the Websites and other aspects of Irvine’s business may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Irvine or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities, and by using the Websites, you expressly consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
