# The Irvine Company - Privacy Policy

  
  
July 26, 2006 

This Policy describes how The Irvine Company LLC and Irvine Community Development Company LLC (collectively "Irvine") treats personal information that Irvine collects and receives from you. Personal information includes information about you, such as your name, address, e-mail address, phone and social security numbers, and financial information, that is not otherwise publicly available.

This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Irvine does not own or control, or to people that Irvine does not employ or manage.

**Information Collection and Use**  
Irvine collects personal information about you whenever you transact business with Irvine, use Irvine's products or services, enter contests or drawings offered by Irvine, or visit Irvine's Web sites. The collection of this information enables Irvine to provide superior service to its clients and customers, to keep you apprised of information and developments that you may find of interest, and to allow Irvine to better understand your needs. 

Irvine will endeavor to securely maintain the personal information it collects. Your personal information will only be intentionally disclosed as follows:

Irvine may share your personal information with certain employees or third-party partners of Irvine or other business entities that have a business purpose to review your information.

Irvine may provide personal information to selected third-party sponsors, businesses or organizations, which may send e-mail messages and/or other information to you. Irvine is not responsible for the collection or maintenance or other practices of such third parties.

Consistent with this Privacy Policy, Irvine may share questions or requests sent to Irvine, including those that contain personal information, with third-party homebuilders or other parties so that these third parties can contact you to address your inquiries. Irvine, however, is not responsible for the collection or maintenance or other practices of such third parties. 

You may request that we not share such information with third-parties by sending us an email at [webmaster@irvinecompany.com](mailto:webmaster@irvinecompany.com) or mailing your request to: 

Webmaster, The Irvine Company  
550 Newport Center Drive, Post Office Box 6370  
Newport Beach, California 92658-6370. 

Irvine will not use or share the personal information provided to us online in ways unrelated to those described above without also providing an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

You have the right to request from The Irvine Company LLC (1) a list of the categories of personal information, such as name, address, e-mail address, and the type of services provided to the customer, that The Irvine Company LLC has disclosed to third parties (including affiliates that are separate legal entities) during the immediately preceding calendar year for the third parties' direct marketing purposes; and (2) the names and addresses of all such third parties. To request the above information, please contact us at: webmaster@irvinecompany.com, or at Webmaster, The Irvine Company, 550 Newport Center Drive, Post Office Box 6370, Newport Beach, California 92658-6370.

If we receive your request at a different mailing address, we will respond within a reasonable period of time, but not to exceed 150 days from the date received. Please note that we are only required to respond to each customer once per calendar year. 

You may also let us know if you prefer that Irvine not share your personal information as described herein. Irvine will not use or share the personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.
