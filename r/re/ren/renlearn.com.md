# Renaissance Learning - Privacy Policy

[Safe Harbor](https://web.archive.org/aboutus/pdf/SafeHarbor9_30_04.pdf)

Renaissance Learning Inc. and its subsidiaries (“RLI”) considers the privacy and security of visitors to our web site to be of paramount importance. We have developed this privacy policy to communicate our commitment to protect information. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in any manner other than that which is disclosed in this policy. Please note that RLI does collect certain information from our users at several different points on our website. If you have any questions about this privacy policy, or other parts to our web site, we can be reached via e-mail at answers@renlearn.com, or you can call us toll-free at (888) 656-2931. RLI reserves the right to revise this privacy policy at any time. Changes to this privacy policy will be posted at this location.

**Personal Information**

As noted above, certain areas of our web site may collect personally identifiable information (“PII”). The information collected usually consists of an individual’s name, address, telephone number, email address, and school or district information. This information is required only when an individual wishes to pursue a business relationship with RLI such as receiving product information, or purchasing products from our online store. This information is collected, and stored in a secure, password-protected database that RLI keeps separate from its corporate web site. RLI will not disclose this PII to any unrelated third party except when a third party is helping us pursue the business relationship initiated by the individual when the individual provided the PII; or when required by law. PII does not include information that is collected anonymously (i.e., without identification of the individual user) or demographic information not connected to an identified individual (See “Non Personal Information” below).

If your PII changes, you may correct that information by sending an e-mail message to [answers@renlearn.com](mailto:answers@renlearn.com?subject=UPDATE) and putting the word “UPDATE” in the subject line of the message.

When a RLI site does collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, the site will either block such users from providing personal information, or will seek to obtain consent from parents for the collection, use and sharing of their children’s personal information. We will not knowingly ask children under the age of 13 to provide more information than is reasonably necessary to provide our services.

Parents can change or revoke the consent choices previously made, and review, edit or request the deletion of their children’s personal information. For example, for the Renaissance Learning Research Panel, parents can email [Research.Panel@renlearn.com](mailto:Research.Panel@renlearn.com) to request any changes on behalf of their children. If we change this privacy statement in a way that expands the collection, use or disclosure of children’s personal information to which a parent has previously consented, the parent will be notified and we will be required to obtain the parent’s additional consent. 

**Communication**

From time-to-time RLI sends out promotional and informational communications relying on PII it has collected. You will have the option of indicating your desire to receive or not receive this type of communication at the time of your provision of such information to RLI.

**Non Personal Information**

Current technology allows for tracking of other information originating from a user’s computer, Internet Service Provider, or another originating network component. This information includes a user’s IP address and domain information, as well as “cookie” information.

With regard to IP address and domain information, RLI uses a specialized computer system to record this data when a user visits our site. This information is only used to provide aggregate statistical information to help us keep the site functional and responsive, and to determine overall visitor usage patterns. This information is not utilized to try and identify specific individuals, however, we reserve the right to do so in cases of actual or suspected abuse of our software applications or web site.

Our web site does use “cookie” information to help provide an enhanced functional system experience to those visiting the site. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Only specific cookie data elements helpful for operation of our site are accessed and utilized. We may use cookie information to determine ways in which our web site can be improved, but no PII is included in such activities, and this information is not shared with any third party. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may still use the site.

**External Links to Other Web Sites**

Users visiting our web site may find links to web sites owned and operated by other organizations. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are moving to another web site. While we reviewed the linked sites at the time of the posting of the link, and only provide a link if we believe the content of a site might be of interest to visitors to our site, the content of those linked sites is the responsibility of the organization actually owning and/or operating the site. RLI is not responsible for, and has no control over, the content or privacy policy of any linked site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any linked site as its privacy policy may differ from RLI’s.
