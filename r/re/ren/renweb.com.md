The primary goal of Wilcomp in collecting personal information from our customers is to assist our customers in managing the information they provide utilizing our products and services.

The following individuals may have access to some or all of your information:

  1. **Employees of the company** : Employees who need such information to conclude a transaction or provide technical support for which the customer has engaged Wilcomp
  2. **Service Providers** : As with any business, other service firms may need access to certain information at very specific times and for very specific reasons. An example might be consultants that must have access to certain client records in order to increase the efficiency of our computer processing systems. We have and will always insist that any such information that needs to be disclosed for any business purpose be considered confidential and not used for any purpose other than the specific business need. That well-understood business policy of confidentiality will be reinforced as needed by contractual agreements with any service provider having access to your data.
