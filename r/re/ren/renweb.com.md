**Access to Customer Information:**

The primary goal of WilComp in collecting personal information from our customers is to assist our customers in managing the information they provide utilizing our products and services. We have always safeguarded the confidentiality of information provided to us by our clients and are bound by our professional standards to continue to maintain this vital aspect of our professional relationship. The following individuals may have access to some or all of your information: 

  1. **Employees of the company** : Employees who need such information to conclude a transaction or provide technical support for which the customer has engaged WilComp 
  2. **Service Providers** : As with any business, other service firms may need access to certain information at very specific times and for very specific reasons. An example might be consultants that must have access to certain client records in order to increase the efficiency of our computer processing systems. We have and will always insist that any such information that needs to be disclosed for any business purpose be considered confidential and not used for any purpose other than the specific business need. That well-understood business policy of confidentiality will be reinforced as needed by contractual agreements with any service provider having access to your data.



WilComp will share the information necessary to deliver products and services that you specifically request to receive but we will limit this information to only what is necessary and required to complete a transaction. WilComp also reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information in order to respond to duly authorized information requests of governmental authorities, where required by law, when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, warrant, subpoenas or similar legal process. _WilComp will not share, trade or sell the personal information of our visitors or customers for use by any business without your consent._
