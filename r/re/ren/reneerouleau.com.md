Set forth below is an explanation of what information Renee Rouleau collects through the services available on our Site, how we use that information, how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect, and a description of the policies we have adopted to help meet your privacy concerns.  
PERSONAL INFORMATION  
Personal information includes your name, address, email address, demographic information, hobbies and activities, product preferences, and the like, which you voluntarily submit to us. The Site uses this information to respond to specific inquiries and requests that you make to our Customer Service Department, provide you with service and support, and maintain the security and integrity of our systems. If you agree, we may use this information to send you product samples, sale coupons, product literature, or new product information. We also collect and store access information related to your account, including email address and password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information. We use this information to open, maintain, administer, and service your account or membership, as well as to process, service, or enforce transactions you make through our Site.  
STATISTICAL USE  
We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, or operational purposes, such as to estimate our audience size, measure aggregate traffic patterns, and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing, and other trends among our guests and customers. From time to time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Renee Rouleau channels, products, and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on the Site. We may use your personal information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping basket" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also, we may share transactional information with entities as necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems. Finally, as our business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets; in such transactions, customer information may be one of the business assets transferred. If Renee Rouleau, its Internet businesses, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred. We may outsource all of these tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. Additionally, any information you have given us about your demographics and personal and product preferences may be aggregated with other information to help us analyze how to better develop, market, and promote our products.  
REMINDER
