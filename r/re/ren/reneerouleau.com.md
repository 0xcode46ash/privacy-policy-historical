Renée Rouleau, Inc. knows that every visitor to our website is concerned about maintaining privacy. Therefore, it is our goal to make each visitor feel secure about accessing and using our website. Set forth below is an explanation of what information Renée Rouleau, Inc. collects through the services available on our web site, reneerouleau.com (the “Site”), how we use that information, how you can opt out of certain uses of information we may collect and a description of the policies we have adopted to help meet your privacy concerns. 

  
First, we collect aggregate information about how many users visit our website and what pages they visit. This information is not personally identifiable. We may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. We use the anonymous browsing information collected automatically by our servers to help administer and improve our Site. In addition, when users request pages on our Site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web. We use this information to evaluate the general interests and preferences of our website visitors. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy. 

  
This is information, such as your name, address, e-mail address, demographic information, hobbies and activities, product preferences, and the like, which you voluntarily submit to us. Customer Service.

We also collect and store access information related to your account including guest name and user password. When you make purchases from our Site, we may collect purchasing information such as product orders, shipping address(es), and credit card information. We use this information to open, maintain, administer and service your account or membership, as well as process, service or enforce transactions you make through our Site. Statistical Use. We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design, operational purposes such as to estimate our audience size; measure aggregate traffic patterns; and understand demographic, customer interest, purchasing and other trends among our guests and customers. Surveys. From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Renée Rouleau, Inc. channels, products and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on reneerouleau.com. Transaction Processing. We may use your Personal Information to create a convenient and easy-to-use shopping process that includes an online "shopping tote" that allows you to track selected products and proceed through purchase. Also we may share transactional information with entities as is necessary to process credit card payments or other purchasing or delivery systems. Business sale. Finally, as Renee Rouleau’s business develops, it may sell or buy corporate assets, and in such transactions customer information may be one of the transferred business assets. If Renée Rouleau, Inc., its Internet businesses, or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, customer information may be one of the assets transferred. Third Party Involvement. We may outsource all of these tasks to third parties on a confidential basis. Additionally, any information you have given us about your demographics and personal and product preferences may be aggregated with other information to help us analyze how to better develop, market, and promote our products.
