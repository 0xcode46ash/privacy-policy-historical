Rentals.com is a technology platform owned and operated by Consumer Source Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of RentPath, LLC (“RentPath”). The rental advertisements and related services accessed on Rentals.com or through its tools, applications or services (“Rentals.com”) are procured and provided by RentPath and its subsidiaries and affiliates (collectively, “Rentals.com” or “we”, “our” or “us”).

#### 1\. Scope

This Privacy Policy describes how we handle your personal information on the Rentals.com website (the “Website”), Rentals.com mobile applications (collectively, the “App”), and on other related sites, tools, applications, or services. By accepting the Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use when you submit a property contact form on Rentals.com, you expressly consent to our collection, storage, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy, including its transfer to and storage on our servers in the United States or elsewhere in the world where RentPath has facilities.

#### 2\. Collection

When you submit a property contact form on the Website we will collect your name and email address. Once you give us your email address or any other personal information, you are not anonymous to us. In most cases, the information we hold about you is collected through Rentals.com, but we may also collect information from private-label, co-branded and affiliate websites and/or from third parties with whom we have entered into an arrangement for such collection, or from their respective tools, applications or services (“Other Sites”). Accordingly, our privacy policy may apply to you even if you do not have an account on our Website. Depending on the services used, we may collect and store the following personal information:

  * personal and contact information such as name, email address, postal address, telephone number and social security number;
  * move-in date and demographic information such as location, gender, age, marital status, occupation, the type of device through which you access the Website and/or App, and other personal and lifestyle information;
  * financial information such as credit card or bank account numbers;
  * additional information we may ask you to send or questions we may ask you to answer to verify your identity (such as your driver’s license, credit card statement, and/or a recent utility bill or other information confirming your address);
  * logs, contact information and other information about the communications between the past, present or potential renters (“Renters”) and the past, present or potential lessors (“Lessors”) using our or our affiliated companies’ communications tools (see Section 5. Communications and Communication Tools; Property Contact Forms below);
  * guest card information, lease terms, lease parties and other transactional information;
  * information automatically collected by cookies and web beacons on your computer;
  * information based on your interactions with Rentals.com or the Other Sites and their advertising, such as search information, computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to, from and within Rentals.com or Other Sites, ad data, IP address and standard web log information; and
  * supplemental information from third parties (for example, if you incur a debt to Rentals.com, we may conduct a credit check by obtaining additional information about you from a credit bureau, as permitted by law).



We may also collect information about your computer or other access device to mitigate risk and for fraud prevention purposes.

#### 3\. Use

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, smooth, efficient, and customized experience. We may use your personal information to:

  * provide the services and customer support you request, including confirming emails related to Rentals.com’s services, reminders and transactions.
  * contact and communicate with Lessors.
  * resolve disputes, collect fees and troubleshoot problems.
  * customize your experience and otherwise measure and improve Rentals.com’s services.
  * send you relevant residential real estate related listings via email, phone, text messaging or push notification on your phone (provided you have not opted out of such communications).
  * deliver targeted marketing, service updates, and promotional offers. (If we use your personal information to market to you, you will be able to opt-out of such communications; see below under Section 5. Communications and Communications Tools and Section 6. Cookies.)
  * make payments to third parties through the Website or the App, should you choose to do so.
  * request your review of a property.
  * compare information for accuracy and verify it with third parties.
  * measure consumer interest in our products and services.
  * summarize your information (including personal information) that you provided to us or our affiliates.

  * enforce our agreements, terms, conditions, and policies, and send you notices and alerts.
  * provide services as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.



#### 4\. Disclosure

We will not sell or rent your personal information to any third parties. We may share some or all of your personal information with:

  * Law enforcement offices, third-party rights owners or others in the good faith belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to enforce our Terms of Use or Privacy Policy; respond to claims that an advertisement, posting or other content violates the rights of a third party; or protect the rights, property or personal safety of our users or the general public.
  * Other third parties whose services you agree to use (e.g., online rent payment services), or with regard to whom you have expressed interest or with whom you initiate communication through Property Contact Forms (See Section 5 Communications and Communications Tools). (The information we disclose in this way will be subject to those third parties’ privacy policies.)
  * Service providers under contract who help with our business operations (such as fraud investigations, bill collection, invoicing, telecommunication and call monitoring services, rewards programs, co-branded credit cards, etc.).
  * Another business entity should we plan to merge with, or sell substantially all our assets to that business entity. (Should such a combination occur, we will require that the new combined entity follow this privacy policy with respect to your personal information. If your personal information will be used contrary to this policy, you will receive prior notice.)



We reserve the right to use in any manner and disclose any non-personal information that we collect including cookie and traffic data. Logs, recordings, and other information related to communication between you and third parties in connection with the services and/or other uses and purposes mentioned herein may be stored, maintained and/or divulged to those third parties by us on an individual basis or in the aggregate. Without limiting the above, in an effort to respect your privacy, we will not otherwise disclose your personal information to law enforcement, other government officials, or other third parties without a subpoena, court order or substantially similar legal procedure, except when we believe in good faith that the disclosure of information is necessary to prevent imminent physical harm or financial loss or to report suspected illegal activity.

#### 5\. Communications and Communication Tools.

Rentals.com communicates with users, and facilitates communications between users, in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:

##### Property Contact Forms

We make tools available that facilitate communications between Renters and Lessors by phone or email. When these tools are used, we may collect certain information related to the communication, like email addresses, contact logs, calling number, call duration, contents of the email communication, and (when notified during the call) call recordings. We may share this information with Lessors so they can manage their communications with Renters, and we will use this information to enforce our rights to collect fees payable by Lessors.

##### Email preferences.

We provide all users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving non-essential (promotional, marketing-related) communications from us. To remove your contact information from Rentals.com lists and newsletters, you can click on the “unsubscribe” link that is included at the bottom of any Rentals.com email you receive.

#### 7\. Third Parties

Except as otherwise expressly included herein, this Privacy Policy addresses only the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. If you disclose your information to others, whether they are Renters and Lessors or other websites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you disclose to them. Rentals.com does not control the privacy policies of third parties. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

Rentals.com has links to other websites that may collect personal information about you. Rentals.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those linked websites.

#### 8\. Security

Your information (other than credit card or bank account information) is stored on our servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must be protected and use many tools (encryption, passwords, physical security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect from Rentals.com. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.

The Website and the App are intended solely for use by persons 13 years of age or older. If you are under the age of 13, you may not use the Website, App or other services, or contribute any information to us.
