# Bausch & Lomb: Privacy Policy

| Bausch & Lomb’s policy is to respect the privacy of visitors to our Web site. This policy describes how we gather information from our site’s visitors and what we do with it.

**How we collect information**

Our Web server automatically recognizes each visitor’s domain name and we collect the domain name of visitors to our Web site for the purposes of system administration. A domain name does not provide us with personally identifiable information. You can visit Bausch.com without revealing any information about yourself. Our site is not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information about you (such as name, address, email address, telephone number and product preferences) unless you voluntarily input this information, such as during a registration or ordering process. Any information you input will be used by us only as described in the "How we use information" section of this statement. We use electronic records to compile statistics about how collectively our visitors interact with our Web site. These statistics contain no personal information and are only used by Bausch & Lomb technical support staff. **By voluntarily providing us with information about yourself, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this policy.**

**How we use information**

The personally identifiable information we collect is used by us for internal purposes such as improving our products, learning about our customers’ needs and contacting consumers for research, informational and marketing purposes. Unless otherwise required by law or if pertinent to a judicial or governmental investigation, it is not shared with other organizations or persons, other than to organizations or persons assisting us in collecting, assembling or processing this information.

Information submitted or provided to Bausch & Lomb by a Web site user or any person or entity regarding Bausch & Lomb or its products, including but not limited to ideas for new products or modifications to existing products, shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Bausch & Lomb shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such information to others without limitation or attribution.
