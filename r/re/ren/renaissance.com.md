# Privacy Policy - About Privacy Policy - Privacy Policy About

Renaissance Learning, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “ **Renaissance** ”) consider the privacy and security of visitors to our website to be of paramount importance. We have developed this privacy policy to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information and non-personal information we receive from users of [www.renaissance.com](http://www.renaissance.com/) and other Renaissance websites where this Privacy Policy appears (collectively, the “ **Site** ”). 

Unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service, accessible at <https://www.renaissance.com/terms-of-use>. 

**Note to Parents of Students who use Renaissance’s Products**

This Privacy Policy applies to this Site and is not related to software applications we may provide to your child’s educational institution ( _e.g._ , Accelerated Reader, STAR 360, etc.). Please note that the collection, input, use, retention, disposal, and disclosure of any private information in our software applications are controlled solely by your child’s educational institution. Renaissance cannot delete, change, or divulge any information from our software applications controlled by your student’s educational institution. For a general overview of Renaissance practices with respect to our Software Applications and the privacy of all student data, refer to the [FAQ document](http://doc.renlearn.com/KMNet/R0057975B6DA9119.pdf). To the extent you have questions regarding the privacy associated with the applications provided by your educational institution, please contact that institution. 

**Information Collected on this Site**

When you access or use the Site, we may collect two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information; and (2) information that is not personally identifiable. Personally identifiable information includes information that identifies you personally, alone or in combination with other information available to us. Examples of personally identifiable information may include an individual's name, address, telephone number, email address, and school or district information.

As part of the standard operation of the Site, you may submit personally identifiable information. For example, when you create an account, you may provide personally identifiable information. In addition, should you attempt to communicate with Renaissance via the Site, email, phone, or response cards, you may provide us with personally identifiable information and we may keep your message, email address, contact information, and other personally identifiable information. At your option, you may provide additional personally identifiable information about yourself. When you visit the Site, however, you are not required to create an account with the Site or provide any personally identifiable information. 

As part of the standard operation of the Site, we also collect non-personal information from you, including your browser type, operating system, IP address and the domain name from which you accessed the Site. In addition, we may collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you visit the Site, the areas or pages of the Site that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the Site, the number of times you return to the Site, the referring web page, pages visited, location, your mobile carrier, device and application ID's and other click-stream data.

We use a variety of third-party service providers to help provide the Site and to help us understand the use of the Site. These third-party service providers may use cookies, web beacons or similar technologies to collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as your IP address. 

**Information Use**

Renaissance Learning does not rent or sell personally identifiable information and non-personally identifiable information to other companies. Instead, we use information collected via the Site in the following ways: 

  * Contact you when necessary;
  * Respond to you regarding information you have requested;
  * Communicate with you regarding Renaissance or the Site;
  * Provide you with customized content and advertising for various products or services;
  * Administer the Site, monitor its usage, and diagnose problems with it;
  * Remember you when you return to the Site, so that you don't have to re-submit information and preferences;
  * Contact you with information and promotional materials and offers from us as well as from our affiliates, partners and other third parties, if you have agreed to receive such communications;
  * Conduct research to improve our content and services; and
  * To protect the security or integrity of the Site and our business.



In addition to the examples above, Renaissance may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to perform some functions including the processing of data. Renaissance may also disclose information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our terms of use and legal notices, as required or permitted by law, or at the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law.

Renaissance may sell, transfer, or otherwise share some or all of its assets, including your personally identifiable information, in connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets or in the event of bankruptcy.

We have the right, but not the obligation, to: (1) retain your personally identifiable information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services or access to or use of the websites; and (2) retain and use your personally identifiable information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements.  **We have the right, but not the obligation, to retain your non-personal information whether your account is active, inactive, or deactivated.**

**Do Not Track**

Certain browsers have settings that allow you to turn on a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature. The Site supports DNT by stopping the collection of information that allows us to tailor content based on your recent visits to the Site and third parties (e.g., Partner) websites. When you enable DNT on your browser, we stop the collection of unique browser cookies that links your browser to visits to this Site and across other websites. If you enable DNT on your browser, however, certain features of the Site may not function properly.

We may from time to time use third-party service providers to track and analyze usage of the Site. The third-party service providers access and use cookie and log information in combination with personally identifiable information, such as name, IP address and email addresses, to assist in tracking the Site. These third- party service providers are granted access to the information via the Site.

Subject to the usage of the third-party service providers discussed above, we do not intentionally or knowingly allow other parties to collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different websites, when you visit the Site, or use any of the services offered on the Site. We do not, however, have control over third parties’ activities, including if a third party accesses information based on your visit to the Site.

**Children’s Personally Identifiable Information**

We do not direct the Site to nor do we knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under 13 (“children’s personally identifiable information”).   **Children under the age of 13 are specifically requested to NOT provide any personally identifiable information through this Site.** If you become aware that a child has provided us with personally identifiable information without parental consent, please contact us at [answers@renaissance.com](mailto:answers@renaissance.com). If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personally identifiable information, we take commercially reasonable steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.

**Cookies**

Like many websites, we may use “cookies” to collect information. A cookie is a small data file that we transfer to your computer’s storage device for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies for two purposes: First, we utilize persistent cookies to save your login information for future logins to the Site. Second, we utilize session ID cookies to enable certain features of the Site, to better understand how you interact with the Site and to monitor aggregate usage by users and web traffic routing on the Site. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted from your computer when you log off from the Site and Service and then close your browser. Third-party advertisers on the Site may also place or read cookies on your browser. You can instruct your browser, by changing its options, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to use all portions of the Site.

**Web Beacons**

We also use “web beacons,” “pixel tags,” “clear GIFs” or similar means (individually or collectively “ **Web Beacons** ”) on our Site. A Web Beacon is an electronic image, often a single pixel, embedded on web pages. Web Beacons are ordinarily not visible to users. Web Beacons allow us to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to generate statistics about how our Site is used.

**Email Lists**

Renaissance maintains email lists to keep interested parties informed about our company, events, products, support, and more. We do not sell the addresses on our list, but we may make information available to specific business partners, sponsors, or service providers. 

Users may voluntarily request to join our mailing lists by signing up or opting in through a form on our Site. To be removed from a Renaissance email and/or mailing list, email [answers@renaissance.com](mailto:answers@renaissance.com) with REMOVE ME in the subject line, or update your email preferences by editing your profile anytime at [www.renaissance.com/emailpreferences](https://web.archive.org/emailpreferences). 

**Changing or Deleting Your Information**

If your personally identifiable information changes, you may correct that information by sending an email message to [answers@renaissance.com](mailto:answers@renaissance.com) and putting the word “UPDATE” in the subject line of the message. If you desire to delete your account, please go to your account and follow the instructions to delete that account.

**Security**

Your personally identifiable information will generally be stored in databases maintained by Renaissance or our service providers. Most of these databases are stored on servers located in the United States. Renaissance may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to store your personally identifiable information, some of which may be outside of the United States.

We have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and administrative steps to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of your personally identifiable information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security. It is your responsibility to maintain the confidentiality of your Site account information.

**International Transfer**

Your information may be transferred to—and maintained on—computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, Renaissance transfers information to the United States and processes it there. Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

**EU Safe Harbor**

Renaissance Learning complies with the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access and enforcement.  To learn more about the Safe Harbor program and to view our certification, please visit our page related to Safe Harbor at [http://www.renaissance.com/Privacy-Policy/Safe-Harbor](https://web.archive.org/Privacy-Policy/Safe-Harbor).

**Links to Other Websites and Services**

Users visiting our website may find links to websites owned and operated by other organizations. Please note that when you click on one of these links, you are moving to another website. While we reviewed the linked sites at the time of the posting of the link, and only provide a link if we believe the content of a site is appropriate and of interest to visitors to our Site, the content of those linked sites is the responsibility of the organization actually owning and/or operating the site. Renaissance is not responsible for, and has no control over, the content or privacy policy of any linked site. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of any linked site as its privacy policy may differ from Renaissance's.

**Changes to Site and Privacy Policy**

We constantly update the features of the Site to better serve you and all our customers, so this policy may also be revised from time to time. Renaissance may modify this policy without advance notice and any modifications are effective when they are posted here. By using the Site, you indicate your understanding and acceptance of the terms of the policy posted at the time of your use. If you have any questions, please contact us at your convenience.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, the practices of the Site, or dealings with the Site or with Renaissance Learning, please send us an email at [answers@renaissance.com](mailto:answers@renaissance.com) or contact us by mail at 2911 Peach Street, Wisconsin Rapids, Wisconsin 54494.
