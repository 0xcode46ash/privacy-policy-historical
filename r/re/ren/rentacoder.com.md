This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ads effectiveness on behalf of Rent A Coder clients and customers. _**The Cookie Principle**_ Rent A Coder uses cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you first come to the site, Rent A Coder assigns a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie."  This cookie is used to maintain your personal settings (...so you only have to choose it once at the beginning of the site, and don't have to choose it over and over).  _**3rd Party Measurement Services**_  
Rent A Coder works with several third parties that serve ads to this site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you.

Often, they will employ a third-party measurement service other than Rent A Coder for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, Rent A Coder has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned.

**Third Party Cookies**

  
In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your browser.

**Closing accounts**

  
At the request of any user, we will close out that user's account, disabling all future use of the account. However, we cannot delete information as we may be legally called upon by a 3rd party to report such information. Examples include (but are not limited to) an FBI investigation, an IRS audit of a user, or a credit card fraud investigation. Exhedra fully cooperates and complies with all government and private regulatory agencies under the law, so if you have an issue with such use of your information, then you should not become a member of this site.
