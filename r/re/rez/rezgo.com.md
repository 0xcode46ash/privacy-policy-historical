Sentias Software Corp. is committed to protecting the privacy of its clients, employees and other individuals served by or providing services to Sentias Software Corp. The proper safeguarding of all personal information collected in the course of Sentias Software Corp.'s day-to-day activities is the cornerstone of this commitment. Personal information is any information that identifies and individual, or by which an individual's identity could be deduced.

Sentias Software Corp. adheres to the principles of the Canadian Standards Association Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information as well as those embodied in applicable privacy legislation to ensure that all information is properly collected, used only for the purpose for which it was collected, and disposed of in a safe and timely manner when it is no longer needed.

## Our Ten Privacy Principles

### 1\. Accountability

Sentias Software Corp. is responsible for maintaining and protecting the personal information under its control. Sentias Software Corp. has appointed a Privacy Officer who is responsible for ensuring Sentias Software Corp.s compliance with its privacy obligations. 

### 2\. Identifying Purposes

Sentias Software Corp. provides numerous services and products to a wide range of clients. Sentias Software Corp. collects personal information in order to provide these services, establish and maintain client lists and records, establish and maintain mailing lists, identify fraud or error, to ensure regulatory compliance, for internal accounting and administration and servicing our relationship with our customers by communicating updates on promotions and services and performing market research.

Sentias Software Corp. also collects personal information from its employees for the purposes of establishing, maintaining or terminating the employment relationship including managing payroll, benefits, employee performance evaluations, making recruitment and selection decisions, and to meet legal, security or regulatory requirements.

Sentias Software Corp. shall identify the purposes for which it is collecting personal information before this information is collected.Â  If Sentias Software Corp. wishes to use personal information for a purpose not contemplated at the time of collection, the individual's consent will be sought in advance.

### 3\. Consent

Individuals shall be informed and their consent obtained for the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information, except where otherwise required or permitted by law. When it is appropriate, the written consent of the individual shall be obtained (i.e. by mail, email or fax). Sometimes, an individuals consent may be obtained verbally or implied through their conduct with Sentias Software Corp. (i.e. if subscribing to a service, consent to collect the personal information necessary to obtain such service will be implied).

As well, Sentias Software Corp. may periodically request written confirmation from an individual that the information collected and maintained by Sentias Software Corp. is up to date and accurate. Sentias Software Corp., at its option, may also ensure that it has continuing consent to use and retain personal information.

Sentias Software Corp. will disclose personal information, without notice and without consent, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

a) cooperate with regulatory bodies and law enforcement officials to conform to obligations imposed by law or statute;  
b) meet an emergency need; or  
c) as required pursuant to an investigation.

Sentias Software Corp. primarily acts in the capacity of an agent and accordingly must disclose personal information to other companies that are involved in providing travel services and products to our clients in which case Sentias Software Corp. will rely upon the express or implied consent discussed above. Companies registered in the United States may be required to provide information under the USA PATRIOT Act H.R. 3162. These third parties are required by Sentias Software Corp. to safeguard the personal information and are not permitted to use it for any other purpose. 

### 4\. Limiting Collection

Sentias Software Corp. shall only collect the personal information that is required to meet the purposes identified by Sentias Software Corp.. Sentias Software Corp. is committed to collecting personal information in a fair, open and lawful manner. For this reason, Sentias Software Corp. does not indiscriminately collect personal information.   


### 5\. Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention

Sentias Software Corp. does not use personal information for purposes other than those for which it was originally collected, unless it has first obtained the consent of the person from whom such information was received. Sentias Software Corp. retains personal information only for as long as it is needed and only for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it was originally collected.   


### 6\. Accuracy

Personal information shall be maintained in as accurate, complete and up-to-date form as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.
