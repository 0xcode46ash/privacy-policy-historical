## Information We Collect:

The information we gather on our sites falls into two categories: (1) information you supply when you register or initiate transactions, and (2) tracking information collected as you navigate through our sites. Third-party providers featured on, or linked to from, our site, such as vendors of products and services offered through our sites, may gather information, as well.

## Personally Identifying Information

Registration Information. To use certain features on our site, we ask you to register. When you register, we collect personally identifying information about you, including your name, mailing address, email address, user name and password. We may also ask for some additional information, such as, hobbies, age, browser type, and the like, but you're free to register without providing this information if you prefer. In addition, at various other points on our sites, we may ask you for personally identifying information, including when you: place an order for products, complete a survey, or report a problem with our site. We use this information to process your orders, to tailor our site to your interests and to make it more useful to you.

Contests and Other Promotions. From time to time, we may offer contests or other promotions involving marketing or advertising partners. If you choose to participate in one of these contests or promotions, you'll have to provide some information about yourself (such as your name, address, and email address). We may share this information with sponsors of the contest or other promotional partners, but we will always identify the other parties involved (for example, in the contest rules) and provide notice that your registration may be disclosed to these parties. We don't control these third parties' privacy practices, and our Privacy Policy does not apply to their collection and use of your information. We urge you to review their privacy policies and learn how they will use your information before participating. If you don't want us to collect the information requested in connection with a promotion, or to provide it to our co-sponsors or partners, please do not participate in the promotion.

## How Your Information Will Be Used:

Our primary goal in collecting information is to provide you with a customized experience when visiting our site and to make our sites more valuable to you.

## Vendors and Service Providers.

We may offer some features (such as chat rooms and email newsletters) in conjunction with third party providers ("Provider Partners") that specialize in operating such services. We share with each of these Provider Partners such information as is necessary to provide you with the services we provide you in conjunction with that Provider Partner. Their use of this information will be subject to the terms of their respective privacy policies, which you can find on their websites. We will not provide your email address to such third parties unless it's necessary to provide the services you have requested, or to allow you to participate in a co-sponsored promotion.

## Sites to Which We Link.

We also may provide links to other websites, and provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we don't control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through our website, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you're visiting or the provider of such products or services. When you provide information in the course of obtaining products or services through our site, use of any information you provide may be governed by the privacy policy of the provider of those products or services, even if it appears that you're on one of our sites throughout the transaction. The provider's privacy policy may differ from ours. If you can't find the privacy policy of any of our providers via a link either from the site's homepage or from the pages on which the products or services are offered, you should contact the provider directly for more information.

## Shopping. 

When you are ready to make a purchase through our site, we will ask you to provide us with certain information, including your contact details (such as your name, address, telephone and email), and your billing information (such as your credit card number and the date that your card expires). We will use the information you provide us to process your transaction and to contact you regarding your purchase if necessary. We will share this information with the relevant merchant to the extent necessary to facilitate your purchase (for purposes such as customer service, verification, fulfillment and billing purposes). 

## Our Other Websites.

When you register for one of our sites, the information that you provide will be added to a centralized Meredith database so that you will simultaneously be registered for our other sites as well. We may share the information that we collect from you with other divisions of Meredith so that we and they can offer you products and services that we may believe may be of interest to you.

## Postal Address Lists.

If you provide us with your postal address, we may include that address in postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties. If you would like us to stop including your postal address in such lists, please send us a letter (which should be addressed to Meredith Corporation, Opt-Out Postal, Attn: Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309), requesting that we remove your postal address from these lists. If we receive such a letter from you, we will act as promptly as possible to remove your postal address from future postal address lists that we sell or rent to third parties.

## Other Disclosures.

We may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law, to enforce our Visitor Agreement, or to protect the rights, property or safety of visitors to our site, the public, or Meredith Corporation. As our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Meredith Corporation, substantially all of our assets, or one or more of our sites (including readymademag.com) is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.

## How to Correct or Update Your Information:

We will always provide you with the ability to access and edit the personally identifying information that you have provided to us through our website. To update this information, please email us at [privacy@readymademag.com](mailto:privacy@readymademag.com).

## Newsletters and Promotions:

## Newsletters.

We may offer you the opportunity to subscribe to email newsletters on various topics that we believe are of interest to our visitors. If you have opted to receive a particular newsletter, you can always unsubscribe later either (1) by following the 'unsubscribe' link located near the bottom of each newsletter.

## Promotional Emails.

If you provide us with your email address, from time to time we may send you emails about ReadyMade products and offers (such as special ReadyMade magazine subscription offers) that we believe may be of interest to you. When you register, you will also be given an opportunity to tell us whether you would like to receive emails about offers from third-party providers. Though we hope that you will find both types of promotional emails helpful (and a great deal), if you decide that you no longer wish to receive either or both types of emails, please email us at [privacy@readymademag.com](mailto:privacy@readymademag.com).

## Security:

The personally identifying information we collect is stored within a database that we control. We use standard, industry-wide procedures such as firewalls and SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption to protect your information. However, as effective as encryption technology is, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our database, nor can we guarantee that information you supply won't be intercepted while being transmitted to us over the Internet. And, of course, any information you include in a message you post to any message board, discussion group, or other public posting area on our sites is available to anyone with Internet access. If you don't want people to know your name or email address, for example, make sure not to include it in any message you post publicly. 

## Miscellaneous:

The Internet is an evolving ecosystem. If we need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in the future, or there is some huge cultural revolution that effects everything, we'll warn you and post the changes before they take effect.

## YOUR CALIFORNIA PRIVACY RIGHTS

(As provided by California Civil Code Section 1798.83)

Under California Civil Code Section 1798.83 — also known as the "Shine the Light" law — California residents have a right to request certain information from each business they patronize regarding that business's disclosures of personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. Generally, if a business has disclosed personal information regarding its California customers to third parties for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year, the business is required to provide, upon request and free of charge, a list of the names and addresses of all such third parties, together with a list of the categories of personal information that was disclosed.

The "Shine The Light" law creates an exception for businesses that adopt and disclose to the public (in their privacy policies) a policy of not sharing personal information for direct marketing purposes without offering their customers choices to prevent such disclosures. These businesses are not obligated to provide the lists described above and may respond to requests from California customers by notifying them of their rights to prevent disclosures of personal information for direct marketing purposes and providing a cost-free means of exercising those rights.

Readymade qualifies for this latter exception. As explained in our Online Privacy Policy, we offer our customers choices to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for the third parties' direct marketing purposes. To prevent such disclosures of your information, please follow the instructions in our "Shine The Light" Customer Notice, which is included below. You can also request a copy of this Notice by emailing us at [privacy@readymademag.com](mailto:privacy@readymademag.com). Please note that we are only required to respond to one request for per California customer during the course of any calendar year and we reserve the right not to respond to requests made by means other than through this email address.

## READYMADE MAGAZINE "SHINE THE LIGHT" CUSTOMER NOTICE

The following options are available to any customers who wish to prevent the disclosure of their personal information to third parties for direct marketing purposes:

## Disclosures of Name and Postal Address Information.

If you subscribe to a magazine published by ReadyMade, or if you otherwise provide us with your name and postal address, we may share this information with other reputable companies that offer products and services that we believe may be of interest to you. To remove your name and postal address from any marketing lists that we sell or rent to third parties, complete the online "opt-out" form or email your name and address to [privacy@readymademag.com](mailto:privacy@readymademag.com). If you prefer to contact us by regular mail, send a postcard or letter including your name and postal address to Meredith Corporation, Opt-out Postal: Attn Circulation, 1716 Locust Street, Des Moines, Iowa 50309.

## Disclosures of Website Registration Information.

When you register to become a member of our website and when you use our sites, you may be invited to sign up to receive special offers from reputable third-party advertisers that we think may be of interest to you. If you choose to register for these offers, we will share your registration information with the advertisers that sponsor the offers you elect to receive. To prevent the disclosure of your registration information to these advertisers, please do not register to receive third-party offers when you sign up for membership and/or use our site.

Many of the third-party offers promoted through our website are brought to our visitors by a third-party agency, CoolSavings.com. When you register to receive one or more offers from advertising clients of CoolSavings.com, your information will be disclosed to CoolSavings.com and CoolSavings.com may use your information and disclose it to its client advertisers subject to its privacy policy at [http://www.coolsavings.com](http://www.coolsavings.com/). If you do not wish to receive third-party offers through CoolSavings.com, please do not register for these offers when you use our websites.

## Disclosures of Sweepstakes and Contest Registration Information.

From time to time, we may offer co-sponsored sweepstakes, contests and other promotions with third-party advertisers and other partners. We may share your registration information with third-parties involved in a co-sponsored promotion, who will always be identified in the promotion materials (for example, in the official rules). If you do not want your registration information to be disclosed to these third-parties, please do not register for any of our co-sponsored promotions.
