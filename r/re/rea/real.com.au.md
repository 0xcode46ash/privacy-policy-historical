**RealNetworks General Privacy Principles**

**RealNetworks and Your Privacy**

Our goal is to give you as much control and information as possible regarding your personal information and the use we make of it in the course of our business. We want to be a leader in providing comprehensive privacy informationto our customers.

With your permission, RealNetworks may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or select third party products. In any case, we do not disclose your personally identifiable information to such third parties. Please see below regarding how our privacy policy applies when you purchase third party products on our Web site.

**RealNetworks Web Site Privacy Statement**

**What Information We Gather and Track**  
There are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web site. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a RealNetworks or third party product from our Web site. When you download the RealPlayer and other products we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address. During this process, you are given the opportunity to decline further e-mail notification of important news and events. In addition, you can remove yourself from the mailing list at any time by going to the following URL: <http://ml.real.com/ml/ml.html>

When you submit an order on-line, your credit card number is submitted to the credit institution for normal, routine processing. RealNetworks does not share credit history or credit card information with other companies or third parties, unless compelled by law or court order to do so. 

RealNetworks uses various methods to collect certain other kinds of information, including: 

Cookies  
Referers  
IP addresses  
System information 

None of these methods can be personally identified with you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web site, as described below. 

RealNetworks' software may use Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs) to notify us of the installation of one of RealNetworks' products. For more information, please see [RealNetworks Consumer Products Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/web/20000519214126id_/http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/software.html).

A "cookie" is an element of data that a Web site like real.com can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. It can be used to provide you with a tailored user experience. Some RealNetworks pages use cookies, and we have recently implemented cookies into RealPlayer (Please see our [Consumer Software Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20000519214126id_/http://www.realnetworks.com/company/privacy/software.html)). Cookies are used to better personalize the content, banners and promotions that you and other users will see. We may use the information to research and understand how our users' habits in the aggregate are similar or different so that we can enhance your experience on RealNetworks' sites and with our products. With your consent, cookies can optionally store information from forms that you fill out on our site so that next time you visit, you do not have to re-enter this information. For example, this would allow you to enter your zip code so that next time you visit, you can automatically see local content from your area. We treat any personally identifiable information with the same confidentiality as when you a purchase something on our Web site. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. RealNetworks does not require that you accept cookies. 

A "referer" is the information passed along by a web browser that references the Web URL you linked from, and is automatically gathered by our Web server. This information is used by RealNetworks to identify broad demographic trends that may be used to provide information tailored to your interests. You will not be personally identified from this information.

IP addresses are used by your computer every time you are connected to the Internet. Your IP address is a number that is used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that data (such as the Web pages you request) can be sent to you. They are automatically gathered by our Web server. RealNetworks will not use your IP address to attempt to identify your personal information. 

System information we gather includes time, type of Web browser being used, the operating system/platform, and CPU speed. This information is sent automatically by your Web browser when you are connected to a Web site and is used by RealNetworks only for broad demographic statistics. This information is used by RealNetworks in identifying broad demographic trends and may be used to provide information appropriate for your computer system. You will not be personally identified from this information.

**What We Do With the Information We Gather and Track**  
The personally identifiable information gathered from the forms you fill out on our Web site is used in one of three ways: 

  1. to provide you with information about products, services, news and events; 
  2. to allow you to purchase and download products; and 
  3. to gather broad demographic information about user trends.



RealNetworks retains the services of certain outside contractors to perform services on our behalf (for example, to ship products that are purchased from our Web site or to help provide technical support services). At times, we must disclose relevant information about our customers to our contractors so they may provide specific services for RealNetworks. RealNetworks requires such contractors to keep your information strictly confidential and to use the information solely on behalf of RealNetworks. For purposes of this Privacy Statement, such contractors are not considered "third parties" and RealNetworks may disclose personally identifiable information to such contractors without additional notice. 

Advertisements displayed on RealNetworks Web sites or embedded in other media content provided by RealNetworks may be delivered via an advertising management service. When you view a web page on our web site that contains advertising provided one of our advertising management services, the advertising service company may place a cookie on your computer if you have enabled cookies. RealNetworks does not provide any of your personally identifiable information to the advertising service without your permission or providing you an opportunity to opt out. You may disable cookies in your browser if you do not wish to receive cookies from advertising servers. Currently, one of our advertising service providers is DoubleClick, Inc.

**What We Do with Information Gathered When You Acquire Third Party Products**  
RealNetworks will never sell, rent or disclose to third parties our users' personally identifiable information collected from the distribution of RealNetworks products or gathered on a RealNetworks Web site. If you purchase a product or service developed or owned by a third party, RealNetworks may provide to the product owner or licensor the same information you provide to us. 

**What Sites This Covers**  
RealNetworks owns and maintains a variety of Web sites as listed above. Each of these sites may have their own mailing lists or other methods of contacting customers. All of the sites follow this privacy statement for gathering information or sharing personally identifiable information with third parties. A list of the sites and the URL you can use for removing yourself from any mailing lists they may maintain is available [here](http://ml.real.com/ml/ml.html). Information collected at LiveConcerts.com is co-owned by RealNetworks and House of Blues; however, it is only located in a RealNetworks database located at the RealNetworks facility. This information is collected and used as described above by RealNetworks. It cannot be used by House of Blues without our permission and may then only be used in the ways described above. 

RealNetworks will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy statement and will take prompt corrective action when it learns of any failure to comply with its privacy statement. Because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, RealNetworks does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy statement. RealNetworks shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy statement.
