**RealNetworks Privacy Principles**  
  
  1. RealNetworks does not share with third parties any personal information you provide in connection with our products, without first obtaining your informed consent. More details. 
  2. RealNetworks maintains controls to provide security over personal information, including credit card details, during and after the purchase process. More details. 
  3. RealNetworks sends you email regarding products and services only if you have indicated you wish to receive email from us. You can remove yourself from our emailing list at any time. More details. 
  4. RealNetworks does not associate your personal information with usage behavior from our products unless we have received your informed consent to do so. More details. 
  5. RealNetworks responds to your privacy questions. You may contact us at [privacy@real.com](mailto:privacy@real.com). 



RealNetworks is constantly innovating and implementing new features in its software products to provide the best possible user experience. Because our software is constantly changing and improving, this policy will continue to evolve as our software evolves. We want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information when we release new products and revise existing products. 

**Scope of This Privacy Policy**  
  
  
RealNetworks owns and maintains a variety of Web sites, including, but not limited to Real.com, Realguide.com, RealNetworks.com, Realstore.com, LiveConcerts.com, Film.com and WebActive.com. Each of these sites may have their own mailing lists or other methods of contacting customers. All of the sites follow this privacy policy for collecting information or sharing personally identifiable information with third parties. Information collected at LiveConcerts.com (a site co-owned by House of Blues) may only be used in the ways described in this policy. 

RealNetworks will use reasonable efforts to comply with this privacy policy and will take prompt corrective action when it learns of any failure to comply with our privacy policy. We customarily release beta versions of our products, which are further refined before the release of the final "Gold" version. Because these products are still in a test phase, we may not always catch an unintended privacy issue despite our efforts to do so. As such, we welcome user feedback on any privacy concerns you may have, and on how to improve our products generally, in all stages of release. In light of the above and because of the complex and constantly changing nature of our technology and business, RealNetworks does not guarantee error-free performance under this privacy policy. RealNetworks shall not be liable for any incidental, consequential or punitive damages relating to this privacy policy. This Privacy Policy shall be governed by the laws of the United States.  
  
**TRUSTe Statement on RN Membership in the TRUSTe Program**

This statement discloses the privacy practices for all RealNetworks Web sites including: REAL.COM, REALNETWORKS.COM, REALSTORE.COM, REALGUIDE.COM, LIVECONCERTS.COM, MUSICNET.COM, FILM.COM, and WEBACTIVE.COM. 

TRUSTe does not certify the behavior or privacy practices of software products such as RealPlayer, RealDownload or RealJukebox. 

TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of fair information practices. Because RealNetworks is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by a third-party auditor at the direction of TRUSTe. These TRUSTe principles apply to personally identifiable information gathered on RealNetworks Web site. This privacy statement will inform all visitors to our Web site regarding: 

    What personally identifiable information we collect/use about you on this Web site 
    What we do with personally identifiable information we collect/use on this Web site 
    Whether any of your personally identifiable information will be shared with any third party
