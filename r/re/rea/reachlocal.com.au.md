**Personal Information**

_Personal Information We May Collect_

 Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home, business, or other physical address, a phone number, and an email address. In general, we only collect Personal Information from our Site users in connection with inquiries about our services through the “Contact” page. Of course, if you send us an email in connection with an inquiry about a job listed on the “Careers” page, we may also store the Personal Information provided in connection with that inquiry. We may transfer your Personal Information to our hosting service providers in the United States of America and other overseas locations for storage purposes. By using our Site you hereby consent to this transfer.

_How We May Use Your Personal Information_

If you provide us with Personal Information, we will not collect that Personal Information unless that information is necessary for our functions or purposes. For example, we may use your Personal Information in order to respond to your questions or requests for information about ReachLocal. We may also use Personal Information to ensure compliance with our policies and applicable law. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the Site or the services provided by ReachLocal, such as service announcements, e-mails related to your account, or similar administrative or transactional messages, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

_With Whom We May Share Your Personal Information_

ReachLocal will not disclose any Personal Information to another party without your consent, unless the disclosure is related to the primary reason for collection or is required or permitted by or under law.  For example, we may sometimes use other businesses to perform certain services for us, such as maintaining the Site and our e-mail services and processing inquiries. We may provide Personal Information to those businesses when that information is necessary for them to complete a requested transaction or otherwise perform their duties. ReachLocal will take reasonable steps to ensure that these third-party service providers are obligated to protect Personal Information on ReachLocal’s behalf. ReachLocal will not sell or share your Personal Information with any unaffiliated third parties for marketing purposes. In the event that ReachLocal or all of its assets are acquired, customer information would be one of the transferred assets.We reserve the right to disclose Personal Information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing that Personal Information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) our rights or property, other visitors, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

**Aggregate Information**

From time to time, we may collect general, non-personal, statistical information about the use of the Site, such as how many visitors visit a specific page on the Site, how long they stay on that page and which hyperlinks, if any, they “click” on. We collect this information through the use of “cookies” and other tracking technologies, which are discussed in greater detail below. We collect this information in order to determine which areas of the Site are most popular and to enhance the Site for visitors. We may group this information into aggregate visitor data in order to describe the use of the Site to our existing or potential business partners, sponsors, advertisers, or other third parties, or in response to a government request.
