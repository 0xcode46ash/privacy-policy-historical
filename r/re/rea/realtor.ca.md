## CREA Privacy Policy

## Privacy Matters

It is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains a privacy policy to protect your personal information on its websites and mobile applications (collectively, hereinafter "website" or "websites").

## Links

This website consists of, and includes links to, many websites including home pages of REALTORSÂ® and real estate Boards and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display this statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy policies of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this website, which do not display this privacy policy. Personal information that you choose to provide to other websites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites. 

## Personal Information

CREA at all times adheres to applicable legal or regulatory requirement(s) concerning the storage and protection of personal information. While CREA is the custodian of the personal information provided to it, it does use third party service providers. Some of these service providers and the databases where they store personal information are located outside of Canada. You should note that where personal information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located. 

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this website, you may communicate extensively with a salesperson or broker. The salesperson or broker may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. CREA also collects the e-mail address provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this website, so we can respond to your questions or suggestions. 

Similar to other commercial websites, our website utilizes a standard technology called "cookies" and web server logs to collect information about how our website is used. Each time a visitor comes to the website, our web server collects only the visitor's domain name or IP address but not the e-mail address. This information may be consolidated into group data, which may be shared on an aggregated basis with research firms and member Boards and Associations. The shared data will not disclose your identity or personal data and will not enable the recipients to contact you. 

The data collected is also used to help CREA analyze the browsing patterns of its visitors in order to improve the content and design of its websites. Personal information will not be sold to any third parties, nor will such information be added to bulk e-mailing lists. 

## Bing Maps

CREA is licensed to use Microsoft's Bing Map on its websites. Visitors to this website should be aware that Microsoft might collect information such as, but not limited to, an end user's IP address, request, time of submission, and results returned to the user, in connection with the use of the embedded Bing Maps. All such information collected will be subject to, and used in accordance with, the data practices described in the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement, which is available at <http://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/fullnotice.aspx>. 

## Surveys

While visiting our website you may be asked to participate in a survey conducted by a third party. If you are selected to participate in this survey, a persistent cookie is stored on your computer's hard drive for 60 days to preclude a new invitation during that time. All surveys are optional and the information collected will not be associated with any personal information. Survey data is used to permit accurate analysis, produce summary reports, and monitor overall trends with our website. 

## Revisions

Any changes to the CREA Privacy Policy will be promptly communicated on this page. Policy changes will not alter how we handle previously submitted personal information.
