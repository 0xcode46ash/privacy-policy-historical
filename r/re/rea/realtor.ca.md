## Third Party Links and Sources of Information

This website consists of, and includes links to, many websites, including: REALTOR® member and real estate Board home pages, social media sites (such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Google and Twitter), map sites, and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display this statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, you should carefully examine the privacy policies of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this website, which do not display this privacy policy. Personal information that you choose to provide to other websites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites.

## Storage and Deletion

CREA at all times adheres to applicable legal or regulatory requirement(s) concerning the storage and protection of personal information. While CREA is the custodian of the personal information provided to it, it does use third party service providers. Some of these service providers and the databases where they store personal information are located outside of Canada. You should note that where personal information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located.

You may delete your website account at any time. Deleting your account will result in the anonymization of your website account personal information except for audit and security purposes.

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this website, you may communicate extensively with a salesperson or broker. The salesperson or broker may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. 

CREA collects the e-mails provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this website, so CREA can respond to your questions or suggestions. CREA also collects e-mails sent through the website, including the "Email a REALTOR®", "Email a Friend", and "Email Office" features, for security purposes, to allow the recipient brokers and salespersons to view your email, to send you communications you have opted-in to receive, and for management of your website account.
