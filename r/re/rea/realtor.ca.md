## CREA Privacy Policy

## Privacy Matters

It is the policy of The Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) that personal information, such as your name, postal and e-mail address or telephone number is private and confidential. Because your privacy is important to us, CREA maintains a privacy policy to protect your personal information on its websites and mobile applications (collectively, hereinafter "website" or "websites").

## Links

This website consists of, and includes links to, many websites including home pages of REALTORS® and real estate Boards, map sites, and, in some cases, Board listing information sites. This privacy policy applies only to those sites which display this statement. While CREA encourages the site operators to comply with these principles, users should carefully examine the privacy policies of sites appearing on, or linking to or from this website, which do not display this privacy policy. Personal information that you choose to provide to other websites will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites. 

## Personal Information

CREA at all times adheres to applicable legal or regulatory requirement(s) concerning the storage and protection of personal information. While CREA is the custodian of the personal information provided to it, it does use third party service providers. Some of these service providers and the databases where they store personal information are located outside of Canada. You should note that where personal information is located outside of Canada, it is subject to the laws of that jurisdiction in which it is located. 

Throughout your use of the real estate services on this website, you may communicate extensively with a salesperson or broker. The salesperson or broker may use your email address and all of the information you submit in order to provide you with guidance, suggestions and service in your efforts to either sell or buy real estate. CREA also collects the e-mail address provided through the "Contact Us" feature of this website, so we can respond to your questions or suggestions and also e-mails sent through the "Email a REALTOR®" and "Email a Friend" features for security purposes.

Each time a visitor comes to the website our web server collects the visitor's domain name or IP address but not their e-mail address.

The shared data will not disclose your personal information and will not enable the recipients to contact you.
