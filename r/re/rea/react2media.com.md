# Privacy Policy

The Web Site delivers promotional incentives (such as coupons, rebates, savings notices, samples and trial offers) using sophisticated database technology on behalf of online and offline companies (our "Clients") to registered consumers ("you", "your" or "Members") of our Web Site. We have created this Privacy Statement in order to ensure your confidence in us during your use of our Web Site, and demonstrate our firm commitment to fair information practices and the protection of your privacy.

### Collection of Your Information

Information Collected to Enroll in the RegReact Program. To set up your RegReact membership, you will need to provide certain contact information. The requested information may include any combination of data such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, phone number, username, and/or password, amongst other contact information requirements. This basic information is required if you wish to enroll on the Web Site. The registration form information requests may change from time to time. We may append additional data we obtain from our other owned web sites or third parties to your enrollment information for analysis and marketing purposes. This information will also allow us to provide better, more relevant offers to you.

### Information Collected During Use of the Web Site

When you select an advertising offer on the Web Site or purchase a subscription or merchandise through the RegReact service from one of our Clients, we will collect certain personal information as well as possibly financial information (such as your credit card number) to permit you to complete your action. This Client-requested information will only be provided to the specific sponsor of that offer, and only if you choose to share your information for that offer. If you have consented to receive e-mails from us, we also collect information relating to your e-mail response data to enable us to provide more timely, relevant offers and products.

### Information Use and Sharing

When you become a RegReact Member, we use your enrollment information and activity data to manage your account. We will not rent, sell or share any personal information we gather from you to third parties except as indicated below or to provide information regarding the products or services you have requested (for example, with your consent we may disclose your personally identifiable information, such as your name and address, to specified third parties that may then send you incentive offers and other promotional materials through the mail or via e-mail). The following describes the ways that your information may be used by us, or may be disclosed in the normal course of business to provide our services.

### Use of Information When You Select an Offer or Purchase a Product/Service

If you are interested in an offer from a Client, we provide you with the opportunity to share some of your contact information with them. The information you submit to Clients is subject to their own privacy policies. For example, you may wish to receive more information directly from a Client via e-mail or postal service, and you can use reply forms at various points on the Web Site to communicate that information to a Client.

### It is strictly your decision to pass such information to any Client

In addition, some offers or services will require us, by their terms, to forward your personal information (such as mailing address for delivery of orders) to a Client so that they can provide the service directly to you. Otherwise, your information is shared with Clients only on an aggregate (non-personally identifiable) basis.

### Use of Information to Notify You About Our Products and Services

We may use your information to inform you of other products or services available from React2Media by making opportunities available to you on our various web sites, by postal mail and, unless you opt out of receiving them, by e-mail. We may also send you offers tailored to your interests, as well as information about us, about our products and services, and about special offers such as sweepstakes or other promotions. Sometimes, we send offers via e-mail to selected groups of members on behalf of our participating merchants. When we do this, we do not give the participating merchants your name and address. If you do not want to receive e-mails we send on behalf of our participating merchants, you may opt out of receiving them as detailed in the Opting Out of Marketing E-mail Messages section below.

### Use of Information About You We Obtain from Third Parties

We may obtain information about you from our partner companies and other third parties in order to provide you with opportunities tailored to your interests. We may also use information obtained from our partner companies and other third parties in conjunction with member account and enrollment information for analytical and audit purposes.

### Sharing Information with Our Business Partners and Service Providers

We may use the personal information that you supply to us and work with other third party businesses to bring selected retail opportunities to our members via direct mail, SMS text messaging, and telemarketing.

### Sharing Information with Our Direct Marketing Partners

From time to time, we may provide your postal information and other relevant data to trusted direct marketing partners who may mail direct marketing material on behalf of us and also use this postal information and other data to market to you on their own behalf.

### Legal Requests/Questionable Activities

We will release or disclose your personal information, including to local, state, or federal law enforcement officials, when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or when required to do so by order of a court or authorized administrative agency.

### Sale/Merger

We will transfer information about you if we are acquired by or merged with another company. We will notify you in accordance with the procedures contained in the Privacy Statement Updates and Web Site Maintenance section of this Privacy Statement if your information will become subject to a different privacy policy.
