# About RealAge - RealAge Privacy Statement

RealAge is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Statement to describe to you our practices regarding the Personal Data we collect from users of our services. 

**A Note to European Union Users**   
We adhere to the United States / European Union Data Protection Safe Harbor Arrangement, which can be located at [ http://www.export.gov/safeharbor](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor) (the "Safe Harbor").   
YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PRIVACY STATEMENT. YOUR PERSONAL DATA MAY BE PROCESSED IN THE COUNTRY IN WHICH IT WAS COLLECTED AND IN THE UNITED STATES. UNITED STATES LAWS REGARDING PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA MAY BE LESS STRINGENT THAN THE LAWS IN YOUR COUNTRY. 

**Types of Data We Collect**   
RealAge collects Personal Data and Anonymous Data from you when you visit our site or when you send us information or communications. "Personal Data" means data that allows someone to identify or contact you, including, for example, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, as well as any information about you that is associated with or linked to any of the foregoing data. "Anonymous Data" means data that is not associated with or linked to your Personal Data; Anonymous Data does not permit the identification of individual persons. We collect Personal Data and Anonymous Data, as described below. 

**Personal Data You Provide to Us**   
We collect Personal Data from you, such as your name, e-mail address, country of residence, zip code or mail code, gender, and/or birth date when you register for a membership with us or when you choose to use the various services we provide on our site (e.g., Tip of the Day, Health Assessments, etc.). We also collect other types of Personal Data that you provide to us voluntarily, such as your health-related information, when you respond to surveys, health assessments, and questionnaires. If you choose to sign up for our pay services, such as _RealAge Magazine_ , we may collect additional financial data from you, including your credit card number, billing address (including street address, city, state, country, and zip code), and phone number. If you provide us feedback regarding our site or services via e-mail, we will collect your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. 

In order to improve our services to you, we may ask you to voluntarily complete confidential surveys. We do not ask you to provide us any personally identifiable data in association with these surveys although we do associate your responses with Personal Data. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, however, simply decline to participate when asked. 

**Personal Data Collected via Technology**   
To make our services more useful to you, we use technological means to collect Personal Data from you, including the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. We also use cookies or clear GIFs to collect Personal Data from you about your use of our site or e-mails we send you. You expressly consent to our use of cookies and clear GIFs when you use our services. 

An "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer Internet access provider, your IP address probably varies from session to session. We track IP addresses solely in conjunction with session cookies to analyze our Web page flow. 

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a Web site sends to your computer’s hard drive while you are viewing a Web site. RealAge uses both session cookies (which expire once you close your Web browser) and persistent cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience on our site. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can disable this function by changing the cookie profile on your computer’s Web browser. If you disable your cookies, however, you will not have access to certain features of our site such as "Remember My Password" or interactive quizzes. RealAge does not store any Personal Data in cookies on your computer (other than the cookie itself). 

"Clear GIFs" are clear electronic images that are used to track your movements on our site. They help us to determine whether content on our site is effective. We also use clear GIFs in HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened and acted upon by recipients (including any persons to which the e-mails have been forwarded). Clear GIFs on our sites collect only a limited set of information including a cookie number, time and date of a page view, and a description of the page on which the clear GIF resides. This information helps us assess the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. 

**Personal Data That We Collect from You About Others**   
If you decide to invite a friend or family member to join RealAge via a Tip of the Day, Health Assessment invitation, or other means in the future, we will collect your name and e-mail address as well as your friend’s or family member’s e-mail address in order to send this e-mail. This information is used once only and is not saved in our database, with the exception of the RealAge Challenge, in which case the friend's e-mail address is stored only for Challenge participation purposes. If you decide to invite a friend or family member to take the RealAge test, we will collect and save the friend’s or family member’s e-mail address into our database, as we would for anyone who registers on the RealAge site. 

**Personal Data Collected by Third Parties**   
Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Privacy Statement, only RealAge collects Personal Data through the services provided solely by RealAge; this Privacy Statement applies only to the use and disclosure of Personal Data that we collect while you use our services. 

We do not use third party advertising services to display advertisements or links on our sites. However, when you click on such advertisements or links, you will leave our site and go to another site. During this process, a third party (including a third party advertising service that may provide services to an advertiser) may collect Personal Data or Anonymous Data from you, such as the URL you just came from, the URL you go to next, your browser type, and your IP address. Our display of advertisements or links to any other company or site is for your convenience and does not signify our endorsement of such company or site (or the contents of the site). We have no control over, we do not review, and our Privacy Statement does not apply to these other companies, sites, or content, or to any collection of data after you click on an advertisement of or link to a third party. 

**Use of Your Data**   
RealAge uses your Personal Data to provide you with a customized Web experience and to provide services to you. Such services include calculating your RealAge, sending RealAge Magazine should you request it (and processing your payment for this Magazine), processing your answers to quizzes to provide you with tailored information regarding your health, and sending electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails to you if you have requested to receive such communications from us (as described below). We also use Personal Data to notify you about updates to our services and to respond to your requests. 

We may create Anonymous Data records from Personal Data by excluding information (such as your name) that make the data personally identifiable to you. We use this Anonymous Data to perform statistical analyses of users’ aggregate behavior so that we may enhance the content of our services and improve site navigation. RealAge reserves the right to use and disclose Anonymous Data to third parties in its discretion. 

If you elect to receive communications from us (as described below), we will periodically send you free newsletters and e-mails that directly promote the use of our site(s) or the purchase of our products or services and may contain advertisements for third parties. As a benefit of becoming a member, you may receive promotional e-mail from RealAge divisions such as DogAge, CatAge, Years Ahead, RealBeauty, MyLifestyleInterests, and others. If you would like to cease receiving these communications from us, you may unsubscribe by visiting those Web pages. 

**Disclosure of Your Personal Data**   
Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, or rent the Personal Data collected from our services to third parties. However, we will share your Personal Data with third parties to charge your credit card (if authorized by you), fill your order, and deliver promotional e-mails. These third parties are required not to use your Personal Data other than to provide the services requested by RealAge. You expressly consent to the sharing of your Personal Data with our contractors and third party service providers for the sole purpose of providing services to you. 

If you send a testimonial or comment to us, we may post it on our site or use it in advertising materials. We will attribute your testimonial to you by posting your first and last initial or your first name and last initial next to your testimonial on our site or advertising materials, if provided. 

Regardless of any choices you make regarding your Personal Data (as described below), RealAge may disclose Personal Data if it believes in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on RealAge; or (b) protect or defend the rights or property of RealAge or users of RealAge services. 

RealAge is a company with either subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under a common control (collectively, “affiliates”). These affiliates include, but are not limited to, DogAge, CatAge, Years Ahead, RealBeauty, and MyLifestyleInterests. We may share some or all of your Personal Data with these affiliates, in which case we will require our affiliates to honor this Privacy Statement. If another company acquires our company or our assets, that company will possess the Personal Data collected by it and us and will assume the rights and obligations regarding your Personal Data as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**Control of Your Personal Data**

**Your Choices Regarding Your Personal Data**   
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use, and sharing of your Personal Data. You may proactively make such choices by visiting [ My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). 

When you become a member of RealAge by registering on our site, we will ask you if you want to receive future communications from us. You may indicate consent to receipt of these communications by checking the box located on the registration form. Should you decide to stop receiving further communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive, or by going to [ My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). If at any time you wish to subscribe to any communications from us, you may visit [My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). Despite your indicated e-mail preferences, we may send you notices of any updates to our Terms of Use or Privacy Statement. 

**Accessing, Reviewing, and Changing Your Personal Data**   
You may change any of your contact information in your account online by visiting [My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). Note that we may retain changed or deleted information in our archives. 

**Security of Your Personal Data**   
RealAge is committed to protecting the security of your Personal Data. We use a variety of industry-standard security technologies and procedures to help protect your Personal Data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. 

On most of our sites, RealAge enables the use of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and Verisign Site ID, the industry leaders in providing secure communication over the Internet. SSL can be engaged by choosing to switch to SSL during any interaction in which you enter Personal Data. We also offer industry-standard secured-server transactions that encrypt your Personal Data when collecting your credit card information for online purchases. To verify that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site connection-identifier. 

RealAge has implemented other industry-standard electronic means of protecting your Personal Data. We store Personal Data behind a computer firewall, a barrier designed to prevent outsiders from accessing our servers. We also require you to enter a password to access your account information. In addition, RealAge protects your Personal Data from unauthorized physical access by storing your Personal Data in a controlled facility. Except as provided elsewhere in this Privacy Statement, RealAge limits access to Personal Data in electronic databases to those persons (including employees and contractors) in RealAge’s organization who have a business need for such access. 

Even though RealAge has taken significant steps to ensure that your Personal Data is not intercepted, accessed, used, or disclosed by unauthorized persons, you should know that RealAge cannot eliminate security risks associated with Personal Data.
