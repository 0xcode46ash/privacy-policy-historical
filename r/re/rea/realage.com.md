# RealAge Privacy Statement

Nothing matters to us as much as your privacy. That's why we make the following guarantees:

Your personally identifying information will always be private. 

  * We will never share your information with anyone. 
  * We will never contact you without your permission. 



**It's that simple.**

  
The information that you enter in the RealAge test and Health Assessments is stored on our servers in a password-protected, personal account. To ensure maximum security, RealAge uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and Verisign Site ID, the industry leaders in providing secure communication over the Internet. The SSL is engaged during any interaction in which you enter personal information. All information is stored behind a secure computer firewall, a barrier that prevents outsiders from accessing our servers. To verify that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site connection-identifier. 

  
"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Web sites often place cookies on your browser to identify return users-this allows for enhanced personalization. RealAge only uses cookies to track page visits for statistical purposes. With your permission, we may utilize cookies to ensure that we deliver relevant information that you have requested. We do not use cookies to determine advertising selections or to deliver information that you have not specifically requested from us. We never use cookies to cross-reference identifying data and we never provide a third party access to RealAge cookie information. Most Web browsers accept cookies automatically. If you would like to disable this function, you must do so by changing the cookie profile in your Web browser.

  
Your password ensures that your account will remain private. To protect your privacy, choose a password that will be difficult for others to guess. 

  
The information that you provide us is an asset of RealAge, Inc. If RealAge, Inc., or all or substantially all of its assets, is acquired, then your information will be one of the assets transferred in the acquisition.

If you have questions, please e-mail us at [info@realage.com](mailto:info@realage.com).
