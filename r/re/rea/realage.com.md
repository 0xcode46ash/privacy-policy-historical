Nothing matters to us as much as your privacy. 

  * We will never share your information with anyone, unless you expressly authorize us to do so to complete a credit card transaction. 
  * We will never contact you without your permission. 



**It's that simple.**

Questions regarding this policy should be directed to [info@RealAge.com](mailto:info@RealAge.com) or we may also be contacted directly at the following address:

**Types of information we collect:**

RealAge collects two types of information when you visit our site: **Personally Identifiable Information** and **Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. We do this to provide you with an efficient and customized Web experience.

**Personally Identifiable Information** is information that can be used to identify or contact you. This is information that lets us know the specifics of who you are. We collect Personally Identifiable Information when you register for membership and when you choose to use the various services that RealAge provides (e.g., Tip of the Day, HealthBytes, Health Assessments, etc.). Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, e-mail address, and identification or contact information. If you choose to send a Tip of the Day or Health Assessment invite to a friend or family member, we may ask you the name and e-mail address of this person so that we may send it. We may collect certain financial information, such as your credit card information, if you are signing up for our pay services such as The RealAge Premium Report. With this information we can fill your service order and better provide you with personalized services. We also collect information (some health-related personal information) you provide voluntarily through responses to surveys, health assessments, and questionnaires.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information** is information that does not identify a specific individual. This information may include the Web site’s Uniform Resource Locator (URL) that you just came from, which URL you go to next, what browser you are using, and your Internet Protocol (IP) address. RealAge may use [cookies or clear GIFs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610193546id_/http%3A//www.realage.com/company_info/privacy.aspx#8) to collect non-personal information about your use of our site, selected sponsor’s sites, or e-mails we send you. RealAge does not store any Personally Identifiable Information in any cookies on your computer.

Your password ensures that your account will remain private. To protect your privacy, choose a password that will be difficult for others to guess.  
  
**Where we collect information and how we use it:**

We collect Personally Identifiable Information to provide our members a customized Web experience. Contact information is used to fill requested services and send promotional e-mails if you choose to receive messages from RealAge. We may perform statistical analyses of aggregate member behavior. This allows us to measure member interest in the various areas of our site for development purposes. Any information we collect is used for our own internal purposes to improve site content, personalize member experience, and improve navigation. We also use Personally Identifiable Information to notify members about site updates and to respond to member-initiated requests. 

We gather information in the following ways: 

  * When you order The RealAge Premium Report, we collect Personally Identifiable Information from you. We will collect and maintain your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, service selections, and credit card number. We collect this and other information in order to fill your order, to communicate with you about your order, and to send you promotional materials, if you choose to receive them. 
  * In order to improve our services to you, we ask some of our members to voluntarily complete surveys, which may be analyzed by an independent third party. Individual survey answers are confidential, and only Non-Personal Identifiable Information is collected and disclosed to third parties. If you do not wish to participate in a survey, simply decline to participate when asked. 
  * We may offer free electronic newsletters and promotional e-mails as a service to our current members and prior members. We may directly send you newsletters and e-mails periodically listing current services or indirectly through our third party service partners. We never send promotional e-mails to you once we have processed your request to unsubscribe. To stop receiving our newsletter or e-mails, go to [My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). 
  * In conjunction with our third party service partners, we make limited use of [cookies and clear GIFs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610193546id_/http%3A//www.realage.com/company_info/privacy.aspx#8) to gather information when you visit our site and when you click-through to our site from a targeted e-mail or newsletter. 
  * If you contact us by telephone, e-mail, or letter, we may keep a record of your contact information, correspondence, or comments. If you report a problem with our site, we may collect such information in a file specific to you. If you provide us feedback through our site, by e-mail or by calling one of our customer service representatives, we may ask for your name and e-mail address in order to send you a reply. 
  * If you request us to send a Tip of the Day or other RealAge message to a friend or family member, we may ask you to provide the name and e-mail address of this person so that we may send him or her the invitation. We store this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time only e-mail. You or the friend or family member may contact us at [info@RealAge.com](mailto:info@RealAge.com) to request the removal of this information from our database. 

  
  
**Who collects your information:**

Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, only we collect your information. This document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. Our third party advertising service partner may collect information about you through the use of [cookies or clear GIFs](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610193546id_/http%3A//www.realage.com/company_info/privacy.aspx#8) when you click on its advertisements, open promotional e-mails or newsletters, or visit our site via a link in a promotional e-mail or newsletter. You should contact our third party advertising service partner directly if you have any questions about its use of the information that it collects.   
  
**With whom the information may be shared:**

Except as otherwise stated in this policy, we do not sell, trade, or rent your Personally Identifiable Information collected on our site to others. Upon your authorization, we will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to third parties to charge your credit card, fill your order, and deliver promotional e-mails. These third parties will not use your Personally Identifiable Information other than to provide the services requested by RealAge. For example, we must release your credit card number to confirm payment. We also share site usage information that we gather from members to our site that have received a targeted promotional campaign with our third party advertising service partner. We do this for the purpose of targeting future campaigns and upgrading member information used in reporting statistics. For this purpose, we and our third party service partners note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of clear GIFs. 

We may provide aggregated statistics about our members, traffic patterns, and related site information to third parties that do not include Personally Identifiable Information. Moreover, we may release account information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms and Conditions or to protect the rights, property, and safety of our users, others, and ourselves. 

In order to comply with the federal "CAN-SPAM Act of 2003," RealAge provides the option of adding your e-mail address to The RealAge Suppression List. The RealAge Suppression List will be made available to RealAge e-mail marketing partners to ensure that you do not receive RealAge solicitations from those partners. For this option, please [go here](https://web.archive.org/web/20040610193546id_/http%3A//www.realage.com/reg/dnsolicit.aspx).

From time to time, we may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide Personally Identifiable Information to the appropriate governmental authorities. We will disclose Personally Identifiable Information upon receipt of a court order or subpoena, or to cooperate with a law enforcement investigation. We fully cooperate with law enforcement agencies in identifying those who use our services for illegal activities. We reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful.  
  
**Updating, correcting, or deleting your Personally Identifiable Information:**

You may change any of your personal information in your account online at any time at [My Account](http://www.realage.com/reg/MyAcntTC.aspx). You may ask us in writing via mail or e-mail at [info@RealAge.com](mailto:info@RealAge.com) to have the information on your account deleted, updated, or corrected. Note that we may retain changed or deleted information for archival or other purposes.  
  
**Collection, use, and distribution of your information:**

We may from time to time send you e-mail or other communications regarding current promotions, surveys, and new additions to our site. You may "opt-out," or unsubscribe, from our newsletters and e-mails by following the unsubscribe instructions stated at the end of any e-mail you receive from us, or by sending an e-mail to [info@RealAge.com.](mailto:info@RealAge.com)  
  
**Security precautions to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of your information:**

The information that you enter in the RealAge test and Health Assessments is stored on our servers in a password-protected, personal account. To ensure maximum security, RealAge uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology and Verisign Site ID, the industry leaders in providing secure communication over the Internet. The SSL is engaged when you choose to switch to SSL during any interaction in which you enter personal information. All information is stored behind a secure computer firewall, a barrier that prevents outsiders from accessing our servers. To verify that you have a secure server connection, look for the locked padlock symbol at the bottom of your browser window or the HTMLS-code in the site connection-identifier.

In order to serve you as efficiently as possible, established third party banking institutions, process agents, and distribution institutions handle credit card transactions. They receive the information they need to verify and authorize your credit card transactions. When collecting credit card information for online purchases, we offer secured-server transactions that encrypt your information in transit to thwart someone from intercepting and misusing it. When you access your account information, the information is kept on a secure server. Furthermore, all of the member data we collect is protected against unauthorized access by physical security means. 

Your password ensures that your account will remain private. To protect your privacy, choose a password that will be difficult for others to guess.  
  
**Cookies and clear GIFs:**

" **Cookies** " are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Web sites often place cookies on your browser to identify return users -- this allows for enhanced personalization. RealAge only uses cookies to streamline the interactive experience. With your permission, we may utilize cookies to ensure that we deliver relevant information that you have requested. We do not use cookies to determine advertising selections or to deliver information that you have not specifically requested from us. We never use cookies to cross-reference identifying data and we never provide a third party access to RealAge cookie information. Most Web browsers accept cookies automatically. If you would like to disable this function, you must do so by changing the cookie profile in your computer’s Web browser. If you disable your cookies, you will not have access to any interactive quizzes at RealAge.

**Clear GIFs** are tiny graphics with a unique identifier -- similar in function to cookies -- and are used to track the online movements of our members. The main difference between the two is that clear GIFs are invisible on the page and are much smaller, about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Clear GIFs are not tied to your Personally Identifiable Information. Clear GIFs help us better manage content on our site by informing us of what content is most effective. Our third party service partners use clear GIFs in HTML-based e-mails to let us know which e-mails have been opened by recipients, to track the visitor traffic on our site, and assess the effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns.  
  
**Children, parental consent, and privacy:**

The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act took effect on April 21, 2000. It imposes certain requirements on Web sites specifically directed toward children under 13 that collect information on those children. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. RealAge is not designed or intended to attract children under the age of 18. We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information from any person we actually know is under the age of 18.  
  
**Third party Web sites accessible from our site:**

Other sites accessible through our site have their own privacy policies, as well as data collection, use, and disclosure practices. Please consult each site's privacy policy. We are not responsible for the policies or practices of third parties. Please be aware that our site may contain links to other sites on the Internet that are owned and operated by third parties. The information practices of those Web sites linked to our site are not covered by RealAge’s privacy policy.   
  
**Business transfers:**

The information that you provide us is an asset of RealAge, Inc. If RealAge, Inc., all, or substantially all, of its assets is acquired, then your information will be one of the assets transferred in the acquisition.  
  
**Contacting us about privacy questions or concerns:**

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact us by sending an e-mail to [info@RealAge.com](mailto:info@RealAge.com) or contact us directly at:
