The following data privacy provisions govern the use of the services and features offered by EYZ Media GbR, Köpenicker Str. 154 in D-10997 Berlin (herein referred to as ‘EYZ’) at http://www.realeyz.tv :

1\. EYZ respects the privacy of users and has made the protection of user privacy on its internet website an utmost priority. This means that we are continually committed to treating any personal information submitted to us by users with great care. This especially holds true in any collaboration with third parties and partner organizations. EYZ does not, however, assume liability for third parties unless otherwise individually and specifically declared. 

2\. EYZ collects, stores, and processes personal information exclusively in accordance with currently valid legal regulations and to fulfill the contractual relationship between EYZ and the user, for example, when it is necessary and relevant to providing the services and features requested by the user. 

All particulars the user submits to EYZ internet website, especially during the registration process, are considered personal information. 

3\. In addition, we use what is known as “cookies” (small packages of data that transmit system configuration data, such as screen resolution and IP address) to improve the services and products we offer. It is possible, however, to disable cookies storage by changing the settings on your browser (further details on browser settings can be found in the browser menu option: “extras – internet options”, in the browser toolbar.)

Furthermore, this website uses Google Analytics, a Google Inc. (hereafter “Google”) web analysis service. Google Analytics uses what is known as “cookies”. Cookies are text files saved to the user's computer that permit the service provider to analyze the user's use of the website. The information about the use of this website by the user (including IP address) that is gathered by the cookie is transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google uses this information in order to evaluate the use of the website, to compile reports for the website's operators, and to provide additional services related to website and internet usage. Where applicable, Google will also pass on this information to third parties if required to do so by law, or insofar as third parties process this information on Google's behalf. Under no circumstances will Google relate the user's IP address to other Google data. The user can prevent the installation of these cookies by configuring the corresponding browser software. We would like to point out however that in doing so, not all of the website's features will be fully functional. By using this website, the user agrees to allow Google to process the information that has been compiled about him or her, in the manner and for the uses specified above. 

4\. The user understands that his or her personal information may be transferred to third parties if this information is relevant and necessary to fulfilling the contractual agreement between EYZ and the user, and to provide and optimize the features and functionality of requested services. Any further usage that goes beyond the aforementioned, in particular transferring or selling such data to third parties by EYZ is prohibited, unless the user has expressly consented to such use. 

5\. Furthermore, EYZ is authorized to send users occasional advertising by email or postage mail unless requested otherwise. This includes the mailing of a regularly published newsletter. 

6\. Any user can disallow the use of personal information for advertising purposes without stating grounds by sending an email to [privacy@realeyz.tv](mailto:privacy@realeyz.tv) Further information on how to unsubscribe can be found in all emails.

If this is the case, or if you have questions, concerns or other requests, please contact us at [privacy@realeyz.tv](mailto:privacy@realeyz.tv). Implementation of this may, however, prevent EYZ from fulfilling its contractual obligations. Should this be the case, the contractual agreement between EYZ and the user shall be terminated.
