# ReachMail - Privacy Policy

ReachMail is committed to the highest standards of Privacy and maintains a strict Anti-Spam policy. 

If you have had trouble removing yourself from a list sent via ReachMail using the opt-out link provided in the email, please FORWARD the message directly to rem@reachmail.com and we will promptly remove you. The email must be forwarded, otherwise we will not know from which mailing list it originated. If you no longer have this email, please provide as much detail as possible, so we can identify the source of the mailing.

We do not tolerate spam and refuse to work with clients who blatantly send messages to recipients who have not clearly expressed an interest in receiving emails from our clients. We take issues of email abuse very seriously. If you feel that you have been subjected to spam sent using ReachMail's services, please email abuse@reachmail.com and we will investigate the matter promptly, including the complete removal of your name from the client(s) lists in question.

There is no issue of greater importance than user privacy. Since personal privacy integrity is at the very core of our business, ReachMail's success depends implicitly upon its ability to maintain the trust of the people viewing mail sent from our clients.

ReachMail complies with the US-EU Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the US Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries. ReachMail has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view our certification page, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>

In compliance with the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles, ReachMail commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. European Union citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact ReachMail at:

ReachMail Inc.  
Attn: John Murphy  
Privacy Manager

Suite 1427  
Chicago, IL 60604

P. 312-229-0110

ReachMail has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed by ReachMail, please visit the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR web site at [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](http://www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint.

## Client Data Policy

As our client, you have exclusive ownership and rights to your subscriber data. Your subscriber data will never be shared with any third-parties. Other ReachMail users do not have access to your data. ReachMail support staff may access your data during support requests or from time to time during account audits. ReachMail support staff will never modify your data except at your written request. 

## Email Recipient Policy

Email is sent only to lists that have been warranted to us to be composed of opted-in subscribers of our clients. Any e-mail recipient may request at any time to be removed from those lists, and we will comply with that request within one business day. In addition, we will thoroughly investigate any allegations made by e-mail recipients relating to unsolicited e-mail.

## Subscriber Privacy

Data Collection: ReachMail allows customers to collect subscriber data only if that data is collected using legitimate opt-in methodsâ€”that is, the recipient actively entered their email into the customer's sign-up form, or the email came from an existing customer database.  
Use of purchased lists is prohibited.  
Confirmed Opt-In Process: When we host the subscription process for a client, this process is a confirmed opt-in. This means that after a person requests becoming a subscriber initially, they will receive a confirmation that they must respond to in order for a subscription to become valid.

## Anti-Spam Statement

Spam is jeopardizing the future of email marketing and we are adamantly opposed to the practice of sending spam. ReachMail practices permission-based e-marketing techniques and does not send spam or work with companies who do so.

## Abuse

Any individual or client who is suspected of abusing ReachMail services may be canceled at anytime. There will be no refunds to any monies paid for services. Abuse can be measured by subscriber feedback or by ReachMail's own internal auditing methods.

## Security Statement

Along with privacy, security is of utmost importance at ReachMail. Therefore, substantial investments have been made in ReachMail's technology platform including high-end servers and hosting, database applications, and security technologies.
