# ReadyTalk - Privacy Policy

ReadyTalk is a leading provider of audio and web conferencing services. We have developed this site (the "ReadyTalk Site") to provide you with information about our services as well as to provide a means to access these services. We understand your need for privacy when using the Internet for your communication. This policy discloses ReadyTalks practices with respect to the collection, use and disclosure of user information collected through the ReadyTalk web site and through your use of our services.

## Policies

**1\. NOTICE.** We will ask you to provide us with information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you (" **Personal Information** ") when, among other things, you register on the ReadyTalk Site, use one of our services, fill out a survey, make a request for information, or enter a sweepstakes or contest through the ReadyTalk Site. We will use the Personal Information that you provide us in these circumstances to operate the ReadyTalk Site, to provision, deliver, bill and collect for services as well as provide information that you request from the ReadyTalk Site (" **Primary Use** "). 

Unless you instruct us not to do so, ReadyTalk may also use the Personal Information that you provide us to contact you regarding additional or new services and features offered by ReadyTalk, special offers by ReadyTalk, or important information regarding ReadyTalk (" **ReadyTalk Secondary Use** "). We will not provide your Personal Information to other companies who may contact you regarding products, services, and offers that may be of interest to you, but that are not directly related to ReadyTalk or the ReadyTalk Site (" **Third Party Secondary Use** "). 

**2\. CHOICE**. You may stop the delivery of informational or promotional mail from us by following the instructions included in the informational or promotional mail itself. 

**3\. ACCESS.** When you register to use any of the services offered by ReadyTalk, ReadyTalk will send you a confirmation of your registration showing the Personal Information that we obtained from your registration. Also, whenever possible, we will take reasonable steps to give you the opportunity to confirm and/or modify your Personal Information. 

**4\. SECURITY.** The Personal Information that we collect from you is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the general public. In the case of credit card numbers and other financial information, your Personal Information is encrypted for even greater protection. However, the other sites that you may access through the ReadyTalk Site may have different security practices and you should familiarize yourself with those practices. 

**5\. COMPLAINTS.** If at any time you believe that we have violated any of these Policies, please notify us by email at [ ](mailto:%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%3C!--var%20prefix%20=%20'ma'%20+%20'il'%20+%20'to';var%20path%20=%20'hr'%20+%20'ef'%20+%20'=';var%20addy26947%20=%20'info'%20+%20'@';addy26947%20=%20addy26947%20+%20'readytalk'%20+%20'.'%20+%20'com';document.write\(%20'%3Ca%20'%20+%20path%20+%20'\\''%20+%20prefix%20+%20':'%20+%20addy26947%20+%20'\\'%3E'%20\);document.write\(%20addy26947%20\);document.write\(%20'%3C\\/a%3E'%20\);//--%3E\\n%20%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%3C!--document.write\(%20'%3Cspan%20style=\\'display:%20none;\\'%3E'%20\);//--%3E%3C/script%3EThis%20email%20address%20is%20being%20protected%20from%20spam%20bots,%20you%20need%20Javascript%20enabled%20to%20view%20it%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%3C!--document.write\(%20'%3C/'%20\);document.write\(%20'span%3E'%20\);//--%3E\\n%20%3C/script%3E%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%3C!--document.write\(%20'%3Cspan%20style=\\'display:%20none;\\'%3E'%20\);//--%3E%3C/script%3EThis%20email%20address%20is%20being%20protected%20from%20spam%20bots,%20you%20need%20Javascript%20enabled%20to%20view%20it%3Cscript%20language='JavaScript'%20type='text/javascript'%3E%3C!--document.write\(%20'%3C/'%20\);document.write\(%20'span%3E'%20\);//--%3E%3C/script%3E)[info@readytalk.com](mailto:info@readytalk.com) and we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to promptly investigate and remedy the problem.

**6\. DISCLOSURE FOR LEGAL PURPOSES.** We may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary: (a) to conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates, (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users, (c) to act immediately to protect the personal safety of our users or the public, or (d) in connection with a merger, consolidation or sale of substantial assets of ReadyTalk. As we continue to develop our business, we might buy or sell assets related to our business. In such transactions Personal Information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that ReadyTalk or substantially all of its assets are acquired, Personal Information will be one of the transferred assets. 

**7\. ANONYMOUS INFORMATION.** Please understand that, in addition to collecting Personal Information, ReadyTalk may also gather information that does not personally identify you regarding your use of the ReadyTalk Site (" **Anonymous Information** "). The Anonymous Information that we collect regarding your use of the ReadyTalk Site may be used by us to measure the effectiveness of marketing efforts on the ReadyTalk Site, for improving the services we offer to you, or to share with third parties for other purposes. For example, we might use this Anonymous Information to inform our advertisers how many users visited a particular advertisement, and for how long, so they can measure whether the advertisement was effective. Generally, you will not be aware when such Anonymous Information is being collected about you - it may be collected in various ways, such as through traffic data or direct surveys of our customers and may entail the use of, among other things, cookies, IP addresses, or other numeric codes used to identify a computer by which a user accesses our site or used to identify other devices by which a user may access our services. 

**8\. COOKIES.** We may use cookies to provide you with better service. Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make the Web more useful by storing information about your preferences for a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major Web sites use them to provide useful features for their customers. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, you may not be able to take full advantage of the functionality of the ReadyTalk Site or services if you do so. 

**9\. VENTURING OFF THE READYTALK SITE.** The ReadyTalk Site may contain ad banners and hyperlinks that can take you to Web sites run by other third parties ("Third-Party Sites"). ReadyTalk has no control over how such Third-Party Sites will treat your Personal Information, and the terms of the privacy policies of such Third-Party Sites may differ from the terms of this Privacy Policy. Accordingly, ReadyTalk strongly recommends that you review the terms of the privacy policy at each Third-Party Site that you choose to visit before providing any Personal Information to that site. 

**Remember, this Privacy Policy only applies to the ReadyTalk site. When you are no longer on the ReadyTalk site, you may encounter different privacy and security practices and you should familiarize yourself with those practices each time you visit a new site.**
