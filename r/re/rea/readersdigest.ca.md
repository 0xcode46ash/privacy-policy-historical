# Reader's Digest Canada - Privacy Policy

**Privacy Policy**

In over 75 years in the Direct Marketing business, Reader's Digest has adhered to the highest standards in assuring our customers' privacy. All information -- including customer accounts, transactions, and all correspondence, are handled with the utmost discretion. 

The policies below are applicable to www.readersdigest.ca, owned and operated by The Reader's Digest Association (Canada) Ltd., unless otherwise indicated. 

**Collection of Personal Information**  
The only personal information collected by Reader's Digest through our web sites is information which is submitted to us voluntarily and knowingly by site visitors. When you simply browse our site, no personal information is being collected by Reader's Digest. 

Some functions and services offered through our site require that you provide certain personal information, for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list, we may need your postal or e-mail address. 

  
**Receiving E-mail and Postal Correspondence**  
By submitting a form on this site you will be entitled to receive e-mail correspondence from Reader's Digest. This e-mail correspondence may include opportunities to enter sweepstakes as well as subscriber-only special offers, including discounts, free gifts, and opportunities to win cash and prizes. You may opt out of being included in our mailing list by updating your communications preferences by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203212633id_/http%3A//www.readersdigest.ca/comm_prefs.html). Our purpose is to provide visitors with useful information and offers that will interest them. Every e-mail we send out will include an explanation on how to opt-out from receiving future e-mail correspondence. 

Reader's Digest will not share e-mail addresses we collect through our web sites with any unaffiliated third parties unless we specify at the point of collection. Occasionally, Reader's Digest may make names and postal addresses we collect through our web sites available to reputable companies whose products and/or services may interest you unless you opt out of being included in our postal mailing list. 

Reader's Digest may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties for statistical analysis, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information. 

  
**Opting Out**  
Receiving e-mail messages from Reader's Digest is optional. You may choose not to receive e-mail, even after granting prior permission, or you may wish to correct information you previously provided. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or wish to correct information you provided to Reader's Digest, please [click here](https://web.archive.org/web/20031203212633id_/http%3A//www.readersdigest.ca/comm_prefs.html) to go to the Communications Preferences Form. 

Reader's Digest will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our database when we receive requests to do so; however because of possible retention of a residual copy in a system backup file, we cannot guarantee deletion in every instance. 

If you prefer not to receive postal mailings from Reader's Digest or from reputable companies we may share your name and postal address with, write to us at the address below.

**Hyperlinks to Other Web Sites**  
Reader's Digest web sites may include links to web sites of other companies unaffiliated with Reader's Digest. Please note that we are unable to review all such sites and take no responsibility for the content of any unaffiliated web site. 

  
**Cookies and Server Logs**  
Reader's Digest, related web hosting providers, and advertisers sometimes utilize "cookie" technology. Cookies are bits of data stored on your local hard drive which help enhance your web browsing experience. Not all web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting which allow to refuse cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may not be able to fully participate in all our web sites' features, including registration and entry into contests, prize draws and sweepstakes. 

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user's ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is used in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors' web browsing systems. 

  
**Credit Cards**  
Reader's Digest uses credit card numbers submitted to us through our web sites for payment purposes only, and not for marketing purposes. We utilize industry standard secure encryption technology to reasonably assure the privacy and security of the credit card numbers of anyone who places online orders with us.
