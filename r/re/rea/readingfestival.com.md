### The Green Tent Company from£15

Here at ReadingFestival we are very excited to announce the arrival of THE GREEN TENT COMPANY.

Each year we are faced with the mammoth task of cleaning up the fields which are usually strewn with huge amounts of used camping equipment including TENTS, SLEEPING BAGS and CAMPING MATS. 

Until now we have only been able to work with charities in the main to collect good equipment and a vast majority of the remainder end up going straight to LANDFILL because a traditional tent is made up of many different components such as FIBRE GLASS POLES, NYLON ZIPS and METAL PEGS which makes them un-economical to separate for recycling.

Their ground breaking range starts with a 2 man dome tent and is topped by a deluxe 6 man, 3 bedroom version which is tall enough to stand up in.They have even manufactured their SLEEPING BAGS and CAMPING MATS from the same single product making them more festival friendly. 

So if you’re going to be purchasing a new tent for this year’s Reading festival please visit [www.thegreententcompany.co.uk](http://www.thegreententcompany.co.uk/festivalchoose.asp?mychosenfestival=5) and help us to reduce our carbon footprint, thus SAVING THE PLANET.
