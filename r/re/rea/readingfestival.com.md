# Privacy Policy | Reading Festival

This Policy explains what _personal information_ _Festival Republic and its group_ (known in this Policy as “ **we** ” or “ **Festival Republic** ”) _collect_ both online (including through apps) and offline and _how we use it_. Please read it carefully. ** __**

Generally, we collect information about you if you register on our website or create an account, when you email or call us and when you use our websites, apps and social media. We use that and other information to provide better services, marketing and support to you and our other customers (including by analysing your information to provide you with a personalised experience).

When you, for example, register or create an account, download one of our apps or contact us on the phone, we may ask your consent to use your information for certain purposes. Your choices about how we use information are described _here_.

As an organiser and promoter of festivals and events, Festival Republic works with third parties such as artists, agents, venues, sponsors and ticketing agents. We refer to these artists, agents, venues, sponsors or ticketing agents who we work with in order to provide festivals and events as our " **Event Partners** ". We will share your information with our Event Partners and may share your information with other third parties, as further described _here_.

Festival Republic is a data controller (i.e. a person responsible for the processing of your personal information) in respect of all of the information which Festival Republic collects and receives about you when you use our services.

Festival Republic is bound by, and uses your information in accordance with, the Data Protection Act 1998.

Cookies Notice

In common with many online businesses, we use cookies (i.e. small text files that are placed on your computer by our website) and tracking tools.

When you use our sites (including mobile sites or mobile apps), we and third party organisations may collect information by using 'cookies' and other technologies (for simplicity we refer to all such technologies as 'cookies'). For a list of the companies which use cookies and how they use them please access our Cookie Consent Tool. This is always available at the bottom corner of our sites. By continuing to use this site, when you register or create an account, you agree to us and third party organisations using cookies in line with your cookie settings. You can use the Cookie Consent Tool to change your preferences at any time.

_What are cookies and how do they work?_

Cookies are small bits of text that are downloaded to your computer or other device when you visit a website. Your browser sends these cookies back to the website every time you visit the site again, so it can recognise you and can then tailor what you see on the screen.

_What do we use cookies for?_

Our Cookie Consent Tool tells you which companies use which type of cookies. We have summarised the cookie types into the following three categories:

**_1\. To provide you with the service you have asked for (Essential cookies)_**

For example keeping you logged in during your visit. Without cookies the site might forget you and you'd have to constantly log back in.

**_2\. To show adverts that are more relevant to your interests (Advertising cookies)_**

For example we and third party organisations may use cookies to restrict the number of times you see the same advert or to show other adverts that may be more relevant to you - often called online behavioural advertising (OBA). OBA is a way of using information about your web-browsing activity, collected by using cookies, to group you with other users into interest groups and show you advertisements based on those interests.

**_3\. To analyse and improve your browsing experience (Analytics & Customisation cookies)_**

For example, for analysis purposes, we like to know what pages and links are popular and which ones don't get used so much to help us keep our sites relevant and up to date. We also use them to customise your visits to the site, for example to remember choices you make such as your language or region. Using browser settings to manage cookies

In addition to our Cookie Consent Tool, most browsers will enable you to manage your cookies preferences e.g. have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie or use it to disable cookies altogether. If you do decide to disable or delete them altogether some sites won't work as well as they rely on cookies to provide you with the service you have requested (see Essential cookies, above).

We collect your information in different ways

**Directly from you.** For example, if you register for a promotion, register or create an account, enter a competition or free prize draw, download an app or buy tickets, post a comment on our websites, ask us a question or email us.

**Through your use of our websites and apps.** You may view and use our websites and apps via a computer, phone, tablet or other device. We use tracking tools like browser cookies and web beacons on our websites and apps to collect information about your usage. To learn more, please see our Cookies Notice.

**From our Event Partners.** For example, our ticketing agents will provide us with certain information about you and your purchase to our festival or event such as your name and email address.

**From third parties.** For example, if you choose to use an integrated social media feature on our websites or apps, the third-party social media site will give us certain information about you. This could include your name and email address. Your activities on our sites and apps may be posted to the social media platforms. Further information about the third parties from whom we obtain information is available here.

For example, we may cross check the accuracy of the information we hold with other databases, or we may add demographic information. Much of this data is created using publicly available sources such as the edited electoral register or a publically available postal address list, or is derived from market research such as consumer panel surveys.

This may include advertisements displayed on our own websites or apps, or advertisements from us displayed on other companies’ sites. The advertisements you see may be based on information collected by us or third parties and/or may be based on your activities on our websites or third party sites. The second type of advertising is called ‘online or third party behavioural advertising’. Please see our Cookies Notice for more information and the choices you have.
