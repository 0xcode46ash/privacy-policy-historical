Inspire USA may revise this Privacy Policy at any time by placing a notice on the Site advising that the Privacy Policy has changed. You will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the revised Privacy Policy if you continue to use the Site after notice of the revised Privacy Policy has been placed on the Site. If revisions to the Privacy Policy are unacceptable to you or cause you to no longer be in compliance with the Privacy Policy, you must cease using the Site.

In some cases, we may ask for your Personal Information in order to provide the services you request or to help improve the Site. We will only collect Personal Information which you voluntarily provide to us when using the Site, including without limitation:

If you would like to apply to be a ReachOut Contributing Editor or a member of a special project team with the Site, you will need to provide your name, age, gender, contact details and racial and cultural background

If you choose to contribute any “User Submissions”, as defined in the Site’s Terms of Use, we will collect your IP address and you may also be required to submit your name, email address, mailing address, age, school, or other information.

If you choose to voluntarily complete one of the Site’s surveys, we may ask you for certain information to help us understand who is using the Site, including your age, gender, race, ethnicity, satisfaction with the Site, year in school, employment status, etc. These surveys will be voluntary and anonymous, and will not be linked to any Personal Information.

### 3\. Use of Personal Information

Inspire USA uses Personal Information to fulfil and process the requests of users, including to provide technical support or account maintenance. We may also use this information to provide you with updated information on new projects commenced by Inspire USA, to alert you to special events organized by Inspire USA, to let you know when new content has been added to the site, and to conduct research, surveys or engage in other marketing purposes.

In relation to the ReachOut Contributing Editor application form and the Special Project Team Member application form, any demographic information we may ask you to provide is used to help us have appropriate age, gender, racial and cultural, and geographic locations represented.

Subject to the exceptions listed below, Personal Information will only be accessed by Inspire USA management and personnel, Inspire USA’s affiliated entities including the Inspire Foundation, and Inspire USA’s contracted service providers and professional advisors, all of whom are bound by this Privacy Policy, and we will not give your personal information to advertisers and other organizations without your express consent.

In the following circumstances, Inspire USA may disclose your Personal Information without your consent:  
if we believe there is a serious and imminent threat to the life, health or safety of yourself or another person (for example, if we learn that a person is suffering abuse or has made statements of an intent to commit self-harm or harm another)  
to investigate or report on activity which we believe on reasonable grounds to be unlawful

if disclosure is required or authorized by law (for example, in response to a subpoena or where a regulatory authority has the power to request the provision of certain records or information)

if disclosure is reasonably necessary to enable an enforcement body to perform its functions, for example: 

the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences; and

the preparation for, or conduct of, proceedings before any court or tribunal, or implementation of the orders of a court or tribunal.

If Inspire USA deems necessary in its sole discretion to protect its legal and legitimate business interests.
