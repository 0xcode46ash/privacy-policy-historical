Website Privacy Policy

LAST UPDATE: [Feb. 18th, 2016]

RealClearLife (“RCL”, “we”, “our”, and “us”) respects your concerns about privacy and personal data protection and value our relationship with you.  This Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) applies solely to personal information collected through the RCL website and web pages that post, specifically reference and incorporate this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Site”), whether accessed via computer, mobile device or other device (collectively, “Device”).

This Policy describes the types of personal information we collect through the Site and how that personal information may be used and/or with whom it may be shared.  This Policy also describes how you can reach us to update your personal information, access and control the use of the personal information, or get answers to questions you may have about our privacy practices at this Site.  Please read this Policy carefully, because by accessing and using this Site you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the terms of this Policy.  In addition, please review our [Terms of Use](http://www.realclearlife.com/terms-of-service/), which governs your use of this Site.

1.  COLLECTION AND USE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION

Personal Information You Provide

The privacy and security of the personal information that RCL collects from you is a priority for RCL.  Generally you can visit this Site without providing personal information.  However there may be circumstances when you may be asked or choose to provide personal information that could reasonably be used to contact you or to identify you personally including, but not limited to, your name, email address, and inquiry information.  By submitting personal information to RCL at this Site, you hereby consent to RCL’s collection, use and disclosure of such personal information.

We may combine the personal information you submit directly through this Site with other personal information we have collected from you, whether on- or offline.  We may also combine it with information we receive about you from other sources, such as available information sources (including information from your publicly available social media profiles), and other third parties.

Passive Information Collection and Use

As you navigate around this Site, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information), using various technologies.  We and our third party service providers passively collect and use information in a variety of ways, including:

·      Through your browser:  Certain information is collected by most browsers, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system version, and Internet browser type and version.  We may collect similar information, such as your device type and identifier, if you access this Site through a mobile Device.

·      Cookies:  Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer you are using.  Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on this Site, pages visited, and language preferences.  We and our service providers use the information for security purposes, to facilitate navigation, and display information more effectively.  In addition, we use cookies to gather statistical information about Site usage in order to continually improve its design and functionality, understand how individuals use it, and to assist us with resolving questions regarding it.

You can choose to accept or decline cookies.  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies if you prefer.  If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it; (ii) to disable existing cookies; or (iii) to set your browser to automatically reject any cookies.

·      IP Address:  Your IP Address is a number that is automatically assigned to the computer that you are using by your Internet Service Provider.  An IP Address is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever a user visits this Site, along with the time of the visit and the page(s) that were visited.  Collecting IP Addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many web sites.  We use IP Addresses for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose server problems, and administering this Site.

·      Do Not Track Requests:  At this time RCL does not respond to Do Not Track signal requests.

Integrated Accounts and Social Media Information

We may implement applications or “widgets” from third party providers (e.g., Facebook, Twitter, etc.) that allow interaction, integration or content sharing with third party services.  These widgets or applications may be visible on a page you visit on our Site or may require log-in through the third party provider’s service.  The third party providing the widget or integration may offer controls for you to manage your interactions.  Any interaction with a third party widget or application typically allows the third party to collect some information about you (whether through cookies, registration information or otherwise).  These third parties may even track you when you do not interact with the widget.  If you have engaged any of these third party service providers, their respective privacy policies will govern their tracking and collection of information.  You should review these third party policies to understand these practices.

How We Use and Disclose Information

We use and disclose personal information you provide to us as described to you at the point of collection, such as when you (1) send us an inquiry through the Contact page, and (2) send e-mail messages or feedback, or transmit other information by e-mail.  If you elect to engage in such activities, we may ask that you provide us personal information, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), e-mail address, and telephone numbers.

We also use and transfer personal information from or about you:

·      to respond to your inquiries and fulfill your requests, such as to send you documents you request or e-mail;

·      to send you important information regarding our relationship with you or regarding this Site, changes to our terms, conditions, and policies and/or other administrative information; and

·      for our business purposes, such as data analysis, audits, developing new products or services, enhancing our Site, improving our products and services, identifying Site usage trends, and determining the effectiveness of our Site.

·      to our third party service providers who provide services such as website hosting and moderating, mobile application hosting, data analysis, infrastructure provision, IT services, auditing services, and other services, in order to enable them to provide services; and

·      to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets, or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

In addition, we use and disclose personal information collected through this Site as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) as permitted by applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with any legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence; (d) to enforce our [Terms of Use](http://www.realclearlife.com/terms-of-service/); (e) to protect our operations or those of any of our affiliates; (f) to protect our rights, privacy, safety, or property, and/or that of our affiliates, you, or others; and (g) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. We may also use and disclose personal information collected through this Site in other ways, with your prior consent.

We also use and disclose information we collect passively as described above, under “Passive Information Collection and Use,” and for any other purpose, except where we are required to do otherwise under applicable law (for example, if we are required to treat such information as personal information). In addition, we may use and disclose information that is not in personally identifiable form (such as anonymized, masked or de-identified information) for any purpose. If we combine information that is not in personally identifiable form with information that is (such as combining your name with your geographical location), we will treat the combined information as personal information as long as it is combined.
