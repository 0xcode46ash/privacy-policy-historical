# Ronald Reagan | Reagan Conservatism | Privacy Policy

Collection of Your Personal Information 

At Reagan.com, @Reagan.com, Reagan Search, and other Reagan sites, collectively the Reagan Network we ask you to provide personal information, such as name, your e-mail address, home or work address, or telephone number. We may also collect demographic information, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. If you choose to make a purchase or sign up for a paid subscription service, we will ask for additional information, such as your credit card number and billing address, which is used to create a Reagan Network account. 

In order to access some Reagan Network services, you will be asked to sign in with an e-mail address or user name and password. As part of creating your credentials, you may also be requested to provide questions and secret answers, which we use to help verify your identity and assist in resetting your password, as well as an alternate e-mail address. Some services may require added security, and in these cases, you may be asked to create an additional security key. 

We may collect information about your interaction with Reagan Network sites and services. For example, we may use site analytics tools on our site to retrieve information from your browser, including the site you came from, the search engine(s) and the keywords you used to find our site, the pages you view within our site, your browser add-ons, and your browser's width and height. We may also use technologies, such as cookies and web beacons (described below), to collect information about the pages you view, the links you click and other actions you take on our sites and services. Additionally, we collect certain standard information that your browser sends to every website you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access times and referring Web site addresses. When you receive newsletters or promotional e-mail from Reagan Network, we may use web beacons (described below), customized links or similar technologies to determine whether the e-mail has been opened and which links you click in order to provide you more focused e-mail communications or other information. 

In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Reagan Network, information collected through one Reagan Network service may be combined with information obtained through other Reagan Network services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area. 

Use of Your Personal Information 

Reagan Network collects and uses your personal information to operate and improve its sites and services. These uses may include providing you with more effective customer service; making the sites or services easier to use by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly enter the same information; performing research and analysis aimed at improving our products, and services and technologies. 

We also use your personal information to communicate with you. We may send certain mandatory service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Additionally, with your permission, we may send you information about other Reagan Network products and services, and/or share your personal information with Reagan Network partners so they may send you information about their products and services. 

Personal information collected on Reagan Network sites and services may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Reagan Network or its affiliates, subsidiaries or service providers maintain facilities. Reagan Network abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. 

Sharing of Your Personal Information 

Except as described in this statement, we will not disclose your personal information outside of Reagan Network and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates without your consent. 

Some Reagan Network services may be co-branded and offered in conjunction with another company. If you register for or use such services, both Reagan Network and the other company may receive information collected in conjunction with the co-branded services. 

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as handling the processing and delivery of mailings, providing customer support, hosting websites, processing transactions, or performing statistical analysis of our services. Those service providers will be permitted to obtain only the personal information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose. However, for credit card processing, our fraud detection vendors may use aggregate data to help improve their service. This helps them more accurately detect fraudulent uses of credit cards. We may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Reagan Network or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Reagan Network employees, customers or the public. We may also disclose personal information as part of a corporate transaction such as a merger or sale of assets. 

Accessing Your Personal Information 

You may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In order to help prevent your personal information from being viewed by others, you will be required to sign in with your e-mail address or user name and password. The appropriate method(s) for accessing your personal information will depend on which sites or services you have used. 

Communication Preferences 

You can stop the delivery of future promotional e-mail from Reagan Network sites and services by following the specific instructions in the e-mail you receive. 

You may also have the option of proactively making choices about the receipt of promotional e-mail, telephone calls, and postal mail from particular Reagan Network sites or services.: 

Security of Your Personal Information 

Reagan Network is committed to protecting the security of your personal information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the personal information you provide on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities. When we transmit highly confidential information (such as a credit card number or password) over the Internet, we protect it through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. 

If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential. Do not share this information with anyone. If you are sharing a computer with anyone you should always log out before leaving a site or service to protect access to your information from subsequent users. 

Use of Cookies 

Reagan Network Web sites use "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies contain information that can later be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. 

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content and appropriate advertising on your later visits to these sites. Reagan Network Web sites also use cookies as described in the Collection of your information and 

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of Reagan Network sites and services that depend on cookies, and some advertising preferences that are dependent on cookies may not be able to be respected. 

If you choose to accept cookies, you also have the ability to later delete cookies that you have accepted. In Internet Explorer 7, you can delete cookies by selecting “Tools”, “Delete browsing history” and clicking the “Delete Cookies” button.

Use of Web Beacons 

Reagan Network Web pages may contain electronic images known as Web beacons - sometimes called single-pixel gifs - that may be used to assist in delivering cookies on our sites and allow us to count users who have visited those pages and to deliver co-branded services. We may include Web beacons in promotional e-mail messages or our newsletters in order to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. 

Reagan Network may also employ Web beacons from third parties in order to help us compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other operations of our sites. We prohibit Web beacons on our sites from being used by third parties to collect or access your personal information. 

Finally, we may work with other companies that advertise on Reagan Network sites to place Web beacons on their sites in order to allow us to develop statistics on how often clicking on an advertisement on a Reagan Network site results in a purchase or other action on the advertiser's site. 

Controlling Unsolicited E-mail ("Spam") 

Reagan Network is concerned about controlling unsolicited commercial e-mail, or "spam." Reagan Network has a strict Anti Spam Policy prohibiting the use of a Reagan Network-provided e-mail account to send spam. Reagan Network will not sell, lease or rent its e-mail subscriber lists to third parties. While Reagan Network continues to actively review and implement new technology, such as expanded filtering features, there is no currently available technology that will totally prevent the sending and receiving of unsolicited e-mail. Using junk e-mail tools and being cautious about the sharing of your e-mail address while online will help reduce the amount of unsolicited e-mail you receive. 

Changes to This Privacy Statement 

We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our services and customer feedback. When we post changes to this Statement, we will revise the "last updated" date at the bottom of this statement. If there are material changes to this statement or in how Reagan Network will use your personal information, we will notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes prior to implementing the change or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to periodically review this statement to be informed of how Reagan Network is protecting your information.
