# RealtyTrac: Privacy Policy

_RealtyTrac recognizes the importance of protecting your personal and financial  
information when you visit our Web site. The personal information (i.e., name  
and address) we require when you register is used only to service your request  
and provide you with information regarding our current products and services._  


  
**E-mail  
**RealtyTrac will not send you e-mail without first receiving your permission,  
unless it relates to servicing your account. It is our policy to include instructions  
for un-subscribing so that you do not receive any future e-mail that is not directly  
related to servicing your account. RealtyTrac does not sell its customers’ e-mail   
addresses, nor will we provide your personal information to third parties for the   
purpose of sending you unwanted/unsolicited communications of any kind. 

**Surveys  
**Occasionally, we conduct surveys on our Web site. The information you provide  
in these surveys is used collectively for analytical purposes, and individual  
responses are not tracked. You will not receive unsolicited communications as  
a result of your participation in these surveys.

**Personal Data  
**RealtyTrac understands that it can be time consuming to re-enter personal data  
to  transmit a request. Through the use of “cookies,” your name and address  
may be conveniently pre-completed on the request forms or access screens of  
our Web site. Cookies are pieces of data stored on your computer that enable  
us to pre-complete your information.

**Security  
**When accessing your account to conduct transactions on our Web site,   
RealtyTrac protects your personal information by requiring the use of a browser  
software program that supports 128-bit encryption. The “128-bit” designation  
refers to the length of the key used to encrypt the data being transmitted, with  
a longer key representing a higher level of security.

If you have any additional questions about our privacy policy, please send us  
e-mail at [info@realtytrac.com](mailto:info@realtytrac.com).
