# RealtyTrac - Privacy Policy

_RealtyTrac recognizes the importance of protecting your personal and financial  
information when you visit our Web site. The personal information (i.e., name  
and address) we require when you register is used only to service your request  
and provide you with information regarding our current products and services._  


  
**E-mail  
**RealtyTrac will not send you e-mail without first receiving your permission, unless it relates to servicing your account. It is our policy to include instructions for un-subscribing so that you do not receive any future e-mail that is not directly related to servicing your account. 

**Surveys  
**Occasionally, we conduct surveys on our Web site. The information you provide in these surveys is used collectively for analytical purposes, and individual responses are not tracked. You will not receive unsolicited communications as a result of your participation in these surveys.

**Security  
**When accessing your account to conduct transactions on our Web site, RealtyTrac protects your personal information by requiring the use of a browser software program that supports 128-bit encryption. The “128-bit” designation refers to the length of the key used to encrypt the data being transmitted, with a longer key representing a higher level of security.
