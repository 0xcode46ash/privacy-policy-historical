Reader's Digest Online Privacy Policy

In over 75 years in the Direct Marketing business, Reader's Digest has adhered to the highest standards in assuring our customers' privacy. All information—including customer accounts, transactions, and all correspondence, are handled with the utmost discretion.

The policies below are applicable to readersdigest.com and other sites on the World Wide Web originating in the U.S. and owned and operated by Reader's Digest unless otherwise indicated.

Collection of Personal Information  
The only personal information collected by Reader’s Digest through our web sites is information which is submitted to us voluntarily and knowingly by site visitors. When you simply browse our sites, no personal information is being collected by Reader’s Digest.

Some functions and services offered through our site require that you provide certain personal information, for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog, or register for a mailing list, we may need your postal or e-mail address. 

Receiving E-mail and Postal Correspondence  
Our online registration forms contain a clearly identified checkbox that indicates that by submitting the form you will be entitled to receive e-mail correspondence from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners unless you opt out of being included in our mailing list. Web site visitors over the age of 18 who have submitted their names, mailing addresses, or e-mail addresses and have not opted out, may occasionally receive e-mail correspondence from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners containing information such as newsletters or special offers. Our purpose is to provide visitors with useful information and offers that will interest them. Reader’s Digest will consider permission granted to send such information if a form is submitted without a check mark in the box labeled "by submitting this form, you will be entitled to receive special offers via e-mail from Reader's Digest, its affiliates and partners. If you do not wish to receive these offers, please check this box."

Reader's Digest will not share e-mail addresses we collect through our web sites with any unaffiliated third parties unless we specify at the point of collection. Occasionally, Reader's Digest may make names and postal addresses we collect through our web sites available to reputable companies whose products and/or services may interest you unless you opt out of being included in our postal mailing list.

Reader’s Digest may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third parties for statistical analysis, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

Opting Out  
Receiving e-mail messages from Reader’s Digest, our affiliates and partners, is optional. You may choose not to receive e-mail, even after granting prior permission, or you may wish to correct information you previously provided. If you do not wish to receive e-mail or wish to correct information you provided to Reader’s Digest, please click here to go to the [Privacy Options Form](https://web.archive.org/web/20001204014100id_/http%3A//readersdigest.com/custserv/privacy/PrvyOptn.asp) in our Online Customer Service area, or send an e-mail message to "[removeme.rdw@readersdigest.com](mailto:removeme.rdw@readersdigest.com)." 

Reader’s Digest will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete records from our database when we receive requests to do so; however because of possible retention of a residual copy in a system backup file, we cannot guarantee deletion in every instance.

If you prefer not to receive postal mailings from Reader's Digest or from reputable companies we may share your name and postal address with, write to us at the address below or go to the Privacy Options Form in our Online Customer Service area.

Online Policy for Individuals 17 Years Old and Under  
No personal information should be submitted or posted at Reader's Digest Online Web Sites by individuals 17 years of age or under without their parent's or guardian's permission. We may request name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and date of birth from your child for contest participation and so that we may notify him or her if selected a winner. In the event we do so, we will request your consent prior to collection.

No information collected from online guests 17 years of age or under is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever by Reader's Digest. Unless otherwise disclosed at collection, Reader's Digest does not provide any personally identifying information collected through our web sites from individuals 17 years old and under, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.

Note to parents: If your child has submitted his or her name through a Reader's Digest web site, and you wish to review that information, to have it corrected or deleted from our records, or to refuse to permit further collection or use of the children's information, please communicate your wishes to us at Reader's Digest Customer Services, P.O. Box 235, Pleasantville, NY 10570-0235, or via e-mail to Parents.rdw@readersdigest.com or call us at 1-800-934-0977. Reader's Digest pledges to exert reasonable efforts to assure that the information is deleted as soon as possible.

Some Reader's Digest contests are open to individuals 17 years old and under if the official rules so provide. In such contests, if a winner is 17 years old or under, notification and prizes are sent to the parent or guardian who is also required to complete all necessary documents.

We encourage parents to be aware of their children's online activities, and to learn about software that can filter objectionable materials. We cannot and will not request more information from your child than is reasonably necessary to participate in any online activity.

Advertisers  
If you submit your name through a form on a Reader’s Digest web site to request information from an advertiser or other third party, such as in the "Reader’s Digest Travel Center," Reader’s Digest is not responsible for any marketing or other use of your name by the third party. To learn more about any other company or organization’s privacy policies, we suggest visiting their web site or contacting them by postal mail or telephone.

The ads appearing on the Reader's Digest web site are delivered to you by DoubleClick, our Web advertising partner. In the course of delivering an ad to you DoubleClick collects certain non-personally identifiable information about you. This information is used to deliver tailored ads to you.

Unless otherwise disclosed, Reader’s Digest does not use the names or e-mail addresses of people who post messages in our online bulletin boards or forums for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever. However, please be aware that bulletin board and forums postings are not private. Others may capture your e-mail address and send you e-mail messages. Reader’s Digest cannot control such actions by others; however, we urge you and any other bulletin board user not to use our forums as a source of e-mail addresses for sending unsolicited messages. For more information on our bulletin boards, please see "[Reader’s Digest World Forum Policies](http://www.readersdigest.com/scripts/webx.cgi?98@@index.html)."

Only individuals 18 years of age or older may participate in our bulletin boards.

Keyword search functions are provided in some areas of Reader’s Digest web site as a convenience to our users. We do not collect your name or e-mail address as a result of using a search feature, nor do we tabulate search terms entered by individuals. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information our web site visitors are seeking, and to improve our service to visitors.

Other Interactive Features  
If there is no clearly identified information indicating that you may receive correspondence and an "opt-out" checkbox, we will not save your name or e-mail address when you use an interactive feature on our site, such as when you "send a friend a laugh" in the Reader’s Digest Laugh Bank area.

E-mail messages  
If you send Reader’s Digest an e-mail message, we may retain that message and your e-mail address, as well any response we send you. 

Hyperlinks to Other Web Sites  
Reader's Digest web sites may include links to web sites of other companies unaffiliated with Reader's Digest. We do not log visitors’ clicks from our site to other sites. Please note that we are unable to review all such sites and take no responsibility for the content of any unaffiliated web site.

Cookies and Server Logs  
Reader’s Digest, related web hosting providers, and advertisers sometimes utilize "cookie" technology. Cookies are bits of data stored on your local hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your web browsing experience.

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data, such as the time and date of a web visit, the browser and operating system being used, the IP address or domain name of the user’s ISP, and the web URL a user linked from. This information is used in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content which is compatible with our visitors’ web browsing systems.
