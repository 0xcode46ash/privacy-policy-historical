**Cookies, Web Beacons and Server Logs**

Reader’s Digest, related Web hosting providers, and advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies sometimes utilize “cookie” technology on TMBI Sites. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your Web-browsing experience. Not all Web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy TMBI Sites.

We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the TMBI Sites to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the TMBI Sites and may display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies.

We may collect information using Web beacons. Web beacons are electronic images that may be used on TMBI Sites or in our emails. We use Web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon.

Server logs capture certain non-personally identifying data, such as the time and date of a Web visit, the browser and operating system being used, and the Web URL a user linked from. This information is used in aggregate form to help us plan system enhancements when necessary and to provide content that is compatible with our visitors’ Web-browsing systems. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the TMBI Sites. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information rd.com visitors are seeking, and to improve our service to visitors.
