Welcome to the web site www.realtyshares.com (the “Site”) owned and operated by RealtyShares, Inc. (hereinafter, “RealtyShares”, “we”, “us”, and/or “our”). This Privacy Policy has been created to provide information about our company and its financial matchmaking services (the “Services”) to all visitors of the Site and the users of the Services provided thereon, including, but not limited to, investment managers offering an investment (the “Issuer”) and investors using the site to invest (in each case, a “User”, and collectively, “Users”). This Privacy Policy sets forth RealtyShares’ policy with respect to information, including personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”), and other information that is collected from Users.

When you interact with us through the Site or Services, we may collect and process Personal Information and other information from you, as further described below: 

Personal Information That You Provide Through the Site. We collect Personal Information from you when you voluntarily provide such information such as when you (i) register for access to the Services (for example, contact information such as your name, email address, phone number, mailing address); (ii) complete certain forms on the Site; (iii) upload or submit any material through the Site, (iv) request any information or contact us with inquiries; or (v) wish to use certain Services (for example financial information such as bank account numbers, your Date of Birth and the last 4 digits of your social security number). This Personal Information is required to transact business, to communicate with you, verify your identity and fulfill legal and regulatory requirements. 

By voluntarily providing us with Personal Information, you are giving RealtyShares permission to use and store it consistent with this Privacy Policy. We may also obtain your personal information from your transactions with us or other Users through the Services, or from third parties such as credit reporting agencies. If we combine or associate information from other sources with personal information that you provide directly to us through or in connection with the Services, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Non-Identifying Information. As is the case with most websites, when you visit the Site or interact with RealtyShares through the Site or Services (and whether or not you register for access to the Services), we receive, automatically track and store certain non-identifying information about you, including but not limited to:

This information, which may be collected passively using various technologies or through other means, cannot be used to specifically identify you. RealtyShares may store such information itself or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained by RealtyShares affiliates, agents or service providers. The Site may use such information and pool it with other information for administrative purposes, to assess the usage, value and performance of our products and services, to improve your experience with the Services and to track, for example, how our Users use and interact with the Services. 

Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Services, RealtyShares often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to RealtyShares by Issuers and Users.
