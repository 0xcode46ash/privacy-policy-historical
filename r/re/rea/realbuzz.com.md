**Personal information**

As the protection of your privacy is of the greatest importance to us, we have created this Privacy policy to communicate our practices regarding the collection and dissemination of ‘personal information’ that can be linked to a specific individual, such as a name, address, gender, phone number, email address, or any other information provided to us by users who have registered with us (Members) and email subscribers. You do not have to share personal information to use the Website. The Website does not collect personal information about people without their permission.

**How we collate and use personal information**

The Website gathers personal information by means of the following methods: signing up to the Website; and through events and exhibitions. Newsletters are sent out to all site members, other than those who have opted out using their account settings options or those who have chosen to unsubscribe. In order to provide you with improved, relevant content, we compile information about email response and website usage. This information helps us to better understand our Members' and email subscribers’ site usage patterns and also what types of content and information may help improve your user experience on the Website.

To improve our online services the Website periodically performs statistical analyses of aggregate user behaviour and characteristics in order to measure interest in and use of various areas of the website and to use such information to improve on the ability to serve you better.

The personal information we gather from subscribers to our email newsletters (including email addresses) is not shared with other organisations or third parties without permission. The Website is extremely protective of the information gathered through its online membership and email subscriptions. Provided you have given your consent, we may from time to time i) send out emails on behalf of like-minded organisations, but we do not provide them with access to any other personal information, or ii) share your data with other carefully selected organizations for the purposes of contacting you about products and services that we think we may be of interest to you.

These links are provided for your convenience only. If you access these sites by using the links provided, the operators of these sites may collect information from you which will be used by them in accordance with their privacy policy.

**The use of cookies**

To enhance your experience of the Website, all of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your email address or other personally identifiable information. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie.

We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalise your experience of the Website (e.g. to recognise you by name when you return to the Website), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts. We also may use cookies to offer you products of potential interest in emails. If you do not wish to receive cookies, or want to be notified of when they are placed, your browser may permit you to do so. However, this will inhibit the functionality of the Website on your browser.

We will use this information to make our website and the advertising displayed on it more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with third parties for this purpose.

Open-tracking allows us to find out how many people have viewed our email newsletters and click-tracking allows us to find out which links in the newsletter were clicked on. This helps us to refine and improve the editorial content of the Website’s newsletters, and to provide you with relevant information.
