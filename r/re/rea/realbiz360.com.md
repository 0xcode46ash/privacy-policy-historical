Cookies 

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site on RealBiz360. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

** Communications from the Site **

Links 

This web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we at Real Biz LLC are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this web site. 

Special Offers and Updates 

We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the “Choice/Opt-out.” 

Service-related Announcements 

We will send you strictly service-related announcements when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. 

Customer Service 

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes. 

Profile 

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and or third party sources to create a “profile” of your preferences. We link your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. 

We do not share your profile with other third parties. 

Correction/Updating Personal Information 

If your personally identifiable information changes (such as address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct, update or remove that user’s personal data provided to us. This can usually be done within your personal account in RealBiz360.com or by emailing our Customer Support at [support@realbiz360.com](mailto:support@realbiz360.com) or contact Real Biz LLC at 1-888-732-5249 (888-REAL-BIZ). 

**Security**

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card numbers) on our registration or order forms, we use the best encryption software, using secure socket layer technology-SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just ‘surfing’ the web. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable) 

We share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers. This information does not identify individual users. 

**Log Files**

As is true for most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.

**Notification of Changes**

If RealBiz360.com decides to change the privacy policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
