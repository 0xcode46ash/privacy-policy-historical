**Your Privacy**

We are committed to maintaining your privacy. 

The Internet contains a wealth of information. Unfortunately, it may also contain personal details you do not want publicly shared. For example, your real name (many people on the Internet use aliases, alter egos, or nicknames), street address, phone number, or e-mail address. When you go online, sites you visit may be gathering information about you without your knowledge. 

At Reeds.com, we respect your right to confidentiality, and are committed to protecting your privacy. The information we gather on our Web site is used to process your order efficiently and effectively, and to determine the products and services that will be of most value to you. To ensure your privacy, it is our policy not to sell or rent our mailing list to anyone or any company. 

**Information We Collect and How It’s Used**

**Your IP Address  
** An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer every time you browse the Internet. When users request a page from our site, our servers log the user's current IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our servers and to administer our Web site. We do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable. This means that a user session will be tracked, but the user will be anonymous. 

**Cookies  
** "Cookies" are pieces of data your browser stores on your computer's hard drive. They enable us to determine when you — or someone using the same browser you previously used — revisits Reeds. Cookies also enable us to create a more personalized shopping experience for you. 

Most browsers are set up to accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to refuse them. Reeds does not use cookies to retrieve personal information about you from your computer. 

**Your Account  
** When you set up an account with Reeds, we will ask you for information about how to contact you, your preferred method of payment, and your preferred shipping address. If necessary, we use your contact information to reach you for help processing an order you have placed. We may ask for demographic and interest-based information when you create an account. Whether you provide such information is purely optional. We may, from time to time, use this information to send those on our mailing list notices about upcoming events and promotions. 

**Other Information We Collect  
** When you purchase a product or make an offer on a product, we ask you for information such as name, address, and credit card information. We store and use this information so we can process your order. If necessary, we may use this information to contact you for help processing the order. Whenever you send us personal correspondence, such as e-mail or letters, we may collect and store such information. This ensures more efficient customer service and enables us to provide you with the most current information concerning your account. 

**About Children**  
For their protection, children are not eligible to use Reeds’ services. Because we are not a children's site, we do not provide most of the privacy measures that are so important for their protection on the Internet. Because of this, we ask that minors do not submit any information to Reeds without the expressed consent and participation of a parent or guardian. 

**Removing Your Information from Our Records**  
If for some reason, you want us to remove your credit card and contact information from our database, we will — after all of your transactions have been completed. Simply follow the instructions given on the Web site while accessing your account, or contact us at: 1-800-545-7977 or (910) 350-3200. Such information, however, is never completely removed from our database archives because we routinely back up our servers for disaster recovery and tax-record purposes. 

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

**Personal Information**  
Personal information includes your name, e-mail address, mailing address, method of payment information and other data that identifies you as an individual. 

Your personal information is used by Reeds, our suppliers and shippers in order to process and ship your orders. Reeds does not sell, trade, rent or release your personal information to third parties. 

**Data Security**  
Many steps have been taken in order to prevent unauthorized access, maintain accuracy, and guarantee proper use of information. To ensure this, we have placed appropriate devices, as well as secure personnel and management in charge of your personal information so that we can safeguard all information we collect online. We do not use or share any personally identifiable information provided to us online in any ways other than those previously specified without also giving you the opportunity to prohibit or opt-out of such uses. 

**Aggregate Information**  
Reeds occasionally shares aggregate data about customers, traffic patterns, sales, and other site information with partners, vendors, and other reputable third parties. This data, however, does not contain any personally identifying information such as email, telephone numbers, names, or addresses. For example, we do not disclose that you purchased a specific product, but we may share statistics on how many customers have purchased a specific product. 

**Legal Issues**  
Reeds discloses personal information when required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to:   
**·** Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with a legal process served on Reeds or its Web site; **·** Protect and defend the rights or property of Reeds, the site, or the users of Reeds;   
**·** And act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Reeds, its Web site, or the public. 

**Credit Card Security**

Shopping on the Internet is incredibly safe. 

At Reeds, we ensure that it is safe by transferring all of your personal information, including your name, address and credit card, over a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) line. This ensures that your information is encrypted and cannot be read by others as it travels over the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. You will know you're in secure mode when the tiny padlock icon — located at the bottom of your browser — appears as "locked." 

You also can verify you are in secure mode by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." After the information reaches Reeds, it is stored on a secure server, which means it resides behind a firewall and cannot be accessed from outside the company. At that point, your information can only be accessed by employees to process your orders. All such employees sign a privacy/security policy, which provides legal confidentiality protections for our customers. Violations of this policy result in disciplinary actions, including the possibility of termination, criminal prosecution and civil action. 

Your Reeds account is password-protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Reeds will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. 

Remember to sign out of your Reeds account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others or if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. 

**VeriSign – The Sign of Trust on the Net  
** Reeds Jewelers is registered with VeriSign, the leading provider of digital authentication services and products for electronic commerce and other forms of secure communications. All information sent to us through our web site is automatically encrypted for safe storage. The VeriSign Secure Site Program allows you to learn more about Web sites you visit before you submit any confidential information.

VeriSign has verified the organizational name and that Reeds Jewelers, Inc. has the proof of right to use it. This site legitimately runs under the auspices of Reeds Jewelers, Inc. All information sent to this site, if in an SSL session, is encrypted, protecting against disclosure to third parties. 

**Your Consent**

By using our Web site, you are consenting to the collection, storage, and dissemination of data as described above. We will post any changes to our Privacy Policy on this page so you can readily review our most current policy. Reeds also reserves the right to e-mail you regarding changes to our Privacy Policy or any other matters Reeds thinks is necessary for the administration of the site.
