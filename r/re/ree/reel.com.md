_How We Use Personally Identifiable Information_  
Reel.com uses your personally identifiable information to personalize your experience on our Web site, to bill your credit card for purchases, to ship and confirm your orders, to prevent fraud against you, and to contact you. For example, when you place an order on Reel.com, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, shipping address and credit card information. This allows us to fulfill your order and notify you of your order status. 

For more information about how we use personally identifiable information, please [Click Here](https://web.archive.org/web/20001020054316id_/http%3A//www.reel.com/reel.asp%3Fnode%3Dabout/reel.asp?node=about/privacy/detailed). 

Reel.com also compiles aggregate data from all of our customers to prepare internal reports about which pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns. Reel.com does not combine your personally identifiable information with information about pages visited, purchases made, or any other clickstream data. 

_Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To_  
Reel.com will not sell, rent, trade or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. Reel.com may disclose some personal information to outside companies who help Reel.com with the administration and delivery of purchases, newsletters, the Reel magazine, promotional games, trivia contests and sweepstakes. For example, a company who administers a sweepstakes for us may use your e-mail address to update you on your status in the sweepstakes. Or, our newsletters or the Reel magazine may be distributed by another company who will use your e-mail or shipping address for delivery. 

The Reel.com Web site contains links to other Web sites. Although we **do not** provide any personally identifiable information to these companies, we cannot guarantee your privacy once you leave the Reel.com Web site. Reel.com is not responsible for the privacy policies, practices or content of Web sites with links on our site. Also, shopping services for our customers are now provided by **buy.com** through a link on our site. When you make a purchase, you will enter your personally identifiable information directly on the **buy.com** Web site. You should review **buy.com** 's privacy policy if you choose to make purchases. 

Aggregate statistical data gathered from customers, but NOT personally identifiable information, may be shared with our [Producer Program](https://web.archive.org/web/20001020054316id_/http%3A//www.reel.com/reel.asp%3Fnode%3Dabout/reel.asp?node=affiliates) affiliates in order to calculate sales information. Reel.com may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Reel.com or others.
