**1\. Statement of intent**  
From time to time, you will be asked to submit personal information about yourself (eg name and email address etc) in order to receive or use services on our website. Such services include news about publications, policy briefs, press releases etc. By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable Reed Elsevier to provide you with the services you select.

2\. Submitting personal information**   
When you supply any personal information to Reed Elsevier (eg for publications, press release subscription etc) we have legal obligations towards you in the way we deal with that data. We must collect the information fairly (see the notices on particular web pages that let you know why we are requesting the information); we must let you know how we will use it; and we must tell you in advance if we decide to pass the information on to anyone else. We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as you use the service you have requested, and remove it in the event that the purpose has been met, or, in the case of a personalised service, such as "publications alert", you no longer wish to continue your registration as a personalised user. Where personal information is held for people who are not yet registered but have taken part in other Reed Elsevier services (feedback from mail outs etc), that information will be held only as long as necessary to ensure that the service is run smoothly. We will ensure that all personal information supplied is held securely, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

We may also offer you the opportunity to participate in surveys, carried out by Reed Elsevier or its agents. Reed Elsevier will keep a record of information provided by you. Please note that any information you provide will only be used within the organisation. It will never be supplied to third parties without first obtaining your consent unless we are obliged by law to disclose information.
