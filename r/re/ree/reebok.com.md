#### Reebok Privacy Policy

  
 **The policies below are applicable to reebok.com:**

Privacy refers to information that we at Reebok International Ltd. ("Reebok") gather about you and the use that we make of it in the course of our business.

Reebok collects personally identifying information only during contest, sweepstakes and site membership registration. In addition, information is collected in certain portions of the site in which guests specifically and knowingly provide such information along with content submissions, community postings (i.e., chat or bulletin boards), suggestions, or voting. Reebok may use such information for editorial and feedback purposes (to the extent that is explained when guests provide the information). In the event Reebok plans to post any such information on a site, guests are provided prior notification of such posting and can decline from having such information posted.

 **Policies for Individuals 16 and Under:**

No information should be submitted to or posted at reebok.com by children 16 years of age or under without their parent's or guardian's consent.

Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, reebok.com does not provide any personally identifying information, regardless of its source, to any third party for any purpose whatsoever.

Although children are allowed to participate in contests, children ages 16 and under must get their parent's or guardian's permission before entering any sweepstakes or contests.

No information collected from children 16 years of age or under is used for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever, either inside or outside Reebok.

Guests' e-mail addresses are never posted on reebok.com.

Reebok encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on the sites.

Reebok recognizes that families are concerned about privacy and especially about the privacy of their children online. Reebok, its staff, contractors, and others who help us operate our Web site follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of Reebok Online. Reebok Online always meets or exceeds the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998.

 **Policies for Individuals Over 16 Years of Age:**

Information submitted at the time of any form of registration by a guest who is over 16 years of age may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by Reebok. Reebok does not share this information with other companies. If a guest objects to such use for any reason, he/she may stop that use at any time by written request.

 **Use of Cookies:**

What are cookies? Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes while at the site. Cookies make Web-surfing easier by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences for you. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major Web sites.

Reebok does not use information transferred through cookies for any promotional or marketing purposes, nor is the information shared with any third parties whatsoever. Reebok does not use cookies to identify individuals or to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent in a cookie.

Cookies help make reebok.com better by showing how and when guests use the site. They do not, however, gather user specific information about persons who use the site. Many content improvements and updates are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This statistical information is most easily tracked with cookies.

You may occasionally get cookies from our advertisers. These cookies are sent from third-party computers and are subject to the above-stated policies.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies. However, it is possible that some areas of the site will not function properly if youdo so.

Reebok reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying guests of the existence of a new privacy policy. You can send mail with any further questions to us at:
