# Reece & Nichols Real Estate, Mortgage, Closing Title Experts | PRIVACY

**Our Privacy Policy**

At Reece & Nichols Realtors, we recognize that you expect privacy and security when it comes to information that personally identifies you and allows you to be individually contacted ("Personal Information"). Reece & Nichols Realtors has adopted the following online privacy policy because we understand the need to safeguard the information you may be providing to us at our web site.

**Why we request information about you**

Reece & Nichols Realtors offers a variety of programs and services to you from personalized home searches to online mortgage applications. We collect and retain information about you only when we believe it will help us provide you with the services and products that you desire.

**Personalized Home Match Registration**

When you sign up for our personalized home match, we may use that information to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our web site, new Reece & Nichols Realtors products or services, the products and services of our affiliates, and special offers we think you'll find valuable.

**Online Forms**

When you request other information from us through our various order forms, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address and telephone numbers so we can be sure to get in touch with you when and how you ask us to. For instance, when you apply for an online mortgage loan, we need to know your name, social security number, e-mail address, mailing address, income, debt and asset information. This information is necessary to process your mortgage application and to obtain your credit report. We will not obtain your credit report without your authorization, but we cannot approve you for a mortgage loan without it. We can, however, pre-qualify you for a mortgage loan without your credit report.  We will share the information collected on these forms only with our affiliates and those entities providing services necessary to complete your transaction.  We do not sell your information to any person or entity.

**How we protect your financial information**

When you apply for an online mortgage loan, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure socket layer software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Even though you may not see a padlock in the bottom of your browser window, rest assured that all the information you enter is encrypted before being sent to our order center. The information we receive from you also is protected against unauthorized access once we receive it. We limit access to your financial information to employees who have a business reason for accessing it. We also educate our employees about the importance of your privacy through our educational programs and company policies.

**About Our Cookies**

Cookies are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer hard drive. Our cookies allow us to welcome you back to our site and provide you with your personalized home searches. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser to prevent cookies from being placed on your computer without your consent. You can still use our regular home search feature and every other function on our site even though your computer will not accept cookies. Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to discover your identity and we do not know your identity unless you tell us.

**Links to other web sites**

Our web site contains links to other web sites and may be in the form of display advertising. We cannot guarantee that web sites other than reeceandnichols.com will respect and protect your Personal Information in the same manner that we do. We urge you to go to and read the Privacy Statements of other web sites when you visit them for your own protection. We also are not responsible for the content of web sites other than reeceandnichols.com.

**Your consent**

When you provide us with Personal Information, you consent to the collection and use of this information by Reece & Nichols Realtors, its affiliates, and those entities providing services necessary to complete your transaction. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
