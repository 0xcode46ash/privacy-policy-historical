New privacy provisions in the Privacy Act 1988 affecting private sector organisations such as Reece come into effect on 21 December 2001. The provisions will regulate the collection, storage and use of personal information obtained by Reece and will also operate to give Customers greater control over the way information about them is handled by requiring Reece to comply with the ten (10) legally binding National Privacy Principles ["NPPs"] which govern how Reece must handle personal information. The NPPs cover: 

  * collection (NPP 1);
  * use and disclosure (NPP 2);
  * data quality (NPP 3);
  * data security (NPP 4);
  * openness (NPP 5);
  * access and correction (NPP 6);
  * identifiers (NPP 7);
  * anonymity (NPP 8);
  * transborder flow of data (NPP 9); and
  * sensitive information (NPP 10).



Details of the NPPs and guidelines to assist Customers are available on request. 

Reece will now need to ensure that all reasonable measures are taken to make Customers aware of the fact that personal information about them is being collected, of the purposes for which that information is being collected and of the third parties (if any) to whom that information is being passed. Reece will also respect the new legislative restrictions on the use that can be made of personal information. 

Customers will also have the right to gain access to personal information about them which is held by Reece and to have that information corrected or annotated if the information is incorrect, out-of-date or incomplete. Customers may also complain to the Federal Privacy Commissioner if they think information about them is not being properly handled. 

Customers should be aware that Reece only collects and retains personal information which is relevant to the on-going trading relationship with Reece. At no time is any "sensitive information" knowingly sought or retained. "Sensitive information" includes information or opinion about an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious beliefs or affiliation, philosophical beliefs, membership of a professional or trade association, membership of a trade union, sexual preference or practices, criminal record or health information. 

Any query or complaint should be directed to Reece's Privacy Officer, Mr Stephen Willcocks (on ph. (03) 9274 0000) or to the Federal Privacy Commissioner.
