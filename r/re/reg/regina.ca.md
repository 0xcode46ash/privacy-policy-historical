### How is my personal information protected?

The City takes many precautions to safeguard your personal information against loss, theft, and misuse, as well as against unauthorized collection, access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These measures include various forms of physical, technical and administrative precautions.

_The Act_  protects personal information by restricting its collection, use and disclosure.

The City must only collect personal information that relates to the services provided by a municipality and the collection must be limited to information necessary for the provision of the service. The City has an obligation to inform the individual why the information is being collected and what it will be used for. The information must be used for the purpose for which it was collected or a use consistent with that purpose. Before the information is used for any other purpose, the City must obtain consent from the individual, preferably in writing.

_The Act_  provides for disclosure of personal information without consent in limited circumstances such as:

  * By subpoena or warrant
  * To legal counsel
  * To protect the mental or physical health or safety of an individual
  * To assist in the provision of services to the individual
  * To comply with an Act or regulation



There are security measures in place to protect personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. For example: If a bylaw enforcement complaint is made, the City would ask for personal information such as name, address and telephone number of the caller in order to keep the individual informed about the handling of the complaint.  As a complainant, the personal information provided is protected and is not made public. The only time the identity of a complainant would be disclosed is to comply with court proceedings.
