When you, the customer, agree to purchase RegTOOL.com software, we may collect limited personally identifying information. This information, including your name, address, and email address is necessary to record and fulfill the minimum requirements of a transaction. If and when we use a payment processing merchant, we take pains to ensure that the same security measures are in place regarding the transaction of data with that merchant. We do not ever knowingly collect personal data from any person or persons under the age of eighteen.

Every cookie that RegTOOL assigns to machines that access our servers is non-unique and non-identifiable. All RegTOOL.com cookies are characterized as secure and non-invasive by these criteria:

To safeguard personally identifying information, we store all transaction records in limited access servers, safeguarded by encrypted access. We do this to protect the security of personal data as well as that of the servers themselves. We retain the personally identifying information only long enough to complete a purchase, to deter fraud, to provide customer service, and/or to maintain your account with us.

We may use information in the following ways: 

  * To enable us to process, validate and verify purchases.

  * To obtain your feedback to help enhance existing features or provide additional products and services.

We may disclose and use personally identifying information in special circumstances where doing so is necessary to enforce our service agreements. For instance, we may invoke this disclosure if doing so will help us protect our intellectual property rights. Hereto, we may also disclose or use your personal information when we believe in good faith that the law requires us to do so.

**What Information RegTOOL Collects**   
The RegTOOL Software does not collect any personally identifying information from your computer. Upon un-installation, RegTOOL does not leave any active or executable data on a customer's computer. A log is left on the hard drive. This log details the items detected and removed by RegTOOL. It is left as a courtesy to our customers and can be manually deleted or used as a future reference by support techs regardless of whether or not those techs are associated with RegTOOL.  


**Updates**   
Once installed, your copy of RegTOOL will routinely check in with our server to receive updates to its threat database. The only data value transmitted to the server at this time is the current version of the installed software. The updating process can be moderated and/or disabled through the settings dialog in the application. By default the updates are retrieved after a notification confirming that an update is available.

**Policy Modifications**   
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be correspondingly posted here, so please check this page periodically. 

If you have any inquiries or concerns regarding this privacy policy, feel free to contact us at [_support@RegTOOL.com_](mailto:support@RegTOOL.com).
