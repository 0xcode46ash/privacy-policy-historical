# Certain Software®, Register123™ Online Event Registration & Meeting Management Solutions : Privacy Policy

**Error:**  

## Privacy Policy

Last Update June, 2005

We at **Certain Software®** are committed to respecting your online privacy and recognize your need for appropriate protection and management of any Personal Information you share with us.

Certain Software has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we use and protect your Personal Information.

Personal Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address, an e-mail address or other contact information. In general, you can visit Certain Software's web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

#### Notice and Disclosure

Third parties provide certain services on Certain Software's behalf. For example, Certain Software contracts with third parties to process payment information. Certain Software may provide information, including Personal Information that Certain Software collects, to such third party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information and services. These third party service providers are obligated to protect your Personal Information on Certain Software's behalf, and to comply with this Privacy Policy.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Register123™ services, we will collect registration information for events. After completing registration, your information is transferred to the event organizer and becomes the responsibility of the meeting planner and event organizer. The registration data that we collect is the property of the contracted organization at all times. Certain Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of meeting planners and event organizers who are our clients. 

For events which require a registration fee, we collect credit card information, including the credit card number, expiration date, and the billing address of the cardholder. This information is transmitted using encryption technologies that insure the privacy of your financial data.

If you choose to provide us with your Personal Information, we may transfer that Personal Information within Certain Software, across borders and from your country to other countries around the world. If you are subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive, laws implementing the Directive, or similar laws, you hereby freely consent to the transfer of your Personal Information outside of the European Union to the United States and other countries and to the use of your Personal Information by Certain Software as described in this Privacy Policy.

Certain Software will only transfer your Personal Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Certain Software's behalf if such transfer is legally required, if necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Certain Software, its customers and/or the public, or to Certain Software's successors-in-interest.

#### Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personal Information to Certain Software. If you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you can still visit most of Certain Software's web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services (such as Register123) that involve our interaction with you.

When we collect your Personal Information, we will provide a means for you to opt-out of Certain Software's sharing your Personal Information with our business partners. Even if you opt-out of such uses, you understand and consent to Certain Software's sharing of your personal information with third party payment processors, solely for the purposes of processing your payment for the Register123 services.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Register123 services we will only send you e-mail messages directly relating to your registration, including:

  * Confirmation of completed registration
  * Notice of incomplete registration
  * Additional information about the event or your registration



We do not allow users to elect not to receive these messages, because they are vital to completing the registration process.

The event organizer has the option of using your personal information, which we provide to them, in order to send you information regarding that event only. Certain Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of event organizers who are its clients.

#### Security

Certain Software is committed to maintaining the security of your Personal Information, and we take reasonable and appropriate precautions to protect the Personal Information that you share with us from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction.

#### Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies

We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.

#### Access / Accuracy

Certain Software is likewise committed to maintaining the accuracy of your Personal Information. You may review your Personal Information by sending us an email request at info@certain.com. Should you discover inaccuracies in your Personal Information, or if you merely wish to update your Personal Information, you may do so by sending corrections and updates to info@certain.com or you may call 888-CERTAIN. You may also contact us to request that we delete your Personal Information.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Register123 services and you provide registration information for an event through Register123, you receive a confirmation code. This code can be used to access or change your information at a later date by sending an e-mail with your full name and confirmation code to the event's customer service representative. This person is listed on the event's online registration form.
