### Privacy Policy for Certain Software, leader in event management software

Certain Software, Inc. is committed to respecting your online privacy and recognizes your need for appropriate protection and management of any Personally Identifiable Information you share with us. Certain Software has established this Privacy Policy so that you can understand how we use and protect your Personally Identifiable Information. Personally Identifiable Information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name, a home or other physical address, an e-mail address or other contact information. In general, you can visit Certain Software's web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information about yourself.

### Notice and Disclosure

Third parties provide certain services on Certain Software's behalf. For example, Certain Software contracts with third parties to process payment information. Certain Software may provide information,including Personally Identifiable Information that Certain Software collects, to such third party service providers to help us deliver programs, products, information and services. These third party service providers are obligated to protect your Personally Identifiable Information on Certain Software's behalf, and to comply with this Privacy Policy.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Certain Meetingsâ„¢ services, we will collect registration information for events. After completing registration, your information is transferred to the event organizer and becomes the responsibility of the meeting planner and event organizer. The registration data that we collect is the property of the contracted organization at all times. Certain Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of meeting planners and event organizers who are our clients.

If you choose to provide us with your Personally Identifiable Information, we may transfer that Personally Identifiable Information within Certain Software, across borders and from your country to other countries around the world. If you are subject to the European Union Data Protection Directive, laws implementing the Directive, or similar laws, you hereby freely consent to the transfer of your Personally Identifiable Information outside of the European Union to the United States and other countries and to the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by Certain Software as described in this Privacy Policy.

Certain Software will only transfer your Personally Identifiable Information without your consent to third parties who are not bound to act on Certain Software's behalf if such transfer is legally required, if necessary to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Certain Software, its customers and/or the public, or to Certain Software's successors-in-interest.

### Choice

You may choose whether or not to provide Personally Identifiable Information to Certain Software. If you choose not to provide the Personally Identifiable Information we request, you can still visit most of Certain Software's web sites, but you may be unable to access certain options, offers and services (such as Certain Meetings) that involve our interaction with you.

When we collect your Personally Identifiable Information, we will provide a means for you to opt-out of Certain Software's sharing your Personally Identifiable Information with our business partners. Even if you opt-out of such uses, you understand and consent to Certain Software's sharing of your Personally Identifiable Information with third party payment processors, solely for the purposes of processing your payment for the Certain Meetings services.

If you decide to use Certain Software's Certain Meetings services we will only send you e-mail messages directly relating to your registration, including:

  * Confirmation of completed registration
  * Notice of incomplete registration
  * Additional information about the event or your registration



We do not allow users to elect not to receive these messages, because they are vital to completing the registration process.

The event organizer has the option of using your Personally Identifiable Information, which we provide to them, in order to send you information. Certain Software is not responsible for the privacy practices of event organizers who are its clients.
