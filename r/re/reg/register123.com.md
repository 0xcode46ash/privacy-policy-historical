Privacy Statement

**Register123.com** has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy on the Internet. 

Personal Information  
We collect registration information for many different events. Depending upon the event, the information that we collect may include the following: name, mailing address, phone number, company name, job title, and e-mail address. 

For events which require a registration fee, we collect credit card information, including the credit card number, expiration date, and the billing address of the card holder. This information is transmitted using encryption technologies (See our security policy), which insures the privacy of your financial data. 

**Please be assured that none of the personal information that you provide, including your e-mail address, will be shared with any third party.** After completing registration, your information is transferred to the event organizer and becomes the responsibility of the meeting planner and event organizer. The registration data that we collect is the property of the contracted organization at all times. Register123.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of meeting planners and event organizers who are our clients. 

Choice/Opt-Out  
We will only send you email messages directly relating to your registration, including; 

  * Confirmation of completed registration 
  * Notice of incomplete registration 

We do not allow users to elect not to receive these messages, because they are vital to completing the registration process. 

The event organizer has the option of using your email address, which we provide to them, in order to send you information regarding that event only. **Register123.com** is not responsible for the privacy practices of event organizers who are its clients. 

Security  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. When you provide registration information to an event through **Register123.com** , you receive a confirmation code. This code can be used to access or change your information at a later date, by: 

  * Sending an email with your full name and confirmation code to the event's customer service representative. This person is listed on the event's online registration form. 

Other information

  * Our site uses cookies (small files stored on your computer) in order to keep track of your registration process.
