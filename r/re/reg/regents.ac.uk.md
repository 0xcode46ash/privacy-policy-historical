"Studying International Relations at Webster Graduate School in London taught me two ways of International Relations: the academic way and the personal way...   In the academic life of International Relations, we learned and analyzed various political theories and their realization; methodologies and ways of research...   In the personal life of International Relations, we learned that it is possible for nearly all ethnicities, friends and enemies, to sit in one class-room, to listen to one professor, to share one lunch-break – suddenly we shared the same interests!  "
