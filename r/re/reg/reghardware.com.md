Register Hardware strongly believes in the importance of keeping readers' personal information personal. It will never use your information for any use beyond that stated or the permissions you give us.

### IP Addresses and Server Logs

The Register Hardware site does record IP addresses and produces server logs - as all Web Servers do. This information is used solely for monitoring the volume of traffic the site receives and measuring the number of readers. We do not use the information for tracking the activities of specific visitors to the site.

### Cookies

The Register Hardware site sets cookies in order to help with the management of its advertising. The data is used by our Advertising Server, purely to help decide which adverts to display on the page at any given time, and for no other purpose beyond this. You may of course choose to block these cookies if you wish, and the site should continue to function normally.

### Advertising

We use a third-party advertising company to serve ads when you visit our Web site. This company may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visit to this Web site in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognise a unique 'cookie' on your browser.
