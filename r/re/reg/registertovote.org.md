# Freeservers.com--Free Web Space

**** Freeservers collects only aggregate information of visitors to its network of sites, including the domain name, visited pages, referring URLs, and other publicly available information. Freeservers uses this information to help improve its Web site and services, and to customize the content of its pages for each individual consumer. 

Freeservers does not sell or commercially make available specific information about its users or members other than in aggregate form, except in cooperation with law enforcement bodies in regards to content violations or violations of applicable laws. Freeservers maintains a database of member information which is used only for internal purposes, such as advertising, collections efforts, technical support, and notifying members of changes or enhancements to the Freeservers service, new services and products that may be of interest to them, and special discounts available to Freeservers members. 

Any Freeservers member may cancel their membership at any time by going to <http://members.freeservers.com/cgi-bin/util/deleteaccount>. When an account is cancelled, all user information is removed from the Freeservers system related to that account, other than that in aggregate form.
