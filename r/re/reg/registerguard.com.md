Privacy statement for registerguard.com  
and other Web sites of Guard Publishing Company. 

The following statement explains how the Web sites published by Guard Publishing Company (including www.registerguard.com) collect and use information obtained during users’ visits to the Web sites. Please note this statement applies only to information collected by Guard Publishing Company online and does not impact information collected or used by Guard Publishing Company or its affiliates through other means. 

We are committed to protecting the privacy of our site visitors and customers.

How we collect information from users 

We may collect information about our site visitors and customers via server logs, cookies, order forms, contests, surveys, and other similar means. Included in this information is personal information that you may provide to us, such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address, and credit card information. 

How your information is used by us 

We do not share personal information we may collect with our advertisers, except in cases in which, at the point of entry for this information, it is clearly stated that it may be shared with advertisers. In these situations, if you do not wish to have your information shared, you should not proceed to enter your information. Other than in situations where you have proceeded to enter personal information after being provided with notice that your personal information may be shared with a third party, the only information we share with advertisers is aggregate information about site usage and demographics.

Wherever there is an opportunity for you to provide us with personal information, we will make an effort to link to this privacy statement so that you will have easy access to review our policies.

To follow are particular examples of types of information obtained by us, or methods used by us to obtain information, along with an explanation of how such information is used.

  * **IP addresses:** We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web sites. Your IP address may be used to help identify you as a unique visitor to our site and to gather broad information about your site usage.
  * **Subscriber Account Registration:** We use personally identifiable information you supply through the Subscriber Services to provide you with the merchandise, product, service, and/or Content you have requested. For example, if you subscribe to any of our publications, we may use your e-mail address to send you a confirmation notice and your mailing address to for location verification. We may also use the information to communicate with you about new features, products or services, and/or to improve the services that we offer by tailoring them to your needs.
  * **Cookies:** Our sites may use cookies to track how many times an ad is delivered (impressions) and how many times it is clicked (click-throughs). Cookies may also be used in tracking of other online activity by our site visitors in order to serve specific advertising within standard ad units (such as behavioral or geographic data). We may share this information in aggregate form with our advertisers. Portions of our site also may use cookies to enable you to keep "favorites" lists, or to save you time in re-entering frequently used information, such as in login procedures. You may be able to opt-out of the cookies delivered by our Web site by changing the setting on your browser. Depending on your privacy settings, please be aware that this may disable all cookies delivered to your browser, not just the ones delivered by our Web sites.
  * **Order Forms:** Our sites use order forms for customers to request information, products, and services. On these forms we may collect your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and other personal information including your credit card information. This information may be used for billing, to process orders, to contact you about your order, and to notify you about subscriber benefits or promotions we may offer.
  * **Contests:** We may run contests on our sites in which we ask customers for information so that we may contact them if necessary regarding the contest. Personal information obtained from contestants is also used to compile aggregate information about site usage and demographics. In some cases, contest entrants will have the option to check additional interest boxes including ones that would provide their contact information to advertisers. This is completely optional.
  * **Surveys:** Our online surveys may ask customers for contact and demographic information. The customer's contact information is used to contact the customer when necessary. Demographic information may be used to tailor our customers' experience at our sites. Survey data may be published on our Web sites and/or in our newspaper, The Register-Guard. It may also be used to develop content and to support marketing for our Web sites or for The Register-Guard. Unique identifiers may be collected and used to verify a customer's identity.
  * **Public Forums:** Our sites may make public forums available to its customers in which you submit comments about specific topics and we post your comments on our Web site. Users should exercise caution when deciding whether to disclose personal information in such areas of our Web sites, and be aware that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Guard Publishing Company and this policy.
  * **Story Referrals:** Many of our news pages include an option to refer the page's content to other people via e-mail. This process requires us to collect and log e-mail addresses of the person referring the story and the person(s) receiving the referral. We use logs of this information to track general patterns of reader usage and to determine which stories are being referred to others. We will not knowingly provide any e-mail addresses collected by us in this process to any third parties for commercial or advertising purposes.

Information Provided to Content Providers and Partners 

In some areas of our Web sites, we have contracted with third party technology or content providers (“Content Providers”) to provide certain information and services to users. Information that is entered in these areas may be provided to the Content Providers, but will only be used by such Content Providers in the course of providing the service requested. An example of a page within our Web sites provided by a Content Provider is The Register Guard Jobs pages, with content provided by Adicio. 

In other areas of our Web sites, we have entered partnerships with other companies (“Partners”) who provide services on co-branded pages. On these pages, the Partner’s brand is clearly visible. We may share data collected on co-branded areas of our site with these Partners, and the Partner’s privacy policy will apply to the Partner’s use of the data collected, which use may be different (and perhaps less restrictive) than our use as described in this privacy statement. The Partner’s privacy policy will be accessible on such co-branded pages, and you are encouraged to read it carefully. An example of a co-branded page of our site is the obituaries pages from Legacy.com.

Disclosures Required by Law or for Security and Safety 

Regardless of your choices with respect to your information, we will disclose personal information when we believe in good faith that such disclosures are (a) required by law, including, for example, to comply with a court order or subpoena, or (b) will help enforce our terms of use, enforce contest and sweepstakes rules, protect your safety or security and/or protect the safety and security of Guard Publishing Company, our Web sites, our property, or our employees; or (c) to protect the safety or security of third parties.
