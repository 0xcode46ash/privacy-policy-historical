# PC Repair Online

This document explains the privacy policy and practices of ReImage.com, a web-based PC maintenance and repair service operated by ReImage, Inc. (“ReImage” or the "Service"). This Policy is part of the Terms of Service for using ReImage. This Policy was last updated on: October 2007. At ReImage, protecting your personal information is an essential part of our Service. This Policy explains what personal information we collect from you, why we collect it and how we use it.

**What Personal Information Do We Collect?**  
Personal information is any information that can be used to identify an individual, such as your name, physical address, contact information (e.g., email address, phone number), title, occupation, and payment card information. Most personal information is gathered at the point of collection, such as on the online Registration Page you use to subscribe to the Service or when you select a particular Service feature.  
We also collect technical information about your computer in order to carry out the ReImage Service. This includes your IP Address, browser type, Inventory Description File (which we create as part of the system scanning process) and your Customer Configuration. Your technical information is associated with your personal account. This information is used to understand what a correct configuration for your computer should look like, what your actual configuration contains, and what files we need to retrieve and install to repair your computer or to carry out other functions of the Service that you have selected.  
_Note_ : We do not make copies of your program or data files on your computer to perform the Service.

**Why Do We Collect the Personal Information?**  
We collect the personal information to set up an account for you, to deliver a product to you, or to carry out a transaction you have requested, including: 

  * Account registration and account related communications
  * To conduct repairs and maintenance on your computer as requested by you
  * To perform archive and restoration activities requested by you
  * To locate and retrieve correct computer files from publicly available sites on your behalf
  * Participation in Discussion Groups
  * Newsletter subscriptions
  * Personalization of the user experience on ReImage
  * Scientific research and improvement of the Service
  * To notify you of our new services or changes to our existing Services
  * To send you technical or service-related communications
  * To enforce the Terms of Service



**How Do We Use Your Personal Information?**  
We will only use your personal information in the way that we described at the time of collection. We will not subsequently change the way your personal information is used without your consent. 

**Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information**  
You may access and change your personal information by using the online Account Management features of the Service. You may delete your account or unsubscribe from certain features (e.g., online newsletters) at any time. Personal information relating to deleted accounts may be archived by the Service according to its normal backup procedures. The Service may retain your Inventory Description File and use it for research and system improvement purposes described in the Terms of Service. Certain information (e.g., online discussion forum postings) may continue to be displayed publicly even if you delete your account.

**Sharing Your Personal Information**  
We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties for marketing purposes unless you have specifically granted us permission to do so. We may share certain personal information with trusted vendors to carry out a transaction you have requested (e.g., sharing card payment information with our credit card processor to obtain payment of fees and to activate your subscription to the Service, or sharing your personal street address with a shipping company to ship you a product that you have purchased).

We may collect and possibly share your personal information to enforce the Terms of Service or to respond to law enforcement inquiries or legal process. This may be done to prevent a crime or violation of our Terms or to help solve a transgression that has been committed.

**Security of Your Personal Information**  
ReImage uses a combination of security features and techniques to safeguard and protect your personal information. For example, your credit card data is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology when transmitted to our card processor. While no security mechanism is absolutely foolproof, we believe our security measures are appropriate for the type of data collected. We recommend that you take precautions when using the Internet and our Service, such as changing your password at regular intervals and using a secure browser.

**Cookies and other Non-Personal Data**  
We use cookies to understand and analyze use of our site, to improve the features and operate more efficiently. Third party advertising servers and exchanges may use cookies with advertisements to track users click-through rates and manage the ads for improved performance. If you disable cookies in our browser, you may not be able to use all the features of the Service. We may use web beacons in our newsletters to count how many times an article is accessed.

**Third Party Websites**  
Our Service may contain links to third party sites. We have no control over the privacy practices of these sites, so you should read their privacy policies to understand their practices. We do not endorse any third party sites.

**Public Forum**  
If you participate in a public forum offered by our Service, remember that postings are public communications and generally cannot be modified or removed once posted. Keep this in mind before posting a public message.

**Children’s Privacy**  
Our Service is not intended to be used by children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13 and we may delete any personal information of a child if we learn it has been posted on our Service.

**Policy Updates**  
We may update this Privacy Policy by posting a new version of it online. Last update: October, 2007.
