| **Our Approach to Privacy. Reunion.com respects your privacy.** Our staff, contractors and others who help us operate our web sites follow this policy on privacy and fair information practices for online activities of Reunion.com.

This Privacy Policy applies to information Reunion.com collects online through its web sites, networks, or other services owned by Reunion.com, Inc. ("Reunion.com") including Reunion.com and other websites operated by us. We refer to these web sites as the "Reunion.com Sites."

While Reunion.com Sites each offer a different combination of services and tools from one site to another, this policy states Reunion.com?s company-wide Privacy Policy with regard to data-collection practices.

By registering as a member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time as discussed below.

 **Overview of Our Policy**  
The security of your personal information is a high priority at Reunion.com. We maintain these web sites and all associated data with technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. No computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard, but Reunion.com is committed to providing reasonable and appropriate security controls to protect our web sites and their information against foreseeable hazards.

The information you provide helps us, and our partners (including our service providers, advertisers and other partners) make the Reunion.com Sites more fun and useful for you. It also enables us to provide you updates about our services and special offers from our partners. When you become a registered member of our site, you may receive email or postal mail from Reunion.com.  If you have so elected, you may also receive email or postal mail from our partners.

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily provide information in public areas of a Reunion.com Site, such as the user profile pages, message boards, or people search, that information can be viewed and possibly used by others, both on the Reunion.com Sites and potentially on our Partners? sites. We advise users not to disclose contact information, including phone number, email address, street address or instant messenger address ("Personally Identifiable information") within these public areas that they do not wish to share.  This information should instead be maintained in the appropriate email and contact information section of this site, which is protected under the terms of this privacy policy. 

**Changes to this Policy**  
This Privacy Policy is available to users on this page for you to read. This Privacy Policy may be updated and modified from time to time to reflect new features, services and options, as well as any other changes with regard to the use of personal information. Users will be notified by a notice on the home pages of the Reunion.com Sites of any significant update to our Privacy Policy. By registering as a member of a Reunion.com Site, you agree to accept this Privacy Policy and are aware that our policy may change over time. Continued use of the Reunion.com Site or other Reunion.com services will signify that you agree to these changes. **About Children**  
Children under 13. The Reunion.com Sites are not directed to children under the age of 13. The Reunion.com Sites prohibits registration by and will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13. This requirement will be posted at points of data collection within the Reunion sites, such as registration for services.

 **Information Collection and Use**  
Below are more details about the information the Reunion.com Sites gather from you and how we use it.

**A. Email Newsletters and Updates.** Reunion.com Sites offer email newsletters and important account activity updates. As part of the Reunion.com service you will receive these updates. If you want to update your email address or stop receiving any of the updates, follow the procedures at the bottom of any newsletter or update we send you.

**B. Membership Registration Information.** When you register for membership on one of our sites, we ask for information about you and your interests. We do this so we can better understand what you like and tailor the site to suit you better. At a minimum, we require your name, birth date, gender, email address and zip code. The more information you volunteer, the more we can tailor the site, updates, and promotions to your interests. We may engage third parties to perform analysis or data processing of our databases that involves access to this information in order to better provide you with the services for which you joined (in which case we will take measures to ensure that such parties are contractually required to keep the information confidential and not to use it other than in a manner that is necessary to perform their work for Reunion.com). 

We may also use or disclose your membership registration or other Personally Identifiable Information as follows:

> * **Service Providers.** We also sometimes offer our members other services provided by third parties. When you register for membership on a Reunion.com Site or activate a service by clicking on a particular service link (e.g., email) on our sites, you may be automatically registered to receive the free services we offer and some of your Personally Identifiable Information may be shared by Reunion.com with those third-party service providers. By becoming a member of the offered service you authorize us and our third-party service providers to send you email updates and information about promotions and special offers. We take care to require that our third-party service providers only use our member?s data as necessary to provide the particular service requested and to give you updates on that service provider?s products and services. 
> * **Co-registration with Other Sites.** As a member, we may offer you the ability to co-register with select third-party partner sites. In some instances where Reunion.com provides co-registration, the co-registration partners allow you to opt-out of their membership. If you choose to co-register with our partners and accept their terms of service, then you are automatically registered as a member of their select web sites and your Personally Identifiable Information is shared with those organizations. As a result, you may receive information from one of these web sites as any of their members would. We advise you to review their privacy and data collection policies for further information. We are not responsible for the use of your Personally Identifiable Information by any such service provider. In order to cancel your membership with any of these partners you will need to go directly to the partner’s site. 
> * **Third Party Search Engines.** When you create and submit a public profile to Reunion.com, you authorize Reunion.com to publicly disclose such information, other than Personally Identifiable information, through the Reunion.com website as well as other third party search engines and websites.
> * **Updates to Personal Information.** When you become a member, other members and third parties may, through use of our 'Reunion.com for Outlook' and other specified services, seek to update their personal contact lists by requesting your personal information, including your Personally Identifiable Information. In some cases, businesses may send us a list of personal information in an attempt to re-contact customers or subscribers whose contact information may have changed. WE WILL NOT PROVIDE YOUR PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION TO THESE OTHER MEMBERS, BUSINESSES OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITHOUT YOUR CONSENT. We will notify you when any such request for your contact information is made, and you will be provided with the option to accept or decline the request. If you do not respond to this request, you will be considered to have declined the request, and your updated contact information will not be provided. 
> 
> In the future, we may provide you with the default option of automatically approving the request of any person, business and/or other third party to update their contact information relating to you so that you do not have to approve or reject each individual request for contact information updates. We will notify you when and if we make this default automatic approval option available. If you elect this default option, your contact information will automatically be provided to each member or third party that requests it through the use of our 'Reunion.com for Outlook' or other specified services. However, you may change your election at any time by changing your preferences.

They may use that information to send you advertisements or other notices, and it is possible that your information may be shared with others.

**F. Surveys and User Research.** Reunion.com conducts email and web-delivered surveys from time to time, as well as instant polls, to gather information about our audience. It is important to remember that taking these surveys and polls is entirely optional. You have no obligation to respond to them. We share only the aggregate results of these surveys, not individual data, with our advertisers and partners to help them better understand our services and monitor the reach of their advertising on our service. We also store some of the information that our users provide in these surveys to help us understand your interests and to make the site more useful for you.

Cookies also enable us to measure the aggregate or total usage and traffic to our site and to specific offerings. This aids us in producing content that best meets our users? preferences. In order to implement new services, we may use other types of cookies as well. We also may use cookies to understand better what parts of our site you like best. We may use that information to display advertisements that we think will be of particular interest to you.
