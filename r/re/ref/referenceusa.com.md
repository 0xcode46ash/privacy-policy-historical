Survey participants are anonymous unless otherwise stated in the survey. infoUSA Inc. reserves the right to perform statistical analyses of visitors behavior and characteristics. In order to measure interest in and use of the various areas of the site and to inform advertisers of such information as well as the number of visitors that have been exposed to or clicked on their advertising banners. infoUSA Inc. will provide only aggregated data from these analyses to third parties. Also, visitors should be aware that infoUSA Inc. may sometimes permit third parties to offer subscription and/or registration-based services through an infoUSA Inc. web site. infoUSA Inc. is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties and visitors should check the applicable privacy policy of such party when providing personally identifiable information. 

Visitors should be aware that when they voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address) on the bulletin boards or in the chat areas of infoUSA Inc. sites, that information, along with any substantive information disclosed in the visitor's communication, can be collected, correlated and used by third parties. This information may result in unsolicited messages from other posters or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of infoUSA Inc.

**Cookies, etc.**

Visitors also should be aware that non-personal information (for example, domain names or e-mail and IP addresses) and data may be automatically collected through the standard operation of infoUSA Inc.'s internet servers or at infoUSA Inc.'s discretion through the use of "cookies." "Cookies" are small text files a web site can use to recognize repeat visitors, facilitate a visitor's ongoing access to and use of the site, track usage behavior and compile aggregate data that will allow content improvements and targeted advertising.
