_Refdesk's Privacy Policy_

Refdesk is committed to protecting the privacy of site visitors and will _never_ give your E-mail address, or any other identifying information about you, to any other person or company for any reason whatsoever.

Refdesk does _not_ gather any personal information about site visitors. If you subscribe to the [Ad-Free version of Refdesk](https://web.archive.org/web/20060614144941id_/http%3A//www.refdesk.com/subscribe.html) , a ['cookie'](http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm) will be used to identify your subscription and to give you access to this service. This subscription 'cookie' information will not be given to anyone. 

Refdesk has one banner-ad atop each page. The text link ads are served by Intermarkets, and the banner ads are served by Tribal Fusion and Fastclick. When you respond to an advertisement, Tribal Fusion, Fastclick or the advertiser may collect certain technical data (type of browser, operating system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when a user has responded to an advertisement, etc.). This type of information is defined by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information "ad delivery and reporting data". _This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes_.

If you want to prevent an advertiser from collecting information, you can visit the [NAI Opt-Out Site](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp) which also allows you to view advertising privacy policies.
