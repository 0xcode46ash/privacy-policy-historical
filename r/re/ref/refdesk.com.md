Refdesk does NOT gather any personal information about our visitors. Refdesk does NOT collect ['cookies'](http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm)

Refdesk has one ad atop each page. This ad is served by refdesk's advertising broker, ValueClick. When you respond to an Internet advertisement served by ValueClick, ValueClick collects certain technical data (Type of Browser, Operating System, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when an Internet consumer has responded to an advertisement, etc.). This type of information is defined by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information "ad delivery and reporting data". This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes.
