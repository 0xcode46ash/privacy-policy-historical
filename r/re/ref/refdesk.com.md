_Refdesk's Privacy Policy_

Refdesk is committed to protecting the privacy of site visitors and will _never_ share your E-mail address with any other person or company.

Refdesk does _not_ gather any personal information about site visitors. Refdesk does _not_ collect ['cookies'](http://www.howstuffworks.com/cookie.htm). 

Refdesk has one banner-ad atop each page. The text link ads are served by Intermarkets, and the banner ads are served by Fastclick. When you respond to an advertisement, Fastclick or the advertiser may collect certain technical data (type of browser, operating system, IP address, domain type, page(s) visited, date and time of when a user has responded to an advertisement, etc.). This type of information is defined by the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/) as Non-Personally Identifiable Information "ad delivery and reporting data". _This means that none of the data can be linked to any individual Internet consumer, and therefore it cannot be used for profiling purposes_.
