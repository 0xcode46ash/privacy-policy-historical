Our sites use online forms for visitors to request information, services, or to register for classes or events. We collect visitors' contact information (i.e., their name, phone number, e-mail addresses, congregation, position held in congregation), unique identifiers (account numbers, passwords), and financial information (account or credit card numbers). Contact information from the online forms is used to send orders and information about our organization to our customers/visitors who request it. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section below). Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services they purchase online. Unique identifiers (such as account numbers or passwords) are collected from website visitors for use as account numbers in our record system.

Information that is collected on online order forms becomes the property of the URJ. The URJ does not sell, market or distribute this information and will not use it for purposes other than indicated in this privacy policy.

Unique identifiers (such as account numbers and passwords) are collected for use as account numbers in our record system. Congregational or account information submitted by users may be used to verify and protect users identity when they are conducting online transactions through our Web site. The URJ may use contact information to distribute news it deems of general interest to Reform Jews. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see the choice/opt-out section).
