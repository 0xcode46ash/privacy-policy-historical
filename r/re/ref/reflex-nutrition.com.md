### Order

For a user who places an order, we request personal information on the order form used in the shopping cart. Contact (name, address, email, etc.) and payment information (credit card number and expiration date) is requested. This information is used for billing purposes and to fill the customer’s order. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact the customer. Credit card transactions are processed using PayPal Internet merchant account and authorized via their payment gateway system. The payment gateway is an authority in trusted modular payment solutions and security systems on the Internet. We do not store credit card details nor do we share customer details with any 3rd parties.

**Cookies  
**We will store a persistent cookie so that you may retrieve the products in your shopping cart with no need to go through re-choosing all of them again. However, the cookie will eventually expire if there is no activity in your cart, e.g. view, add to, etc., for a number of days. This website’s cookies do not contain any personally identifiable information. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, but the user will experience limited functionality in some areas of our site. For example, the user will not be able to process an order through our shopping checkout area.
