# Increase Traffic with Referral Blast: Privacy Policy

The Referral Blast team knows that you care how information about you and your Web site visitors is used and shared, and we appreciate your trust that we will do so carefully and sensibly. This notice describes our privacy policy:

**Is personal information about my Web site visitors or the people they refer publicly used in any way?**

When a visitor clicks on the "Send this site to a friend" button, a pop-up window appears which enables the visitor to enter their name, a specified number of email addresses of people they want to refer to the site (this number depends on the version of Referral Blast in use) and a custom message.  Referral Blast does not harvest these email addresses, nor sell them to third-parties.

**Non-Custom Versions of Referral Blast  
**When referrals are submitted using the pop-up window, the Webmaster of the Referral Blast-enabled Web site may receive a confirmation via email that states the name of the visitor (if that visitor entered his/her name into the pop-up window) and the number of referrals that were made (this is referred to as "Active Monitoring" during the setup process and can be enabled or disabled).  Specific email addresses are not sent to Webmasters of Referral Blast-enabled Web sites.

**Custom Referral Blast  
**Custom Referral Blast is custom-tailored for Web sites that want more control over the look-and-feel of Referral Blast pop-up windows and email text and layout.  Custom Referral Blast can be customized to provide the Webmaster of the Custom Referral Blast-enabled site a duplicate of the Custom Referral Blast message.  Since Custom Referral Blast is only accessible from Web sites that provide a link to it, it is the responsibility of each individual Web site that uses Custom Referral Blast to disclose privacy information to their visitors regarding information collection that may take place as a result of using Custom Referral Blast.

**How is the personal information I provide for credit card processing used?**

During the order process, personal information such as your name, billing address, and credit card information is requested.  This information is used strictly to process your order or to contact you with regard to the product.  It is in no way disclosed, distributed or sold to third parties.

**How secure is information about me?**

  * We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input.
  * We reveal only the last five digits of your credit card number when confirming an order. Of course, we transmit the entire credit card number to the appropriate credit card company during order processing (via SSL encryption).
