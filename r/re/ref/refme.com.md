**Google Analytics**

We use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”) to collect certain information relating to your use of the Site. Google Analytics uses “cookies”, which are text files placed on your computer, to help the Site analyze how users use the site. You can find out more about how Google uses data when you visit our Site by visiting “How Google uses data when you use our partners’ sites or apps”, (located at [www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/)). We may also use Google Analytics Advertising Features to provide you with interest-based advertising based on your online activity. For more information regarding Google Analytics please visit Google’s website, and pages that describe Google Analytics, such as [www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

Please note that if you choose to opt out, you will continue to see ads on our Site, but they will not be based on how you browse and shop.

**Information Collected Through Cookies and Similar Technologies**

We and our service providers use cookies, web beacons, and other technologies to receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Site through your computer or mobile device. A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the Site again, the cookie allows the Site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store unique identifiers, user preferences and other information. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some Site features or services may not function properly without cookies. We use cookies to improve the quality of our service, including for storing user preferences, and tracking user trends.

**No Information from Children Under Age 13**

If you are under the age of 13, please do not attempt to register with us at this Site or provide any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13, please [Contact Us](https://refme.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new).

**3\. HOW WE USE AND SHARE YOUR INFORMATION**

**To Provide Products, Services, and Information.** We collect information from you in order to provide products and services that you purchase using the Site, and to provide information that you request from us. We use your personal information to contact you about your orders, process credit card and debit card transactions, and ship products to you. We may send you promotional materials or advertisements about our products and services, as well as new features and offerings. 

**Sharing with Third Parties.** We may provide information to third party service providers that help us operate and manage our Site, process orders, and fulfill and deliver products and services that you purchase from us and that we provide at no charge. These service providers will have access to your personal information in order to provide these services, but when this occurs we implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to limit their use of that information to helping us provide the service. 

**Your Consent.** In addition to the sharing described elsewhere in this Policy, we will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of RefME when we have your consent to do so. 

**Legal Proceedings.** We will share personal information with third party companies, organizations or individuals outside of RefME if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to: 

  * Meet any applicable law, regulation, subpoena, legal process or enforceable governmental request. 
  * Enforce applicable Terms of Use, including investigation of potential violations. 
  * Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. 
  * Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of RefME, our users, customers or the public as required or permitted by law. 



**Transfer in the Event of Sale or Change of Control.** If the ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes or we otherwise transfer assets relating to our business or the Site to a third party, such as by merger, acquisition, bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, we may transfer or sell your personal information to the new owner. In such a case, unless permitted otherwise by applicable law, your information would remain subject to the promises made in the applicable privacy policy unless you agree differently. 

**Aggregated De-identified Information.** We may also use information from you that we have de-identified by removing your name and any other information that could be used to personally identify you, and which we aggregate and combine with other de-identified information (“De-identified Information”). We may use and share De-identified Information for research and development purposes, product and service development and improvement, marketing and promotional purposes, and other lawful purposes in connection with RefME’s business operations. RefME shall be the exclusive owner of all De-identified Information.

**4\. ACCESS TO YOUR INFORMATION AND CHOICES**

You can access and update certain information we have relating to your online account by logging into your account and going to the “edit account” section. If you have questions about personal information we have about you or need to update your information please feel free to [Contact Us](https://refme.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/requests/new). You can opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional e-mails from RefME by using the opt-out or unsubscribe feature contained in the e-mails. 

You can close your online account by logging into your account and going to the “edit account” section. If you close your account, we will no longer use your online account information or share it with third parties. We may, however, retain a copy of the information for archival purposes, and to avoid identity theft or fraud. 

**5\. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION**

We use industry standard physical, technical and administrative security measures and safeguards to protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information. However, since the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee, ensure, or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. There is no guarantee that information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. It is your responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mails and other communications you send to us through our Site are not encrypted, and we strongly advise you not to communicate any confidential information through these means. 

**6\. CONSENT TO PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA IN UNITED STATES**

Our servers where your personal information is stored are located in Ireland. However, if you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA) please note that in order to provide our Site, products and services to you, we may send and store your personal information (also commonly referred to as personal data) outside of the EEA, including to the United States. Accordingly, your personal information may be transferred outside of the country where you reside or are located, including to countries that may not or do not provide the same level of protection for your personal information. We are committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal information when it is transferred. Where such transfers occur, we take appropriate steps to provide the same level of protection for the processing carried out in any such countries as within the EEA to the extent feasible under applicable law. By using and accessing our Site, users who reside or are located in countries outside of the United States agree and consent to the transfer to and processing of personal information on servers located outside of the country where they reside, and that the protection of such information may be different than required under the laws of their residence or location.

**7\. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY**

Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will not reduce your rights under this Privacy Policy without your consent in accordance with applicable law. We will post any privacy policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we will provide a more prominent notice (including, for certain services, email notification of privacy policy changes). We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
