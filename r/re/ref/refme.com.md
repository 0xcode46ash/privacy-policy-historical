Privacy Policy

Updated 10/10/13

We’ll start by getting a few definitions out of the way that should help you understand this policy. When we say "we," "us," and "RefME,” we’re referring to RefME LTD, a England and Wales limited company. When we say “you” or “Member,” we’re referring to the person or entity that’s registered with us to use the Services. 

We provide online platforms that you may use to create, send, and manage references (the “Services”). We offer the Services on our website http://www.refme.co, and in our Apps, RefME. In the course of providing the Services, we may collect Personal Information, which means information about a Member. A "Project List" is a list of ISBN, ISSN numbers that one of our Members has created, or intends to export, use, and all information relating to the ISBN and ISSN numbers. 

If there are any changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll post them on the Website and send them to the last email address you gave us. Any changes will be effective as of the date we post on the Website or send the email (or whichever date is later). You may object to any changes within 20 days after they’re posted on our Website or delivered to you, in which case none of the proposed changes will be effective with respect to information that we’ve already collected from you, but will apply only to information we collect in the future. We won't treat information of any open account differently from any other open account. If you object to changes in our Privacy Policy, we’ll have to terminate your account. That said, if we ever changed our Privacy Policy to expand our rights to use or disclose Personal Information for marketing purposes, you‘d be able to opt out without termination.

This Privacy Policy is effective with respect to any data that we’ve collected, or collect, about and/or from you, according to our Terms of Use.

If you have any questions or comments, or if you want to update, delete, or change any Personal Information you’ve submitted on the Website, please use our contact form to get in touch. You may also contact us by postal mail at: RefME Privacy Department Unit 7, 11 Plough YardLondon, EC2A 3LP 

Information You Provide to Us: When you register to use the Services, communicate with our customer service team, send us an email, or post on our blog, you’re giving us information that we collect. That information may include your IP address, name, physical address, email address, phone number, and other details like gender, occupation, education and other demographic information. By giving us this information, you consent to your information being collected, used, disclosed, and stored by us, only as described in our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy. List and Project Information: When you add Project List or create a reference with the Services, we have access to the data on your list and the information in your reference. 

Information from your Use of the Service: We may get information about how and when you use the Services. This information may include your IP address, time, date, browser used, and actions taken by you within the application.

Cookies: When you register to use RefME, we store "cookies," which are strings of code, on your computer. We use those cookies to collect information about when you visit our Website, when you use the Services, your browser type and version, your operating system, and other similar information. You may turn off cookies that have been placed on your computer by following the instructions on your browser, but if you block our cookies, it may be more difficult (and maybe even impossible) to use the Services. When you play one of the videos on the Websites, the Flash player may use local shared objects, which are also called Flash cookies. We don’t use these Flash cookies for anything, but we can’t stop the player from dropping them (we tried). 

Web Beacons: When we send emails to registered RefME customers, we'll sometimes track who opened the emails and who clicked the links. We do that to measure our Email Campaigns’ performance and to improve our features for specific segments of customers. To do this, we include single pixel gifs, also called web beacons, in emails we send. Web beacons allow us to collect information about when you open the email, your IP address, your browser or email client type, and other similar details. We also include Web Beacons in the emails we deliver for you. We use the data from those Web Beacons to create the reports you see about who has or hasn’t opened emails or clicked links. Reports are also available to us when we send you email, so we may collect and review that information.

Information from Other Sources: We may get more information about you, like name, age, and participation in social media websites, by searching the internet or querying third parties (we’ll refer to that information as Supplemental Member Information). We only collect data that’s publicly available or provided by a third party according to its terms of use.

Supplemental Member Information. We use this “Supplemental Member Information” to develop features that helps you learn about your references and send them more relevant content.

We may use and disclose your Personal Information only as follows:

  * To promote use of our Services. For example, if you leave your Personal Information when you visit our Website and don’t sign up for any of the Services, we may send you an email asking whether you want to sign up. And if you use any of our Services, and we think you might benefit from using another Service we offer, we may send you an email telling you about it. 
  * To send you System Alert Messages. For example, we may let you know about temporary or permanent changes to our Services, like planned outages, new features, version updates, releases, abuse warnings, and changes to our Privacy Policy.
  * To enforce compliance with our Terms of Use and applicable law. This may include developing tools and algorithms that help us prevent violations.
  * To provide customer support.
  * To protect the rights and safety of our Members and third parties, as well as our own.
  * To meet legal requirements like complying with court orders and valid subpoenas.
  * To provide information to representatives and advisors, like attorneys and accountants, to help us comply with legal, accounting, or security requirements.
  * To prosecute and defend a court, arbitration, or similar proceeding.
  * To support and improve the Services we offer. This includes adding features that compare References, or using data to suggest other References you may be interested in.
  * To communicate with you about your account for informational, not promotional, reasons.
  * To transfer your information in the case of a sale, merger, consolidation, or acquisition. In that event, any acquirer will be subject to our obligations under this Privacy Policy.
  * To send you informational and promotional content that you may choose (or "opt in") to receive. You can stop receiving our promotional emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in every email.



Tools and Algorithms Our Data Scientist analyze project lists and references to find trends in the data. That information helps us keep the evil spammers out.

Unsubscribe Links It’s the law! Unsubscribe links are required by theCAN-SPAM act. Plus, making it easy for people to opt out is the nice thing to do.

Blog. We have public blogs on our Websites. Any information you include in a comment on our blog may be read, collected, and used by anyone. If your Personal Information appears on our blogs and you’d like it to be removed, contact us here. If we’re not able to remove your information, we’ll let you know why. Social Media Widgets. Our Websites include social media features, like the Facebook Like button. These features may collect information about your IP address and which page you’re visiting on our site, and they may set a cookie to make sure the feature functions properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our site. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of the companies that provide them. 

Links to Third-Party Sites. Our Websites include links to other websites, whose privacy practices may be different from RefME’s. If you submit Personal Information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy policies. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any Website you visit.

Your Project lists are stored on a RefME server. Only authorized employees have access to view Project Lists. You may export (download) your lists from RefME at any time, as long as we have a copy. We’ll use and disclose the information in your Project Lists only for the reasons listed under Use of Your Personal Information, except the following. (In other words, we will not use and disclose the information in your Distribution Lists to): send you system alert messages; communicate with you about your account; or send you informational and promotional content. 

It’s worth repeating: We respect your privacy. We’d never sell your personal information.

Nobody’s safe from hackers. If a security breach causes an unauthorized intrusion into our system that materially affects you, then RefME will notify you as soon as possible and later report the action we took in response.

RefME accounts require a username and password to log in. You must keep your username and password secure, and never disclose it to a third party. Account passwords are encrypted, which means we can’t see your passwords. We can’t resend forgotten passwords either. We’ll only reset them.

We do our best to keep your data accurate and up to date, to the extent that you provide us with the information we need to do that. If your data changes (like a new email address), then you’re responsible for notifying us of those changes.

We only store data about you for as long as it’s reasonably required to fulfill the purposes that gave us the right to access it in the first place. We keep some data indefinitely, relating to when and where scans were made, which failed, because we use it to create better references, and for other reasons explained in this policy.

We’ll give you access to any Personal Information about you that we hold within 30 days of any request for that information you make by emailing legal@refme.co. Unless it’s prohibited by law, we’ll remove any Personal Information about you from our servers at your request.

We regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. If we receive a written complaint, then we’ll respond to the person who made it.

Thanks for taking the time to learn about RefME’s privacy policy, and thanks for trusting us to handle your email.
