# Remember The Milk - Privacy Policy

Remember The Milk is a free, to-do list management service. This policy describes the types of personal information we may collect and how we use it to provide the Remember The Milk service.

By using Remember The Milk, you agree to the collection and use of your personal information as described in this policy. You should know:

  * We collect limited account information and store and maintain your account and to-do list contents on our secure servers.
  * We will never rent, sell or share information that personally identifies you for marketing purposes without your express permission.
  * You can update your account information and preferences at any time.



To comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, at this time Remember The Milk is only available to users who are at least 13 years old. If you are under 13, please do not use the Remember The Milk service.

## What types of personal information do we collect and how do we use it?

_Account information_. When you register with Remember The Milk, we will request some personal information, including your first and last name, email address, a username, and password to create your account. Your password will be maintained on our system in an encrypted form.

_To-do list contents and usage_. The contents of your Remember The Milk account are stored and maintained on Remember The Milk servers in order to provide the service. Because we keep back-up copies of data for the purposes of recovery from errors or system failure, residual copies of to-do list contents may remain on our systems for some time, even after you have deleted information or after the termination of your account. Remember The Milk employees do not access the content of any to-do lists unless you specifically request them to do so (for example, if you are having technical difficulties accessing your account) or if required by law, to maintain our system, or to protect Remember The Milk or the public.

We also may collect information about the use of your account, such as how much storage you are using, how often you log in and other information related to your registration and use of Remember The Milk. Information displayed or clicked on in your Remember The Milk account (including UI elements, links, and other information) is also recorded. We use this information internally to deliver the best possible service to you, such as improving the Remember The Milk user interface.

Remember The Milk will never sell, rent or share your personal information with any third parties for marketing purposes without your express permission.

## Cookies & log information.

_Cookies_. A cookie is a small data file that is sent to your computer when you first visit a website. As with most website cookies, our cookies include an identification number that is unique to the computer you are using. This identifier helps us better understand our user base and how they are using our site and services.

When you visit Remember The Milk and create a Remember The Milk account, we set and access cookies on your computer. We use cookies for a number of reasons, such as recognizing you when you visit the site, displaying the site according to your chosen user settings for language, and maintaining the security of your account. We may also use the cookies to collect aggregated information about the use of Remember The Milk to maintain, analyze and improve the service. If you set your browser so that it refuses cookies, you will not be able to use the Remember The Milk service.

_Log information_. When you use your Remember The Milk account, we collect certain information (the same information that most web sites log when they are accessed). This information, contained in the "header" of your request to access the Remember The Milk page, usually includes the browser type you used, your Internet Protocol address, and the date and time of day. In addition, we log the unique ID provided by our cookie and the URL of the last site you visited.

As a basic matter, we need this information to help us provide our services to you. For example, we need to validate your identity in order to maintain the security of your to-do lists. We also need to know what Internet Protocol address your query came from so we can send the appropriate pages back to you.

In addition, we log this information for internal business purposes. For example, this log information helps us determine how well our services are working so we can continually improve the quality of Remember The Milk. The log information is also important for security, audit, quality improvement, and other internal business purposes.

## How we may contact you.

Remember The Milk may send you information related to your Remember The Milk account or Remember The Milk services. Because we believe such information is important, you will not be given the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

## Transfer of information.

Personal information collected by Remember The Milk may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Remember The Milk maintains facilities. By using Remember The Milk, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.

We reserve the right to transfer your personal information in the event of a transfer of ownership of Remember The Milk, such as acquisition by or merger with another company. In such an event, Remember The Milk will notify you before information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Updating your information.

You can change your Remember The Milk account settings at any time in the "Settings" section of your account.

You can terminate your account at any time, by going to the account information page. You should be aware, however, that residual copies of information may remain stored on our systems even after the deletion of information or the termination of your account.

We hope you will enjoy using Remember The Milk.
