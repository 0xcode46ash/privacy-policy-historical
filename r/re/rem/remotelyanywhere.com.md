Generally, you can browse through our website without giving us any information about yourself. When we do need your personal information to provide services that you request or when you choose to provide us with your personal information, this policy describes how we collect and use your personal information.

Information Collection

As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your internet browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site might not work without cookies.

Notice: When personal information is collected, we will inform you at the point of collection the purpose for the collection. We will always give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving direct marketing or market research information. This means we assume you have given us your consent to collect and use your information in accordance with this Policy unless you take affirmative action to opt out at the point of collection. Opt-out is the means by which you give us, or decline to give us, your consent to use your personal information for the purposes covered by the opt-out choice. In some cases, when applicable, we will provide you with the opportunity to "opt in". This means we will require your affirmative action to indicate your consent before we use your information for purposes other than the purpose for which it was submitted.
