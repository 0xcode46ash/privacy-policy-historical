This Privacy Policy is specific to Remington Outdoor Company, Inc. d/b/a Freedom Group, Inc. and its affiliates and subsidiaries (the “Freedom Group” or “We”) located in the United States.  As part of our [Terms and Conditions of Use,](https://web.archive.org/pages/our-company/our-company/terms-of-use.aspx) this Privacy Policy governs your visit to this website and any other website owned and operated by Freedom Group (the "Sites”). Review our Privacy Policy from time to time as we may update or change this Privacy Policy at any time for any reason without notice to you. By using this Site, you indicate your assent to all of the terms of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions of Use. If you do not agree with any term of this Privacy Policy or the Terms and Conditions of Use, do not use this Site or submit any Personal Information. 

**Information We Collect**  
We do not collect Personal Information unless you voluntarily provide it to us. “Personal Information” is data that can be used to uniquely identify or contact a single person. If you wish to participate in some of the features and services the Sites may offer, we may ask you to provide certain Personal Information. We reserve the right to transfer any information, including Personal Information, in the event all, or a portion, of the business or assets of Freedom Group are sold or transferred, including in connection with a sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of assets, reorganization or liquidation of our business. 

If you sign up for an electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to “unsubscribe” from that list. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive future materials from us.

**Cookies and Other Software**

We may use cookies, beacons or other visit recognition software to improve the use and functionality of our Sites. A cookie is a small data file sent to your browser from a Web server to be stored on your hard drive that may allow easier access the next time the same page is visited. You can configure your browser to reject cookies by modifying your browser settings, but if your browser settings do not accept cookies from us, then some functions of the Sites may not operate as intended.

**What We Share With Others**

We may use or disclose your Personal information to affiliates and third-party partners in certain joint promotional and marketing programs, to manage databases of customer information, to assist us in distributing emails, to manage the site, or to take precautions against liability.  We may disclose information to outside companies that help us bring you the products and services we offer, in connection with any services or products you purchase from us, to your credit card issuer, credit reporting and fraud checking agencies. We reserve the right to disclose any Personal Information requested by law enforcement agencies or if we are required to do so by law, regulation, subpoena, court order, or by a government entity.

**Protecting Your Privacy**   
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect online.  All of our websites that collect information will process and store that information in databases located in the United States. 

**Third-Party Sites** ****

This Website may link you to other sites on the Internet which are not under the control of the Freedom Group, including several sites operating under license and displaying the Freedom Group® brand. You acknowledge that Freedom Group is not responsible for the accuracy, or any other aspect of the content of sites it does not operate or control, including those operated by International licensees. Your accessing the links to any other sites is at your own risk and subject to the applicable privacy policies and terms and conditions of such websites.

**Children’s Privacy  
**The Sites are not intended for children under the age of 18. The Freedom Group does not knowingly solicit or collect Personal Information from children under 18. If you are under the age of 18, please do not submit your e-mail address or any other personal information to us through the Sites. ****

The Freedom Group encourages parents to go online with their children. Parents should understand the sites their kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. There are parental control tools available such as browsers and filtering software that prevent children from accessing inappropriate sites. 

**Updating Information**  
You can help the Freedom Group maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying us of any changes to your address, phone number or e-mail address. If you have previously given your personal information to us and no longer want to be contacted via e-mail, please contact us. If at any time you wish to stop receiving an electronic newsletter you can unsubscribe as explained in the newsletter.

If you have previously given your personal information to us through our online magazine and no longer want to be contacted via e-mail, please unsubscribe using the link at the bottom of the e-mail. 

If you need assistance in updating your information, please contact us. To aid our processing of your request, please include your contact information, the name of the service to which you register or to which you need the changes applied, and the details of the change (e.g., update email address, unsubscribe from a newsletter).

If you sign up to receive mobile messaging (e.g., SMS and MMS) offers and communications but later decide you no longer wish to receive them, simply follow the opt-out instructions included in the mobile message.  Because customer lists generally are prepared well in advance of a communication you may continue to receive some offers after you send us a request not to use your information for specified marketing purposes.
