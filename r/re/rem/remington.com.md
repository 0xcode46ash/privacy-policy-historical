# On-line Privacy Policy

**

Remington Arms Company, Inc.  
On-line Privacy Policy

**

Your right to on-line privacy is of utmost importance. We recognize that when you choose to disclose information about yourself, you trust Remington to act in a responsible manner. We believe this information should only be used to help us provide you with better service. That's why we have put a policy in place to better explain how we protect your personal information.

This policy covers Remington’s family of corporate and subsidiary web sites, which include [www.remington.com](http://www.remington.com/), [www.stren.com](http://www.stren.com/), and [www.rempac.org](http://www.rempac.org/). By visiting these sites you are under no obligation to provide any information to Remington except when necessary to receive requested products or services. We encourage you to take the time to read this privacy policy and those of any web site you visit.

We are committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. As part of our commitment to your privacy we have outlined what information we gather from our web site users and how we use that information. Below is a summary of Remington’s on-line privacy policy.

****

**Information we collect**  
In general, when you visit our web sites and access information you remain anonymous. Before we ask you for information, we will explain how this information will be used. We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission.

There are occasions where we will ask for additional information. We do this to be able to better understand your needs, to adjust our web site to your personal preferences, to send to you via e-mail or postal mail newsletters, new product announcements or other information that we feel may be of value to you, and for other similar business purposes. Some examples of information our web sites collect are name, address, e-mail address and the services that you request. We give you the opportunity to elect not to receive future materials from us. If you sign up for a Remington electronic newsletter or e-mail list, each message will include instructions on how to "unsubscribe" from that list.

All opinions, ideas, suggestions, and other feedback submitted through our web sites may be used by Remington, without any restriction and free of charge, and nothing contained in this policy shall limit or otherwise affect this.

Please note that Remington will fully cooperate with any court order or other legal process and will provide your personal information to the extent required in any legal proceeding.

****

**Protecting your privacy**  
Remington will take appropriate steps to protect your privacy. We will also take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information in storage. Access to personally identifiable information is limited only to individuals needing such access to perform their job function. All of our web sites that collect information will process and store that information in databases located in the United States.

We will not provide any of your personal information to other companies or individuals without your permission. However, we may need to provide your name and delivery address to third parties that Remington uses for the purposes of delivering specific services to you (e.g., a shipping company or fulfillment house if you have asked us to send something to you).

Our web sites do provide links to third party sites. Since we do not control those web sites, we encourage you to review the privacy policies posted on these third party sites and any other sites that you visit. Additionally, the existence of any hyperlink does not imply that Remington endorses the linked company, product or service.

****

**Children's privacy**  
None of the web sites covered by this policy knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under age 13. If we discover that a child under the age of 13 has provided us with any personally identifiable information, we will delete that information from our systems.

Remington encourages parents to go online with their children. Parents should understand the sites their kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. There are parental control tools available such as browsers and filtering software that prevent children from accessing inappropriate sites. Children should never give out personal information on the Internet, such as name, address, phone number, or name of school, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Look for a privacy policy on a web site and find out how information collected from children is treated. Parents should teach their children to look for sites that display a privacy policy.

****

**Use of cookies**  
Remington’s web sites use cookies for various reasons. Cookies enable us to provide you with a better experience by allowing us to understand what areas of the web site are of interest to our visitors. This information gathered in our log files is not linked to any personally identifiable information and only utilized for aggregate statistics.

Remington also uses cookies when you submit a question through our on-line help center. In this situation, a cookie will store useful information that enables our web site to remember you when you return to visit us. Remington can only read cookies from Remington web sites. If you choose to disable cookies in your browser, you can still access most of our web sites.

**Updating information**  
You can help Remington maintain the accuracy of your information by notifying Remington of any changes to your address, phone number or e-mail address.
