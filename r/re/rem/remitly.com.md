The TRUSTe program covers information collected through this Website, www.remitly.com and does not cover information that may be collected through our mobile applications. TRUSTe's mission, as an independent third party, is to accelerate online trust among consumers and organizations globally through its leading privacy trustmark and innovative trust solutions.

This Policy explains what personal information we collect about you, with whom we share it, and how you can elect in certain situations to not share information with third parties. “Personal Information” refers to information such as name and email that can be used to identify you individually.

We may amend this Policy at any time, and whenever we do so we will notify you by posting a revised version on the Website. If, however, we plan to make a material change in the way we collect, use or store your personal information, we will provide prior notice on our website, and by email. You will then have the chance to decide whether or not we will use or disclose your information in that new manner, whether though an “opt-out” procedure or by ending your relationship with us. Such changes will become effective, at the earliest, 30 days after the date of the email notifications.

We ask that minors refrain from using our Service or submitting any personal information to us. Minors (those under the age of 18 years) are not eligible to use our Service.

Federal and state laws allow you to restrict the sharing of your personal information in certain instances. However, these laws also state that you cannot restrict all types of sharing.

  * You may opt-out from promotional emails to you by accessing your email preferences or selecting the “Unsubscribe” function present in each email we send you.



Our Android and Apple mobile applications allow Senders and Recipients to communicate via text messages (“Messaging”). Messaging is intended for use by Remitly customers in conjunction with money transfers. Information within and about these messages is subject to these same privacy guidelines. As such, we will only share that information with third parties for the purpose of processing the messages or when it may be subject to formal legal process, including a valid warrant or solicitation by law enforcement. We might also use the information to investigate compliance with our Service Restrictions, including suspected illegal activity.
