**General Information**

    * When you register or post a comment, we ask for your email address.

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, which is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

    * You can configure your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set.  
    * If you reject all cookies, you will not be able to use Remodelista products or services that require you to "sign in," and you may not be able to take full advantage of the Remodelista service.  
    * Remodelista uses its own cookies for a number of purposes, including to:

Other entities' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other entities do not have access to Remodelista's cookies. 

**Information Sharing and Disclosure**

    * Any personal information or content that you voluntarily disclose online (on message boards, in reviews and discussion areas, and within your public profile page, etc.) becomes publicly available and can be collected and used by others.   
   *  Your email address and any other information you volunteer when sharing a Design File may be displayed to those users when they access your Design File.   
    * We do not use your email address or other personally identifiable information to send marketing messages unless you've opted in to receive such messages. We may, however, use your email address without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Remodelista Site changes, alerting you to messages from other Remodelista members, or for customer service purposes).  
    * We use both your personally identifiable information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of Remodelista.com and to create new features, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends.

    * It may be necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities, including without limitation, fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Remodelista's terms of use, or as otherwise permitted or required by law. We will transfer information about you if Remodelista is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Remodelista will notify you by email or by putting a prominent notice on the Remodelista website before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. Remodelista may share demographic information with business partners, such as "53% of users who regularly user Remodelista are between 18 and 24" or the like. No personally identifiable information will ever be used without your permission (i.e. we will ask you for a quote or testimonial)  
    * We may release personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law) or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant.  
    * Remodelista also reserves the right to disclose personally identifiable information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Remodelista believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Member Agreement, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of our website, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Remodelista, our users or others.
