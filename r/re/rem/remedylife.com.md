This Privacy Policy applies to consumers who have agreed to receive promotional emails from MediZine, LLC ("MediZine").  By continuing to receive such promotional emails, you consent to the collection and use of information by MediZine as outlined in this Privacy Policy. 

MediZine practices permission-based marketing, and is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy.  This Privacy Policy will help you understand how and the extent to which MediZine collects, uses and safeguards the Personal Information (defined below) that you have provided.  

**Personal Information MediZine Collects From You**

If you are receiving MediZine publications and promotional email messages, this is due to your having returned a business reply card to MediZine upon which you included certain Personal Information (defined below) and indicated your interest in receiving such communications.  For purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" shall mean information that can be used to identify you, including, but not limited to: (a) a first and last name; (b) a home or other physical address, including street name and name of city or town; (c) an e-mail address; or (d) a telephone number.

**How MediZine Uses Personal Information**

MediZine may use your Personal Information to send email communications to you, including email communications sent on behalf of its advertisers and other partners.  If you indicated your interest in receiving health or medical information from third parties, then MediZine may share your Personal Information with such third parties.  MediZine does not share your Personal Information with any third parties other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy.  MediZine may use your Personal Information for internal business purposes, such as performing market analysis and analyzing and managing its business.

MediZine may provide subscriber information in aggregate, de-identified form (i.e., in a manner that the data cannot be traced back to you) to its advertisers and other parties. 

MediZine may, in its sole discretion, share or transfer your Personal Data where permitted or required by law, to comply with legal process (for example, MediZine may disclose your information as necessary to comply with an authorized civil, criminal or regulatory investigation), to protect the security or integrity of its databases or the Website, to protect MediZine’s business or reputation, to take precautions against legal liability, in the event of a business transition (see below), to protect and defend the rights or property of MediZine, for required institutional risk control, or for resolving disputes, inquiries or complaints with respect to your use of the Website.

MediZine may also employ other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on its behalf. Examples include sending direct and electronic mail, information technology support, maintaining and removing duplicate information from user lists, analyzing data and providing marketing analysis. The agents performing these limited functions on MediZine’s behalf shall have access to its users’ Personal Information as needed to perform their functions for MediZine but are not permitted to use your Personal Information for other purposes.  All MediZine contractors operate under federal and state laws regarding consumer privacy.

Business Transitions

In the event MediZine goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your Personal Data might be among the assets transferred.

The first time a user provides an e-mail address in connection with their activities at the Website, MediZine assigns an identification number to that e-mail address and deploy a cookie to the applicable user's PC. Whenever that user comes back to the Website using the same PC, the cookie allows the Website to identify the user and to recall the user's e-mail address. If, at any time, a user provides other information in connection with their activities on the Website (such as name, address, birth date, gender, etc.), MediZine may store that information, along with the user's e-mail address, in its user database. MediZine may use the information stored in its database: (i) to effectuate the purpose or transaction for which the information was originally provided by a user; (ii) to pre-populate information fields in the event a user wishes to purchase products and/or services or sign up for and/or subscribe to services, promotions or other offers in the future; (iii) to ensure that a user will not be repeatedly exposed to the same advertisements, offers and/or promotions while visiting the Website; and/or (iv) to, in connection with regular communication with a user, include offers, promotions or advertisements that were historically, or are likely to be, of interest to that user. MediZine also may use cookies to anonymously track and target the interests of our users to further enhance the experience on the Website.

Action Tags, Web Beacons and other Data Collection Methods: An action tag or a web-beacon (also known as a clear gif or a pixel tag) is a method used to track responses or actions by visitors who view certain advertisements or other information on a Site. Action tags are 1x1 pixel images embedded in a website page that are used to transparently collect information. MediZine may use action tags to count the number of times that visitors click on a particular banner ad or visit the pages of our Sites and to provide information about what products are viewed or purchased. MediZine reserves the right to retain this cookie and action tag data indefinitely. At no time will MediZine share cookie-related, action-tag-related and/or generated information and/or data with third parties.

**Security Precautions**

MediZine strives to protect the privacy and security of the data it collects and maintains.  MediZine (including through its contractors) maintains reasonable physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect the confidentiality of your Personal Data.  MediZine keeps your Personal Data only for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes for which it was collected or to comply with any applicable legal or ethical reporting or document retention requirements.
