## Accessing & Editing Your Information

Remote Year provides you with the ability to view, update, access, edit and correct your Personal Information by contacting our Onboarding team at welcome@remoteyear.com (if your program has not yet launched), by contacting your program leaders (if your program has launched), or by contacting citizens@remoteyear.com (if you’re a Remote Year Citizen). Personal Information transmitted through boards, chats, polls or any other means may remain in our databases, except to the extent prohibited under applicable law.

You may have additional rights under applicable law to access information we hold or share about you but any access request may be subject to a reasonable fee, to the extent permissible under applicable law, to meet our costs in providing you with details of such information.

## Children's Privacy

The Services are designed for adults only and are not available to children (i.e. persons who are under 18 years of age) or users who have had their user account temporarily or permanently deactivated. By becoming a user, you represent and warrant that you are an adult and that you have the right, authority and capacity to enter into and abide by the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to verify your information and can exercise our absolute discretion not to provide any Services to you if we are not satisfied that you are an adult. If a child has provided us with Personal Information, a parent or legal guardian of that child may contact us as described below. Upon confirmation, we will then make reasonable efforts to delete the child’s Personal Information from our applicable database.

##  **NOTICE FOR RESIDENTS OF THE EU, UK, LICHTENSTEIN, NORWAY, OR ICELAND**

If you are a resident of the European Union (“EU”), United Kingdom, Lichtenstein, Norway, or Iceland, you may have additional rights under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) with respect to your Personal Data, as outlined below.
