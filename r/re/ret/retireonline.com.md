Web Security and You

Protecting your privacy and security is a shared responsibility. We affirm our commitment to safeguard your personal information; however, it is imperative that you protect your Personal Access Code to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you do not share your Personal Access Code with anyone. If you do choose to give it to someone, such as a so-called "financial aggregator" that combines information about you from multiple sources over the Internet, you do so at your own risk. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur as a result. Registration is the unique User ID and Personal Access Code combination used to log in to a secure and customized My Accounts Homepage containing your JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services accounts and other services. Any personal or financial information you provide during the Registration process is kept confidential, as stated in this Privacy and Security Policy.

To help protect your personal information, JPMorgan Retirement Plan Services employs the following security mechanisms when setting up a Registration account.

| The Personal Access Code cannot begin with a zero.

A timeout feature will automatically end your secure session if you are not active for 30 minutes. To restart your Registration session, you will need to log in again. After three failed attempts to log in, we lock the account to prevent access to personal information within the Web site.
