Web Security and You

Protecting your privacy and security is a shared responsibility. We affirm our commitment to safeguard your personal information; however, it is imperative that you protect your Password to prevent unauthorized access to your accounts. For this reason, we strongly suggest that you do not share your Password with anyone. If you do choose to give it to someone, such as a so-called "financial aggregator" that combines information about you from multiple sources over the Internet, you do so at your own risk. We cannot be responsible for any losses you may incur as a result. Registration is the unique User Name and Password combination used to log in to a secure and customized Personal Homepage containing your J.P. Morgan|American Century accounts and other services. Any personal or financial information you provide during the Registration process is kept confidential, as stated in this Privacy and Security Policy.

To help protect your personal information, J.P. Morgan|American Century employs the following security mechanisms when setting up a Registration account.

You will receive or have received a secured Password in the mail. Any time you visit the site, you have the option of changing that Password. The requirements for the new Password are that it:

| must be a unique number six-to 10- digits long  
---|---  
  
| cannot contain letters or special characters  
  
| must not have more than two repeating numbers  
  
| must not have more than two increments  
  
| must not have more than two decrements  
  
| must not contain a string of four or more numbers that match your Social Security Number and  
  
| cannot begin with a zero  
  
A timeout feature will automatically end your secure session if you are not active for 30 minutes. To restart your Registration session, you will need to log in again. After three failed attempts to log in, we lock the account to prevent access to personal information within the Web site.

If you forgot your Password or locked your account, J.P. Morgan|American Century can help to re-establish your Internet session. Call 1-800-345-2345 to have your Password immediately reset or to have a new Password sent by postal mail the next business day. Our representatives can be reached Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 7 p.m.

   Web Browser Requirements 

|   
  
---|---  
  
We require users to access their accounts online with Netscape Navigator (version 4.07 or later), Microsoft Internet Explorer (version 4.0 or later) or AOL (for Windows 3.0 or later). These browsers use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with RSA Public Key encryption. This technology helps enable the security of your online sessions. If for any reason your session is no longer secure, you will be disconnected from online account access.

If a session is secure, it means that it is encrypted. Every secure page on J.P. Morgan|American Century's Web site has been secured with a digital certificate by RSA Data Security, Inc. We use SSL, RSA Public Key encryption and proprietary encryption algorithms to secure your connection when you are accessing your account online. J.P. Morgan|American Century supports 128-bit encryption to provide you with secure access to your account information.

However, your browser may only support 40-bit encryption. If your browser does not support 128-bit encryption, we recommend that you upgrade your browser to a newer version. Please access the Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer Web sites to upgrade your browser to the current version with 128-bit encryption.

Before making an upgrade to your company’s proprietary PC, be sure to check with your computer help desk to learn about software upgrade policies.
