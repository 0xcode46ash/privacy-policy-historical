# RetailChoice.com - Privacy Policy

At RetailChoice.com, we make every effort to comply with our obligations under the 1998 Data Protection Act.

Additionally, we understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your CV and Profile, and other information you may give us while using the site. You can amend or delete any of the information that RetailChoice.com stores about you by logging in to ‘My Profile’ or by contacting us at [admin@retailchoice.com](mailto:admin@retailchoice.com) with your request.

RetailChoice.com is hosted by a third party - Madgex Ltd.

**Profile and CV information**  
Contact and other details you supply as part of the registration process are stored by us and used to provide you with the information you have requested.

When you complete your RetailChoice.com profile, it may be made available for searching, viewing over the Internet and downloading by RetailChoice.com's customers. Customers that request details of candidates with your type of profile may be sent your profile by email.

These may be direct recruiters, employment consultants or other organisations.

Your CV can be uploaded as part of an online application. Therefore this will be sent to the employer that you choose to send it to. The CV will be kept electronically by us, and may be viewed by employers.

When registering your profile, you can choose to prevent our customers from accessing your personal details and profile.

IMPORTANT: Your current employer may be a customer of RetailChoice.com, or a client of one of our consultancy customers. RetailChoice.com cannot restrict the customers who access profiles on our database and cannot be held responsible for any eventuality. As part of the registration process RetailChoice.com offers you the option of remaining anonymous.

RetailChoice.com will also use the aggregate data to identify trends, such as salary averages and experience/skills levels. This information will not be capable of being linked to any personally identifying information about users.

If you choose to create a profile and upload a CV, we rely on you to ensure that your details are kept up to date. You should update your profile at least every six months, particularly if your contact details have changed. Once your profile is on our database we will contact you every six months using your most recent contact details to ask whether you want it to remain there. If we do not hear from you, your profile will be removed from our database.

Please note that RetailChoice.com reserves the right to remove from our database CVs which include any content that we consider to be illegal or offensive. We will also remove a CV if a complaint is upheld, which has been made against it.
