Tangence may receive data from you as part of the communication connection – the standard electronic greeting between your computer, the network and our servers. Tracking technologies may record information such as Internet domain and host names; Internet Protocol (IP) addresses; browser software and operating system types; clickstream patterns; and dates and time that our site is accessed.

At the time communication connection is established, our server will also query your computer to see if there are “cookies” previously set by [www.tangence.com](http://www.tangence.com/) to facilitate login or other site navigation procedures. A cookie is a small text file that may be used to recall Personal Information previously indicated by the web user. Most browsers allow you to control cookies, including whether or not to accept them and how to remove them. You may set most browsers to notify you if you receive a cookie, or you may choose to block cookies with your browser.

Tangence provides an “Opt-Out” on the site for cookies or by using your browser you may choose not to accept them. However, please note that if you choose to “Opt-Out”, erase, or block your cookies, you will need to re-enter your original user ID and password to gain access to certain parts of the website.

Tangence may use web beacons in HTML-formatted email messages (messages that include graphics). Web beacons are electronic images called a “single-pixel GIF” that are used in emails that Tangence sends in order to determine which email messages were opened and to note whether a message was acted upon.

Our use of cookies and other tracking technologies allows us to improve our website and your Web experience. We may also analyze information that does not contain Personal Information for trends and statistics.

You may choose whether or not to provide personal information to Tangence. If you choose not to provide the personal information we request, you can still visit most of Tangence's website, but you may be unable to access certain options and services that involve our interaction with you.

**The Data We Collect and How We Use It**

  * To engage in communications. Name, address, email, phone information may be collected and stored as part of communication history. The majority of the information collected under this category is business contact information.

**Accessing, Modifying and Deleting Profile Information and Preferences**

Tangence recognizes that users may not wish to be contacted about new or related products. Tangence allows you to Opt-Out of email marketing that may result from using the site. These choices may be made as part of the registration process or from links in marketing mailings. You may also always return to your Tangence Profile to change your election relating to Opt-Out or by sending an email to our automated link [unsubscribe@tangence.com](mailto:unsubscribe@tangence.com). Certain communication from Tangence such as customer service announcements, administrative messages are considered part of Tangence's Customer Licensing and you may not opt out of receiving them.

Our goal is to provide a way to contact Tangence should you need to update or correct that information. If for any reason those means are unavailable or inaccessible, you may send updates and corrections about your personal information to [privacy@tangence.com](mailto:privacy@tangence.com) and we will make reasonable efforts to incorporate the changes in your Tangence Profile that we hold as soon as possible. While the majority of questions and issues related to access can be handled quickly, a few complex requests may take more research and time. In these cases, access issues will be addressed within thirty (30) days or you will be contacted as to the nature of the problem and appropriate next steps.

Some information may remain in our archived records after your account has been deleted. When you register or submit information to Tangence, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of your information through a computer malfunction or human error. Tangence keeps your account information active in our user registration database in order to provide immediate access to your personalization preferences each time you visit [www.tangence.com](http://www.tangence.com/). 

If you ask Tangence to delete your Tangence Profile, in most cases your account will be deactivated and then deleted from our user registration database in approximately 90 days. This delay is necessary to discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity.

Please note that any information that we have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about your account remains in our active user databases.

The Tangence computers (called “servers”) that send your web pages store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called “log files.” Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes. After this information has been used, it is stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, your user ID may remain in our active server log files.

Tangence, Inc. does not rent or sell personal information about you with other people. We will provide information about Tangence and related partner products and services to you. Tangence will also:

  * Respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

  * Share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats, or as otherwise required by law.
  *  
  * Transfer personal information about you if Tangence is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Tangence will notify you before information about you are transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.
