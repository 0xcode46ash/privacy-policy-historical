# Resume.com Privacy Statement

Protecting the privacy of the information you submit to Resume.com is of great importance to us. We will use our best efforts to ensure that submitted information is kept private and used only in the ways described below. If you have further questions regarding our commitment to you, please feel free to contact us.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Your resume and all the information submitted for preparation of your resume is considered strictly private, and unless we believe we are required by law to do so, Resume.com will not disclose that information to anyone without your authorization, provided in accordance with your opt-out/opt-in elections at registration with us, or thereafter, consistent with your changes to such elections at any time in your user profile.

With your authorization, Resume.com may use your information or share your information with our marketing partners to make you aware of products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding changes in our products and services. Again, you may opt-out of receiving these types of communications from us simply by sending an email to [userprefs@resume.com](mailto:userprefs@resume.com) with your resume.com username.

With your authorization, Resume.com may use your information to make you aware of additional products and services that we believe may be of interest to you, or to contact you regarding site changes. Again, you may opt-out of receiving certain services or communications from us simply by editing your account preferences on Resume.com.

**STATISTICAL INFORMATION**  
Resume.com gathers collective information about our users and their use of our site. This data may be used anonymously and in the aggregate in order to improve our services and in connection with planning, marketing, and advertising our services. We may share this information with our partners, but only in the aggregate. We do not disclose information about your individual visits to Resume.com, or personal information that you provide, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, credit card number, etc., to any outside parties, except when we believe the law requires it or when you have authorized it. In addition, if you input information on a registration page co-branded by Resume.com and a third party (for instance, a co-branded contest registration), your information may become the property of both Resume.com and such third party. Resume.com is not responsible for the information that any such partner company receives.

**FEEDBACK**  
Resume.com may conduct surveys or provide areas within our site where you can submit feedback to us. You are never required to provide such information, but if you do provide it, any such information and feedback submitted to us through these mechanisms become the property of Resume.com. We may use this information and feedback for marketing purposes, or to contact you for further feedback about Resume.com.

**CONTACTING YOU**  
If Resume.com needs to contact you regarding questions about your resume while itâs being written (for example, if you forgot to enter some important information), we will try to reach you by e-mail first. In the event we must contact you by telephone regarding your resume, we will use our best efforts to contact you as discreetly as possible.

**SECURITY**  
When you place an order online at Resume.com, your personal details and credit card information are scrambled using SSL encryption technology before being sent over the Internet. Although we cannot guarantee encryption or the privacy of your personal details and credit card information, SSL makes it very difficult for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred.

Resume.com uses Îcookiesâ in order to improve our customersâ use of the site. Cookies enable us to remember customer user names, passwords and preferences, and track your use of our site, enabling us to deliver a faster, personalized, consistent service.

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
