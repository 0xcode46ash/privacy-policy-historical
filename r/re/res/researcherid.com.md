In general, you may browse our Web Sites without providing any personal information. If you want to interact with us via the Web Site, Science may ask you to provide us with some personal information. Science employs cookies in order for its server to recognize a return visitor as a unique user. These cookies are placed by the Science server and are readable only by Science - OUR cookies WILL NOT and cannot access, read or modify any other data on YOUR computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse or delete any cookie. If a visitor refuses or deletes cookies, Science does not gather any information on that visitor, but doing so will require you to re-enter certain information at each visit, or prevent us from customizing the site's features according to your preferences. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information.

However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, Science cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk. 

**Changes to our privacy policy**

From time to time, Science may change our privacy policies. If Science makes a change, it will not affect the choices you have made about any information you gave us before that change. Any changes will be reflected in an updated privacy statement that will be posted on our Web Sites.
