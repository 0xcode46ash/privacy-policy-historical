We at US Interactive Media (referred to as "US Interactive Media", "we", "us", or "our") recognize the importance of protecting the privacy of certain information ("information") collected about our customers and prospective customers (referred to as "customers", "you", "visitors" or "your"). This privacy policy, effective November 27th, 2013 discloses the privacy practices our collection, use, and disclosure of information.

## What Information Do We Collect and Why?

#### Personal and Non-Personally Identifiable Information

Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") is data about you that is personally identifiable; like your name, email address, credit card number or any other information that is not otherwise publicly available.

Non-Personally Identifiable Information ("NPII") data is collected by us or our Partners, and is used for the purpose of reporting, web traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-thru's, online, retargeting and/or other activities on our Web site. NPII data collected by our Partners is for advertising purposes and is completely anonymous, and only includes information such as the Prospect's IP address, date and time of visit, domain type, and their activity on our Advertisers' and Partners' websites. None of this information, individually or grouped together, can be traced back to a specific individual. We or our Partners may use cookies, web beacons, and/or other monitoring technologies for the purposes stated above.

### Cookies & Anonymous User Information

We use a feature of Internet web browsers called "cookies". Cookies are generated by web servers and stored on your hard drive when you visit practically any Web site on the Internet. Cookies enable us to "remember" who you are, to store your user preferences to track user trends and search patterns in general. We or our Partners use cookies to improve the quality of the information, reporting, web traffic, statistics, advertisement 'click-thru's, online, retargeting and/or other activities on our Web site.

We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve individual personally identifiable information about you from your computer unless you knowingly and willingly provided such information. The cookie technology we use cannot obtain information from your hard drive or pass on a computer virus.

You can adjust your web browser security settings to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you disable the use of cookies in your web browser, some features or services we offer at this Web site may not function properly.

We collect anonymous information about all of our Web site visitors each time they visit our Web site so that we can understand how people are using the Web site and so that we can improve upon the overall quality of our visitors' online experience. We record the date and time of your visit, the page you visited, your IP address, the Internet service provider you are using, referral data, the type of browser you are using and the type of operating system you are using. You do not have to register with us before we can collect this anonymous information. We do not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. We do not require you to share information that identifies you personally, such as your name or email address in order for you to use our Web site. We analyze information we collect about our visitors to examine trends, administer the site, and to track our visitors' paths through the Web site.

### Web Beacons

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

### Flash LSOs

We use local storage objects (LSOs) to store content information and preferences [or – other uses].

### Use of Internet Protocol ("IP") Addresses

An IP address is a unique number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are connected to the Internet. Technically speaking, your IP address could be used to reveal or be associated with your true identity. However, by law we do not have access to that information.

### Behavioral Targeting / Re-Targeting

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites.  Our ad network partner uses cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other Web sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests.  If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by clicking [Here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).  Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising.  You will continue to receive generic ads.
