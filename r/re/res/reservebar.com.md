# Privacy Policy - ReserveBar.com - Good Spirits. Delivered.

**ReserveBar takes your privacy seriously. As a result, we endeavor to maintain industry best practices in connection with your transactions as they relate to your privacy.**

A “cookie” is data stored on the customer's hard drive with information that relates directly to the customer's visit to our web site. Any information placed in the cookie is accessible only to ReserveBar and will not be sold or shared with anyone else under any circumstances. We use a cookie to store a unique session identifier, which allows us to maintain a customer’s shopping cart and state delivery selections from one page request to the next and to maintain session information from one visit to the next. By setting a cookie on our site, a customer would not have to log in more than once, thereby saving time while visiting our site. If a customer rejects the cookie, the customer may still browse the ReserveBar site. However, the user experience will be greatly curtailed. In addition, the customer will be unable to log in or make a purchase. Cookies also enable ReserveBar to track and target the interests of our customers to enhance customer experience and display products that relate directly to individual customer preferences. Cookies are tied to personal information, but the information collected through cookies is never shared with third parties. Some of ReserveBar’s business partners (e.g., advertisers, tracking utility services) use cookies on our site, but we have no access to, or control over, these cookies.

ReserveBar employs -- or our third party advertising partners -- employ software technology called “clear gifs” (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs) that helps us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. This technology utilizes tiny graphics with a unique identifier, which function similarly to cookies and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, this technology embeds invisibly on Web pages and are approximately the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

ReserveBar uses third-party service providers to provide product recommendations and enhance your shopping experience on our Web site. These companies may use information (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to the ReserveBar site in order to provide personalized recommendations and advertisements about our goods and services on the site as well as when you visit other websites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click here: http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp.

ReserveBar uses IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement and gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**We will not sell, share, or rent any personally identifiable information to others in any way that varies from what is disclosed in this statement.** ReserveBar will only share aggregated and anonymized demographic information (e.g., state of residence; zip codes of purchasers; state of residence; and zip codes of gift recipients) with its partners, affiliates and advertisers (but, again, none of this information will include personally identifiable information). ReserveBar uses FedEx as its shipping company to deliver orders and a credit card processing company to bill customers for goods and services. If you wish to obtain information regarding those company’s privacy policies, please contact ReserveBar, and ReserveBar will arrange for you to receive a copy of the policies. ReserveBar values your privacy and will never release any account information to anyone outside of the necessary core groups that have a “need to know” in order to assist in our business processes.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, ReserveBar reserves the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect ReserveBar’s rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process or proceedings to which ReserveBar becomes subject.

The ReserveBar site may contain links to other sites. Please be aware that ReserveBar is not responsible for the privacy practices of other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the ReserveBar site.

If a customer wishes to subscribe to our e-mail subscriptions, ReserveBar asks for contact information, such as name and e-mail address. ReserveBar may use your personal information for purposes other than sending you promotional materials. For example, we may use your information to complete transactions requested by you, or to send you administrative communications about any account you may have with us or about future changes to this Privacy Policy. You may also unsubscribe from promotional Emails by emailing us at privacy@ReserveBar.com.

The ReserveBar site requests, from time to time, information from customers via surveys, contests and similar methods. Participation in surveys and contests is voluntary, and the customer can choose whether to disclose information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. This information may be used for marketing opportunities by ReserveBar if authorized by the registrant and will also be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

When our order form asks customers to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL (Secure Socket Layers). On a secure page, such as our order form, the “lock” icon on the bottom of Web browsers switches to “locked,” as opposed to the “unlocked” mode during the time when the customer is just browsing. ReserveBar also takes reasonable precaution to protect user data offline. All sensitive information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer care representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information and are required to lock their station when they leave. All employees are kept up to date on the company’s security and privacy practices. Every quarter and whenever new policies are implemented, our employees are reminded about the importance of keeping customer data secure and safe at all times. The servers with personally identifiable information are stored in a locked and secure environment. If you have any questions about the security at our website, you can send an email to: privacy@ReserveBar.com

In the event that another company acquires the ReserveBar company (or a significant portion of the company’s assets is sold to another company), all customer data, including financial records and consumer information collected on ReserveBar site, may be transferred to the acquiring company. Each customer will be notified of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.

If ReserveBar decides to change its privacy policy, we will post the changes to this privacy statement, the home page and other places we deem appropriate so that you are provided reasonable notice. We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, in our sole discretion, so please review it frequently.
