# About Respondus: Privacy Statement | Respondus, Inc.

**Respondus.com Privacy Statement**

Respondus, Inc. has created this statement to explain our commitment to your privacy. We seek to protect your private information so that you have an enjoyable experience on our web site. We will not sell, rent, trade, or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. 

Please return to this page from time to time, as we will be updating this statement to accommodate additional products and services. We welcome and encourage questions, comments, and suggestions. Please contact us at privacy@respondus.com. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

**Definition of Personally Identifiable Information**  
"Personally identifiable information" is your name, company, address, e-mail address, phone number(s) and credit card information. 

**Where We Collect Personally Identifiable Information**  
Respondus.com collects personally identifiable information when you (1) register a product, (2) make a purchase, (3) sign up for a beta program, newsletter, or similar program, (4) submit feedback, or other inquiries. 

**How We Use Personally Identifiable Information**  
Respondus uses your personally identifiable information to bill your credit card for purchases, to confirm your orders, to prevent fraud against you, and to contact you. For example, when you place an order on Respondus.com, we need to know your name, institution, e-mail address, address, and credit card information. This allows us to fulfill your order and notify you of your order status. 

Respondus.com also compiles aggregate data from all of our visitors to prepare internal reports about which pages are popular, how many total unique users visit our site, and different traffic patterns. Respondus does not combine your personally identifiable information with information about pages visited. 

**Who We Disclose Personally Identifiable Information To**  
Respondus, Inc. will not sell, rent, trade or disclose your personally identifiable information to anyone except as explained in this policy. 

We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, marketing our products, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. These companies have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes or share it with an additional party, 

Respondus may also disclose your personal information to law enforcement personnel, government officials, or others when we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is necessary to prevent violations of the law, injury to person or property, or any harm to Respondus.com or others. 

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the event that Respondus, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will likely be one of the transferred assets. 

**Security**

**How We Protect Your Information**  
Every time you order a product from Respondus.com, it will be transmitted on a secure server (SSL) that encrypts all of your personal information before it is sent to us. 

No data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. Although Respondus.com is committed to protecting your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you send to Respondus, and you do so at your own risk. 

**Credit Card Protection Guarantees**  
Visa now offers 100% protection for online purchases (visa.com) for Visa cards issued in the United States. American Express also offers 100% protection for online purchases (Americanexpress.com). Most banks will either reimburse you for all unauthorized charges, or limit your liability to $50.00. 

**Cookies and Privacy**

**What A Cookie Is**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. Cookies store information about your use of a particular web site or service and are typically used to make services more convenient and personalized. Most cookies are "session cookies," which are automatically deleted whenever you leave a web site (and end the "session"). Some cookies remain on your computer until you remove them. 

**How We Use Cookies**  
We use cookies (1) to estimate the number of visitors to our web site, (2) to measure general traffic patterns, and (3) to store the items you've placed in your shopping cart. Most browsers permit you to set the browser to accept, reject, or notify you of cookie use. However, some parts of the Respondus.com site may not function properly if your browser is set to reject cookies. 

Our shopping cart will remember your cart contents for up to 14 days, for the convenience of our returning customers. It does not retain personal information of any kind, only products added to your shopping cart. 

**Children and Privacy**

**Our Policy For Guests Under Age 18**  
Respondus.com is committed to protecting the privacy of children. We encourage parents and guardians to explore the Internet with their children or students. Visitors under age 18 should not submit any personally identifiable information to Respondus.com. Respondus does not sell products for purchase by children. 

**How You Can Change Your Information**

**Updating, Correcting, Or Deleting Your Information**  
Because your account information is stored offline for added security, there is no provision for you to manually edit your account information via the web browser. 

If you receive an e-mail from us, you can have your e-mail address edited or deleted from a particular list by replying to the e-mail message with the word REMOVE as the subject. Please understand that we maintain different mailing lists, such as one for registered users of Respondus Lite and another for people who have signed up to participate in a beta program. If you have provided us information at different times or for different purposes, it may be necessary to have your e-mail address removed from multiple lists.
