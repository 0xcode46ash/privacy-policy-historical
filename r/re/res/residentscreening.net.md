# PRIVACY & SECURITY POLICY

**PRIVACY & SECURITY POLICY**

Privacy and security issues are of paramount importance to First American Registry, Inc. ("FAR"). This Privacy & Security Policy describes how FAR uses and protects information it collects or maintains. FAR requests that you read this Privacy & Security Policy frequently, as changes may occur from time to time. 

**FAR's Commitment to Data Security**

FAR’s order environment features several of the most widely accepted and endorsed security methods to ensure that transactions, ordering and fulfillment are safe and that all exchanges of information remain confidential, except as described below. 

The primary measures of security employed within the FAR environment are the use of SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption and third-party firewall filtering technologies. In addition, every session by a FAR member requires a unique membership number and password before access to the system is permitted. Finally, ICSA (International Computer Security Association) certification requires that we constantly monitor the FARsystem in accordance with our security policy and management practices.

Netscape's Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is the standard technology for secure, Web-based communications. All traffic between FAR customers and the Web server is encrypted with a unique "session key." SSL is built into server hardware, and requires a "digital ID" in order to be functional. These layers of protection virtually guarantee that unauthorized parties cannot view information. With SSL and this digital ID in place, the FAR site protects communications between the Web server and a FAR user. Firewall filtering is a set of related programs that protect the resources of a private network from users from other networks. The firewall acts as a defense barrier between the FAR server and the Internet, granting access and information only to those who are authorized to do so. In addition to these measures, each transaction is password-protected as an integral part of FAR membership. A private password works in conjunction with a unique membership number the same way that an ATM password protects your card from unauthorized use. Online transactions within the FAR environment can only be performed by users with legitimate membership numbers and passwords. ICSA certification of the FAR site ensures that an independent agency has investigated the standards and practices represented in the site and deemed the site worthy of its seal of approval. ICSA Web certification reduces Web site risks and liability for both the operator and visitor by providing, verifying, and improving the use of baseline security standards. The certification is comprised of on-site evaluation, remote testing and spot checking, using an evolving set of industry-endorsed standards and practices. This certification uniquely demonstrates FAR's efforts to protect customer information and data integrity. While we make every effort to ensure the integrity and security of our network and systems, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third-party "hackers" from illegally obtaining information.

**User Information FAR Collects and How it is Used**

FAR collects information in different ways from Visitors and Members who access the various parts of our services and the network of web sites accessible through our service ("Services").

_Registration_

Members are asked to provide certain user information when they sign-up for our Services, including name, address, and telephone number. The user information collected from Members during the registration process is used to manage each Member's account. FAR on occasion does share this information with vendors or other third parties, in order to enhance, develop or provide existing or new services. 

_Responses to Email Inquiries_

When Visitors or Members send email inquiries to FAR, the return email address is used to answer the email inquiry we receive and to provide Service Notifications or other marketing materials. 

_Voluntary User Surveys_

We may periodically conduct user surveys. We encourage users to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information that helps us improve the types of services we offer and how they are provided to you. Participation in our customer surveys is always voluntary. Aggregated information may be shared with third parties in particular circumstances.

_Other Circumstances_

Generally, it is FAR's policy not to use or share user information about Visitors of Members in ways unrelated to the ones described above.
