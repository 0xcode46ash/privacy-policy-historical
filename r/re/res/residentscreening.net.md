We are committed to and maintain the following Privacy Values and Practices

We are committed to and maintain the following Privacy Values and Practices regarding the information we collect, maintain, disclose, and disseminate about consumers.

CoreLogic SafeRent Privacy Values

**Fairness**

CoreLogic SafeRent constantly considers consumers' expectations about their privacy in our business practices. Using the [Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)](https://web.archive.org/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra) as our guide, we constantly strive to maintain a balance between serving our clients, maintaining privacy, and ensuring accuracy of information.

**Public Record**

CoreLogic SafeRent believes that an open public record is of significant value to society, enhances consumer choice, and ultimately creates consumer opportunity. We support an open public record and recognize its importance to the economy, to society, and to the safety of the general public.

**Use**

We believe that we should behave responsibly when we use information about a consumer. CoreLogic SafeRent's process of collecting, disseminating and disclosing information is designed to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local statutory requirements, governing the use of consumer data, including those found in the [FCRA](https://web.archive.org/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra). Furthermore, any consumer information that is distributed to our clients is done with a commitment, under the terms and conditions of the CoreLogic SafeRent Screening Service Agreement, that each client will handle all consumer information provided to them in an appropriate, secure, and confidential manner.

**Accuracy**

CoreLogic SafeRent takes reasonable steps to help ensure the accuracy of the data we collect, use and disseminate. Where possible, we take reasonable steps to investigate claims of inaccurate or incomplete data we collect, use, and disseminate, and if appropriate, correct inaccurate information that we maintain using the [FCRA](https://web.archive.org/consumer_relations/glossary/index.php#fcra) as our guide. In cases where we receive inquiries about information we do not maintain and manage, we take reasonable steps to refer the consumer to the source of the data which they believe to be erroneous.

**Education**

CoreLogic SafeRent endeavors to educate employees, clients, and others in the multifamily housing industry about the importance of consumer privacy. It is our goal to ensure consumers are informed as to how CoreLogic SafeRent, and our clients, use the consumer information we maintain, manage and disseminate. We also encourage all parties, with whom we conduct business, to collect and use information in a responsible manner. We are open with consumers about the various types of information we maintain and will also discuss with a consumer the source of that information.

**Confidentiality and Security**

We strive to ensure utilization of appropriate facilities and systems to protect against unauthorized access to or corruption of the data we collect, maintain and disseminate. We use various identity verification methods to determine the accurate identity of a consumer making a request. We employ security procedures for handling consumer information as well as maintaining physical security and limiting access to our facilities in order to safeguard information we collect, maintain, and disseminate.

**Special Message for Connecticut Residents Regarding the Confidentiality of Social Security Numbers.**

Connecticut's legislature passed Public Act 08-167 requiring that consumer reporting agencies, like CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc., display to Connecticut residents how CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. protects the confidentiality of social security numbers; prohibits the unlawful disclosure of social security numbers; and, limits access to social security numbers. CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. takes the same protective measures described above with regard to other nonpublic personal information when handling a social security number and, generally, also does the following in addition: CoreLogic SafeRent, Inc. does not release the full social security number in reports produced from its own databases, even when a consumer has requested a copy of his/her own report. A description of our basic security for nonpublic personal information is described above and applies to the social security number.
