# Privacy_Policy

Please review our Privacy Policy to learn more about the ways in which we use and protect your personal information. We recognize and respect the privacy expectations of today's consumers and the requirements of applicable state and federal privacy laws. We believe that making you aware of how we use your Personally Identifiable Information, and to whom it is disclosed, will form the basis for a relationship of trust between us.

To make our Privacy Policy easy to understand, we have built it around four simple privacy principles: 

**• Disclose** – You have the right to know what data is collected by RES.NET and how, in general, that data will be used. 

**• Choice** – You have the right to choose to share information with us, when it is reasonable to do so. 

**• Access, Edit and Non-Use** – You have the right to access, edit and review Personally Identifiable Information (information that may be directly traceable to you, such as your name, phone number or address). 

**• Security** – You have a right to know what security measures we have implemented to protect your Personally Identifiable Information.

**Collection of information**

Our primary purpose in collecting personal information is to provide you with a safe, efficient, and customized experience. We only collect personal information about you that we consider necessary to achieve this purpose. In general, you can browse RES.NET without revealing your identity or any other personal information. When you provide us with your personal information, you are no longer anonymous to us. If you decide to use our services, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout RES.NET. Wherever possible, we indicate which fields are optional fields. You always have the option to withhold personal information by choosing not to use a particular service or feature.

**Use of Your Information**

We use information gathered on RES.NET, whether personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of delivering products, offering services as well as improving the RES.NET website to foster a positive user experience. We may also use information we gather to contact you via telephone or email to inform you of other products or services available from RES.NET, contact you concerning your opinion of current products and services or to advise you of new products and services that may be offered in the future. The nature and frequency of these messages will vary based on the information you select. During registration, you have the option to receive additional communications, information and promotions including free informational newsletters from RES.NET relating to topics that may be of special interest to you. In addition, RES.NET offers a section where you can submit feedback. If you submit feedback, your input becomes the property of RES.NET. This information may be used for marketing purposes (success stories) or to contact you for additional information.

**Third Party Disclosure**

Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information collected from you by RES.NET. In the event you disclose your private information to other parties, such as bidders, buyers or sellers on our site or other sites throughout the Internet, we encourage you to obtain a copy of their privacy policies. We are not responsible for the content or the privacy practices employed by other parties. Therefore, we encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others.

**Control of Your Password**

You are responsible for all actions taken with your User ID and password. For that reason, we recommend that you do not disclose your RES.NET password to anyone. However, should you decide to share your User ID and password or any other pertinent personal information with third parties, you are responsible for all actions others may perform on your account. If you forfeit control of your password, you may forfeit substantial control over your personal information and could be subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately change it.

**Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Personal Information**

RES.NET provides options for you to review, edit, update or change your RES.NET account profile information, including your password, at any time. Simply login to your RES.NET account and go to Update My Profile to review your account information. If you opted to receive newsletters, commercial e-mails or other communications from RES.NET or third parties at the time you registered with RES.NET, but subsequently change your mind, you may change your options by editing your Account Profile as described above. If you previously opted not to receive other communications, you may opt-in later by editing your Account Profile.

**Security**

RES.NET is hosted on a secure Web server whose identity is certified by VeriSign, an industry leader in Web site trust services. When you login to RES.NET, your username and password are sent over the Internet from your computer to our Website via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your Personally Identifiable Information before it times off your computer, ensuring that no one else can read your personal information.

We use our best efforts to train and oversee our employees and agents to ensure that your information will be handled responsibly and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We currently maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with state and federal regulations to guard your Personally Identifiable Information. Whereas "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet, we strive to ensure no unauthorized parties have access to any of your information. 

**Notice to Amend Privacy Policy Statement**

We reserve the right to amend this Privacy Policy Statement at any time by posting amended terms which automatically become effective 30 days after the posting date on the RES.NET Website.
