**Email Preferences/Opt-out**  
We send out two types of emails ¾ transactional and promotional. Our users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of receiving promotional communications from Restaurant.com by updating their email preferences in your “[My Account](http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp)” or by sending an email with the information to update to [info@restaurant.com](mailto:info@restaurant.com). 

> **Transactional emails**  
>  Transactional emails include registration, confirmation, account update, customer service, restaurant surveys and other communications that Restaurant.com needs to reach our customers concerning their account, requests or purchases. This does not include any promotional communications, such as sales or specials. You may not opt out of these transactional communications. These emails will all be sent from a Restaurant.com address, for example lastname@restaurant.com or halfprice@restaurant.com. 
> 
> **Promotional emails**  
>  Promotional emails are sent to customers who opted into our email list. This option is provided when registering with Restaurant.com. These emails share exclusive sales and offers with our users and will be sent from restaurant_com@emailrestaurant.com. 
> 
> If you are having trouble receiving these emails first check your spam/junk folder. Occasionally emails can mistakenly end up in your spam/junk folder; it may help to add restaurant_com@emailrestaurant.comto your address book. You can also email [info@restaurant.com](mailto:info@restaurant.com) and have us check to make sure you are still on the list, be sure to include your email address.
> 
> If you have opted-in to receive promotional emails you may opt out of these promotional emails at any time by updating your email preferences in “[My Account](http://www.restaurant.com/my-restaurant.asp)” or by sending an email with their request to [info@restaurant.com](mailto:info@restaurant.com).

**Information or Data Sharing**  
As a general rule, except as described in this privacy policy, we will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except when we have your permission or under special circumstances (such as when we believe the law requires it). We may disclose or share aggregated demographic information with certain partners, affiliates and advertisers, however, except as described above, this is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person or company. In addition, Restaurant.com may disclose account or other personal information when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with Restaurant.com's rights or property, other Website users or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. 

Restaurant.com may also release personal information to appropriate governmental authorities under the following circumstances: 

    * Where release is required by law (for example, a subpoena) or regulation, or is requested by a government agency conducting investigations or proceedings; or 
    * Where our records indicate a company may be engaged in fraudulent activity or other deceptive practices that a governmental agency should be made aware of. 



As with any other business, it is possible that Restaurant.com in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Restaurant.com, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Privacy Policy unless and until it is amended as described herein.

**Surveys**  
From time-to-time Restaurant.com may request information from users via surveys (e.g. within the Feedback section of the Website). Participation in these surveys, to the extent we run any, is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code and age level). Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring ad/or improving the use and satisfaction of the Website.

**Restaurant Surveys and Access to Information**  
For purposes of allowing targeted marketing restaurant owners are provided with access to the name and email information for each purchaser of a Restaurant.com dining certificate for their restaurant once such certificate has been validated. After you have used your dining certificate you may be invited to take a survey to provide feedback to the restaurant about your dining experience. These survey results will be provided to the restaurant. If you choose to leave added comments the restaurant will be provided with your name and email address along with your comment so they may follow-up if necessary. If you would like to send comments to Restaurant.com you may send an email to [info@restaurant.com](mailto:info@restaurant.com) at anytime.

**Links**  
This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites, as this privacy policy applies solely to Restaurant.com. We encourage our users to remain vigilant when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

**Security**  
The Restaurant.com team takes security seriously and takes numerous precautions to protect our customer’s personal information. When our users submit sensitive information via the Website (e.g. [credit card information]), such information is protected both on- and offline. **[We encrypt certain sensitive information using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology to ensure that our visitors' information is safe as it is sent over the internet to our server. SSL works by using a private key to encrypt data that is transferred over the SSL connection]**. 

In addition, all of our users' sensitive information is restricted in our offices. While Restaurant.com employs commercially reasonable security measures to protect our data and seeks to partner with companies, which do the same, we cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any data transmission over the internet or any wireless network. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, and we therefore are not responsible for any breach of security or for any actions of any third parties that may receive any such information.

The new terms shall be effective immediately upon being posted on the Website. It is the responsibility of each user to review the latest terms from time to time, and if any user does not agree with any updates to the privacy policy, such user should immediately cease use of the Website and any purchased services.
