#### Our Commitment To Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested. 

#### The Information We Collect:

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the ResumeBucket website. On our pages, you are asked to enter detailed information about yourself. This information includes, but is not limited to: 

  * Name 
  * Address 
  * Email address 
  * Phone number 
  * Detailed Job History 



On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, we have an "Invite a Friend" feature that we highly encourage you to use. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected can include: 

  * Name 
  * Email Address 



#### The Way We Use Information:

We use the information you provide about yourself when signing up is for your personal use only. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to provide accurate advertising(how we make our money) on the pages on our site you view. For example, we might share your zip code or state with an affiliate advertising company in order to display available jobs in your location. Names and contact information would not be required for this type of transaction. 

We use the information you provide about someone else when using the Invite a Friend feature only in sending a inquisitive message to their email address. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that goal. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

You can register with our website if you would like to receive our product updates and company information as well as potential new services we may offer. Information you submit on our website will not be used for this purpose unless you fill out the registration form. 

We use non-identifying and aggregate information to better design our website and to share with advertisers. For example, we may tell an advertiser that X number of individuals visited a certain area on our website, or that Y number of men and Z number of women filled out our registration form, but we would not disclose anything that could be used to identify those individuals. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

#### Our Commitment To Data Security
