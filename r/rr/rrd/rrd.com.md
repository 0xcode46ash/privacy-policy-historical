Safe Harbor

RR Donnelley recognizes that the European Union ("EU") has an "omnibus" data protection regime established pursuant to the European Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC) (the "Directive").

In order to address this requirement, RR Donnelley adheres to the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Privacy Principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Safe Harbor") with respect to certain individually identifiable information about individuals in the European Union who are customers or employees of RR Donnelley's customers ("EU Customer Data") and about individuals in the European Union who are RR Donnelley or its affiliates' employees ("EU Employee Data") (collectively, EU Customer Data and EU Employee Data is referred to as "EU Personal Information"). RR Donnelley's practices concerning EU Employee Data is published to affected EU employees through other company policies and procedures. For more information about the Safe Harbor, please refer to the U.S. Department of Commerce website at <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor>.
