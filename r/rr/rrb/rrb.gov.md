You have the option of using e-mail to contact us. This is not secure e-mail! We ask that you not send information by e-mail that you would not want a third party to read. If you need to provide us with personal information, such as your Social Security number or home address, please call, write or visit your field office. 

In reply, we will send you only general information by e-mail. If we can identify you and have your telephone number or address in our records, we will furnish any personal information by telephone or letter.

The privacy of our customers has always been important to the Railroad Retirement Board. Our concern for your privacy is no different in the electronic age.

Our internet privacy policy embodies the following principles:

  * We collect personally identifiable information (such as name, e-mail address, Social Security number, or other unique identifier) only if specifically and knowingly provided by you. You should note, however, that when you send us an e-mail, you automatically furnish us with your e-mail address, even if you don't furnish any additional personal information.   

  * Personally identifying information that you voluntarily provide us will be used only for the purpose you intend it. For example, if you e-mail us a suggestion on how we can improve our website, we will use the information you provide only for that purpose. If you complete a form to ask us a specific question about your benefits and provide us with the needed identifying information and where we can reach you, we will use the information to obtain an answer and respond to you (by mail or phone.)
