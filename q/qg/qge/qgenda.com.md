1.         Modification of Privacy Policy.  We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time, and without prior notice, by posting an amended Privacy Policy that is always accessible by clicking on the "Privacy Policy" link on this site's home page. Your continued use of this site indicates your acceptance of the amended Privacy Policy.  You should check the Privacy Policy through this link periodically for modifications by clicking on the link provided near the top of the Privacy Policy for a listing of material modifications and their effective dates.  Regarding PII, if any modifications are materially less restrictive on our use or disclosure of the PII previously disclosed by you, we will obtain your consent before implementing such revisions with respect to such information.

2.         Privacy Statement.  Precision Software, Inc.  ("Precision") operates this web site.  All references to "we", "us", "this web site" or "this site" shall be construed to mean Precision.   Precision understands that visitors to this web site are concerned about the privacy of information. The following describes our privacy policy, including our policy regarding information that we collect through this web site.

3.         Collection of Anonymous, Passive Information.  As you navigate through this site, certain anonymous information may be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons, and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). For example, as explained in more detail below, your Internet browser automatically transmits to this site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the Web site you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this site might not work without cookies.

The following is a listing and a brief explanation of passive information collection methodologies which we may use from time to time to enhance the services we offer.

            A "cookie" is a bit of information that this site sends to your Web browser which helps us remember information about you and your preferences. 

            "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the site "remembers" previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes), and collect aggregate statistical information on the site. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer. 

            "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided, helping to determine what areas of the site you may find most valuable, and customizing the site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this site in your computer do not hold Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

            You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser. 

            An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a site, and administer and improve the site. 

            "Internet tags" (also known as Web Beacons, single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the Web site server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. 

            "Navigational data" (log files, server logs, and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors.

4.         Use and Sharing of Anonymous, Passive Information.  This site may make full use of passively collected anonymous information through the collection methods described above, including without limitation the right to use such information to provide better service to site visitors, customize the site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends, and otherwise administer and improve the site for your use.  We reserve the right to share this information in the same manner as provided below for PII (defined below).

5.         Collection of Personally Identifiable Information ("PII").  We will ask you when we need information that personally identifies you or allows us to contact you (which we refer to as "PII").  PII which we collect may vary depending on the benefits and/or services you select, and may include one or more of the following categories of information: name, email address, and phone number.

6.         Use And Sharing of PII: General Policy.  Except as discussed below, our general policy is that we will use your PII only for the performance of the services or transaction for which it was given, and we will not share, sell, or rent your PII to others.  The only exceptions to this general policy are (i) if this privacy policy explicitly provides otherwise, and (ii) if explicitly approved by you through our site.    WE WILL NEVER UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES COMBINE PASSIVELY COLLECTED INFORMATION WITH YOUR PII.

7.         Sharing of PII: Affiliates.  Unless prohibited by law, we may use and share PII within any companies that may legally affiliated with us (such as, for example, any parent, subsidiary, or brother or sister entity) for purposes of providing service and account maintenance, to help us design and improve products and services, and to offer products and services that may be of interest to you.  

8.         Sharing of PII: Third-Party Service Providers. We may hire other companies to provide services on our behalf.  These third-party service providers may include, for example, companies that (i) host, manage, and service our website, web servers, software and systems, (ii) provide business or data processing services, (iii) provide marketing services, (iv) provide payment processing, fulfillment, and/or shipping services, (i) refer you to this site in their capacity as our marketing partner or affiliate, and (vi) provide other new services.  We may share or make PII accessible to such third parties; however, all such third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of PII and are prohibited from using PII for any purpose other than for the services they provide, which may include emails, but only to the extent email is integral to their services.

9.         Sharing of PII: In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy.  In the event that we are acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your PII is treated, transferred, or used.

10.        Sharing of PII: Legal Process.  We reserve the right to share PII with third parties in response to a subpoena, to prevent fraud, to comply with an inquiry by a government agency or other regulator, or as necessary for other legal purposes.    

11.        Onward Transfer of PII Outside Your Country of Residence.  By providing PII to our site, you acknowledge that our site operates in the United States, and further you agree to (i) permit our site to transmit and use your PII anywhere necessary, including across international boundaries, to affect the services and transactions provided by this site; and (ii) that such use will be subject to the terms and conditions stated in this Privacy Policy.

12.        Security of PII.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect your PII and other sensitive information.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet or method of data storage can be guaranteed 100% secure.  Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information by following generally accepted industry standards, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us or store at this site.

Use of their cookies is not covered by our privacy policy, and we are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites.

17.        Children’s Online Policy.  We are committed to preserving online privacy for all of its website visitors, including children.
