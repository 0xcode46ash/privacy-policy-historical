**QRZ.COM Privacy Policy**  


QRZ, is deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of consumer information. We welcome all users to our site and want to insure that you are comfortable. We pledge that as we gather and use information about you, we do so responsibly. 

> This site, QRZ.COM, uses the services of Engage for the serving and/or targeting of ads, promotions and other marketing messages. To do this, Engage collects anonymous data through the use of cookies. To learn more about Engage, including your ability to opt out of the Engage system, go to http://www.engage.com/privacy 

**Consumer Information**

QRZ.COM publishes information on the World Wide Web and on CDROM that is obtained from open, public domain sources and in some cases directly and voluntarily from users themselves. The information may include but is not limited to, your name, your address, your email address and possibly other data that you may voluntarily provide. 

This information is generally used by members of the amateur radio community for the purposes of contacting each other through both internet and traditional means. Our site is also used as a means by which to share common interest information as it applies to the worldwide community of amateur radio operators. 

Amateur radio address and contact information is and has been published in the public domain for a great many years. Before the advent of the Internet and the World Wide Web, the same types of information that we now provide was routinely published in printed directories (Callbooks). These directories are of a paramount interest to those involved in this particular hobby, especially as it applies to the exchange of written communications that result from contacts made on the air. 

**Data Collection and Opt Out**

Participation in the QRZ data collection process is voluntary except for the occasional use of browser "cookies". 

QRZ, as well as most sites on the Internet, occasionaly may use "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. QRZ cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time you visit a particular area on our site, or are first served with a particular advertisement. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps QRZ's advertisers target ads to you. This cookie can help them ensure that they don't serve you the same ad multiple times, and it help's our advertisers understand what you like and don't like about their offerings so that they can cater better to your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same ad and delivering more relevant content to you. Cookies are not required for QRZ to deliver you its content. 

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information. 

**Opt Out Procedure**

If you would like to "opt out," that is, to prevent any data from being stored or displayed by QRZ about you, please notify us by email. Please address all correspondence to: [editor@qrz.com](mailto:editor@qrz.com) and simply state your amateur radio CALLSIGN and which information you would like **not** to have presented by QRZ. 

**Participation in Industry-side Privacy Initiatives**

QRZ recognizes several trade associations and privacy groups that are both actively shaping privacy policies and support consumer privacy. 

If you have any additional questions about QRZ's dedication to consumer privacy, please contact us at [editor@qrz.com](mailto:editor@qrz.com).
