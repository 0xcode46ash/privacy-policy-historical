# Qtrax - Privacy

Privacy policy

Qtrax.com (Qtrax) strives to offer its visitors the many advantages of Internet technology and to provide an interactive and personalized experience. We may use Personally Identifiable Information (your name, e-mail address, street address, telephone number) subject to the terms of this privacy policy. We will never sell, barter, or rent your email address to any unauthorized third party, period!

You can visit the public portion of our site without the required need to register or revealing any personal information about you or your company. If you choose to request our clients’ music for your user experience, you may be required to supply certain information about yourself or your company as that information is necessary for us to complete transactions and communications between us.

How we gather information from users

How we collect and store information depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. For example, you may be asked to provide information when you register for access to certain portions of our site or request certain features, such as music and our music player, newsletters, or when you make a purchase. Among other things, the cookie may store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information, for example by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we may not be able to customize the site’s features according to your preferences.

What we do with the information we collect

Like other Web publishers, we collect information to enhance your visit and deliver more individualized content and advertising. We respect your privacy and do not share your information with anyone.

We may use Personally Identifiable Information collected on Qtrax.com to communicate with you about your registration and customization preferences, our Terms of Service and privacy policy, services and products offered by Qtrax and other topics we think you might find of interest.

Personally Identifiable Information collected by Qtrax may also be used for other purposes, including but not limited to site administration, troubleshooting, processing of e-commerce transactions, administration of sweepstakes and contests, and other communications with you. We will use your information only as permitted by law. In addition, from time to time as we continue to develop our business, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In such transactions, user information may be among the transferred assets. We may also disclose your information in response to a court order, at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law, in connection with the collection of amounts you may owe to us, and/or to law enforcement authorities whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary. Please note we may not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.

Affiliated sites, linked sites and advertisements

Qtrax expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. Through Qtrax you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, Web sites, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties. Qtrax is not responsible for the actions or policies of such third parties. You should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing information on a feature or page operated by a third party.

You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose Personally Identifiable Information on message boards or in chat areas, that information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of Qtrax and this policy.

If we discover we have received any information from a child under 13 in violation of this policy, we will delete that information immediately.
