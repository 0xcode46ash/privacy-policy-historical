QTAC's _Apply by Web (ABW_ ) and _Twelve to Tertiary (TTT)_ application services and QTAC's Change of Preference service both require Java to be enabled.

This website also utilises non-persistent (per-session) cookies to hold information about your session. A 'cookie' is sent to your computer when you complete certain tasks on this website. A cookie contains bits of information that enables our servers (i.e. the computers that house this website) to identify and interact efficiently with your computer. Cookies are designed to provide a better, more customised website experience, and to make it easier for you to use this website. 

You can configure your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is being sent to your computer. The 'help function' on your browser will provide you with details on how to change your browser configurations.

QTAC take reasonable precautions to ensure that any information you provide to us through our websites is transferred securely from our servers to our mainframe computers (no personally identifiable information is stored on our servers). These mainframe computers are not able to be accessed directly through the internet, due to protection provided by several levels of firewall security to prevent unauthorised access.

However, no data protection and security measures are completely secure. Despite all the measures we have put in place, we cannot guarantee the security of your information, particularly in relation to transmissions over the internet. Accordingly, any information which you transmit to us is transmitted at your own risk. You must take care to ensure you protect your information (for example, by protecting your QTAC usernames and passwords) and you should notify us as soon as possible after you become aware of any security breaches.

SPAM means unsolicited advertising material sent via email. We will not send out this type of material.

#### Online payments

QTAC is committed to ensuring our customers' payment card data is safe and secure at all times. We use a recognised payment service provider that is required to take reasonable steps to protect your information. ****

#### What is our privacy relationship with third party websites?

This website includes hyperlinks to enable you to access a number of other websites by clicking on these hyperlinks we have provided. These third party websites are not subject to this Online Security Statement. We recommend that you read their privacy and security statements to understand how they deal with your personal information online.

This Online Security Statement operates from 10 March 2014.

Due to evolving technologies and types of functionality available on this website, we encourage you to review this Online Security Statement from time to time as it may be updated.
