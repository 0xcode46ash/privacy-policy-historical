What personal information do we collect about our customers?

Customer information is gathered so we can better serve you, and we make reasonable efforts to insure the security of your personal information and to treat that information responsibly. We collect the personal information that our customers give us when they choose to purchase a product from QVC or use our site. For example, when you register with QVC we will ask you to provide your name, e-mail address, physical address and telephone number. If you purchase a product, we will also ask you for financial information such as your QCard or other credit card number and a shipping address. Registration with QVC is required to make a purchase or post a message on our [Community Forum](http://community.qvc.com/?cont=policycf). Similarly, we will ask you for contact information if you use our E-mail to a Friend program, or if you request that QVC send you E-newsletters or other promotional notices or seek information or assistance from us.

If you are a member of a QVC recognized third party affinity program, we may also collect personal information about your membership and your purchases on our site.

Your use of certain optional portions of this site such as contest or sweepstakes entries and [employment applications](http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.html/params.file.%7Chr%7Cindex,html/left.html.file.%7Cnav%7Cnavhqemplo,html) may involve our collection of additional personal information about you, including your social security number.

What other kinds of customer information do we collect?

If you ask us to ship a purchase to somebody else or you use our E-mail to a Friend program, we will ask you for the name and address or e-mail address of the person to whom you are sending or recommending the product, as well as your name and contact information.

Our system also keeps track of which browser and Internet Provider (IP) you use to access our site. In addition, to help us understand the use of our site by our visitors and improve your shopping experience, we automatically collect information as to how you were directed to the site, how you navigate around it and what products you browse, as well as your purchasing activities.

How do we collect this information?

When you register with QVC, we compile the personal information you give us about yourself into an individual profile. We add other personal information about you to that profile as you give it to us. We also collect information about your purchases and other uses of our site as they are made.

We gather other information through the use of cookies and web beacons.

How do we use cookies?

Cookies are pieces of text that allow a website to store on your own computer an identification code associated with you which can later be retrieved and associated with your visit to the site. Session cookies terminate shortly after you close your Internet browser. Persistent cookies are stored on your hard drive until they expire or are deleted. Both types of cookies enhance our ability to serve you by recalling information about you such as your password, shopping preferences and shopping cart. This saves you time on your next visit to our site and personalizes your shopping experience.

We understand that not everyone wants to permit the use of cookies. The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting cookies and how to disable cookies, but we recommend that you leave cookies turned on so that you can take full advantage of the shopping features available on our site.

How do we use web beacons?

Web beacons are small, transparent graphics that are placed on web pages to track how visitors arrive at a site and what they do there. We use web beacons to track customers’ browsing activities at our website and to compile sales and statistical data. For example, beacons let us know when a purchase is made on our site by a member of a third party affinity program and when a purchase is initiated by an advertisement we placed on a third party’s website. This information assists us in managing our site and enhancing your shopping experience.

Do visitors need to provide personal information to use our site?

Personal information is not required to access or navigate around the site. However, you will be asked to register and provide personal information if you want to make a purchase or post a message. Personal information is also required to request information or assistance from us or to take advantage of certain optional features of our site such as our E-mail to a Friend program, contests or sweepstakes and employment opportunities.

What if a visitor doesn’t want to give us personal information over the Internet?

You are free to look for products on either our show or our site and place a telephone order by calling 1-888-345-5788 toll-free. We respect the confidentiality of all your personal information as described in this Privacy Statement whether you give it to us via the telephone or the Internet.

How do we protect customers’ personal information?

All of your personal information is encrypted by Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software when it is transmitted to us via the web. We maintain the servers that store this information in a locked facility with restricted access. We also truncate your credit card number to the last four digits when we communicate with you about your order.

How do we use information about our customers?

We use your personal information to process your orders. This includes for example, contacting you to confirm your order, fulfilling the order and shipping it. We may also contact you if we want to communicate with you about your order.

Additionally, we will use your contact information to send you E-newsletters or other promotional notices, or to respond to requests for information or assistance from you.

If you are a member of one of our third party affinity programs, we will use and disclose your personal information to administer and manage that program. Similarly, if you choose to participate in certain optional features of our website such as our E-mail to a Friend program, contests or sweepstakes and [employment applications](http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.html/params.file.%7Chr%7Cindex,html/left.html.file.%7Cnav%7Cnavhqemplo,html), we will use your personal information to administer and manage those features.

We may also use your personal information to improve our service to you and for other business purposes. For example, we periodically review customer information as part of servicing our accounts. We may also contact you from time to time to inform you of the services that we offer and to gather information about how we can improve them.

Finally, we analyze information we obtain from cookies and web beacons concerning our customers’ access and navigation of our site and their browsing and purchasing activities to improve our services and enhance our customers’ shopping experiences.

How do we share customers’ personal information with third parties?

In order to process your orders and requests, we make your name, address, and sometimes your e-mail address or telephone number available to other entities such as credit card companies and package delivery services (for example, American Express, Visa, UPS, and USPS). Similarly, if you order a product that is shipped directly from another company, or offered by QVC in conjunction with another company, we will share personal information about that order with the other company.

We may use third party agents, consultants and contractors to perform business functions on our behalf, including customer service, account servicing, customer research, marketing, provision of IT services and records maintenance. We give these entities access to our customers’ personal information to perform these functions for us and do not authorize them to use that information for any other purpose.

Additionally, we share personal information about you when you voluntarily use certain optional features of our site. If you are a member of a third party affinity program, we will share information concerning your purchases on our site with that organization. If you ask us to send a particular product to a friend or use our E-mail to a Friend program, we will tell that person we are sending the product or e-mail at your request. If you participate in a contest or sweepstakes or submit an [employment application](http://www.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.html/params.file.%7Chr%7Cindex,html/left.html.file.%7Cnav%7Cnavhqemplo,html), we may share the information you submit with others assisting us in the administration of that feature. If you post a message for inclusion on our Community Forum or Live Chat, the contents of that posting will be available to all other participants and will be accompanied by your user name.

It is possible that QVC or part of its business or one of its affiliates could merge with, acquire or be acquired by another business entity and your personal information could be among the assets transferred. If this occurs, you will be notified of the change by e-mail or notice on this site.

We reserve the right to share personal information about you with our affiliates in the course of our business operations. We also reserve the right to share personal information about you as required by law or in cooperation with legal authorities and to enforce the General Terms and Conditions governing use of this site or to protect the rights, property, or safety of QVC and its customers.

How do we share other customer information with third parties?

We may share non-personal non-individually identifiable (aggregate) information about our customers with the group of people with whom we share personal information, as well as with other third parties such as vendors, advertisers and marketing firms.

How can visitors to our site check or change the information we collect about them?

You can always review your personal profile at QVC and correct or update it by going to the My Account area on our website and clicking on [Account Maintenance](https://web.archive.org/qic/qvcapp.aspx/main.multi.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccshome,asp/left.multi.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccsmenu,asp). You can also change personal information such as your shipping address or payment method when ordering by clicking on Custom Check Out.

You can subscribe to or unsubscribe from E-newsletters and other promotional notices by going to the My Account area on the site and clicking on [E-mail Services](https://web.archive.org/qic/qvcapp.aspx/main.multi.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccshome,asp/left.multi.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccsmenu,asp).

Our Customer Service Representatives are also ready to assist you in checking or changing your personal profile or removing your name from our contact lists. You can reach them through [LiveHELP](javascript:enterLivePerson\( 'qvc', 'qvc', 'GENERAL', '' \);) or [Automated Customer Service](https://www-ssl.qvc.com/qic/qvcapp.aspx/app.html/params.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccs_help,html/left.multi.file.%7Ccshtml%7Ccs_helpmenu,asp), or by calling 1-888-345-5788 toll-free or writing to QVC, Inc., Customer Service, 1200 Wilson Drive at Studio Park, West Chester, PA 19380.

You can opt out of QVC’s use of cookies to recall information about you by setting your browser not to accept cookies or to disable cookies. You cannot access or change the non-personal information that QVC collects. However, you can opt out of the process by which certain categories of information are collected by clicking here.

What are third party affinity programs?

Occasionally, we participate in rewards programs with other business organizations where customers who are also members of these businesses will get a credit or a reward for their QVC purchases from the other member organizations. We also sometimes advertise QVC products on other websites in the form of a link so that visitors can click over to our site and purchase the products if they are interested. In these situations, we share information about our customers’ QVC purchases with these other member organizations and other websites under the contracts these entities have with QVC.

Do we collect personal information from children?

Our site is not intended for use by children, and our General Terms and Conditions require that you must be at least 18 years old to use the site. In addition, we do not solicit or collect information from anyone who tells us that he or she is under 13 years of age.
