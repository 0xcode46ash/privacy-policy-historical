# Privacy Statement â€” QVCUK.com

## At QVC your privacy is a priority

QVC does not sell or exchange customer information with anyone else. We share relevant information only with those parties entrusted with the processing of your account and the fulfilment of your order and to parties entrusted by us to undertake customer surveys. We have established procedures to protect your privacy - and we uphold them vigorously.

## Customer information is gathered so we can serve you better.

We make every effort to ensure its security and to treat your information responsibly. When you become a QVC Member, we ask for your name, address, date of birth and phone number. We also ask for your credit or debit card number and its expiry date, if you select that method for payment. Once we have your credit card information, we will not ask for it again unless a change is required. Your order history information is maintained in order to service your account. 

Credit card transactions are subject to routine searches from time to time. QVC undertakes these searches in association with licensed credit agencies to detect and prevent fraud. 

From time to time, we may write or telephone in order to update your account, or to give you information that we hope might interest you or gather feedback in order to help us improve customer service. If you don't want us to get in touch, simply tell a Customer Care Representative, or contact us at [**webmaster**](https://web.archive.org/CustomerServiceEmailView?storeId=10252&catalogId=10152&langId=-2), to have your name removed from our contact list. 

If false or inaccurate information is provided and fraud is detected, details will be passed to fraud prevention agencies. Law enforcement agencies may access and use this information. We and other organisations may also access and use this information to prevent fraud and money laundering, for example when: 

  * Checking details on applications for credit and credit related or other facilities
  * Managing credit and credit related accounts or facilities
  * Recovering debt
  * Checking details on proposals and claims for all types of insurance
  * Checking details of job applicants and employees



We and other organisations may access and use from other countries the information recorded by fraud prevention agencies. If you would like to receive details of the relevant fraud prevention agencies, please contact a Customer Care Representative, or contact us at [**webmaster**](https://web.archive.org/CustomerServiceEmailView?storeId=10252&catalogId=10152&langId=-2).

## What if I want to order over the Internet, but don't want to use 'cookies'? 

Most browsers are set to accept cookies. A cookie is a data package that your computer receives from the main server. It helps to identify the user and store information specific to the user and allows the server to customise content for users. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, but this means you won't be able to order form QVC UK.

## What steps are taken to keep my personal information private?

The information you submit to QVCUK.com is sent to us or the third party service provider(s) we use to support QVCUK.com through a 'secure session' established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). This technology encrypts (scrambles) your account information before it is sent, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than QVCUK.com to read it. Because our service provider(s) may be based overseas, your personal information may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). All information stored outside the EEA is protected by our [Safe Harbour Privacy Statement](https://web.archive.org/SafeHarbour.content.html). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA. By submitting your personal information, you agree to this transfer, storing and/or processing. We protect all customer data against unauthorised access and take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure our service providers do likewise. We and they use secure technology, privacy protection controls and restrictions on employee access to safeguard your personal information.
