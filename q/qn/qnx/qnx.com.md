# QNX Software Systems Privacy Statement

## General

QNX Software Systems Limited and members of the QNX Software Systems Group (as defined below, collectively "QSS" or "we") respect each individual's ("you" or "your") right to privacy. This statement outlines QSS' practices with respect to the processing of your personal information which includes the collection, use, processing, transfer, storage or disclosure of your personal information. To protect your personal information QSS does not sell, rent or trade your personal information except as outlined in this Privacy Statement. 

## The Context for the QSS Privacy Statement

To understand how we are going to use your personal information, you need to understand QSS. 

We are a global organization with subsidiaries, offices, agents, distributors, resellers and business partners throughout the world. The "QNX Software Systems Group" means, collectively, QSS, its affiliate, QNX Software Systems, Inc., and all of QSS' wholly owned subsidiaries. 

Our primary products and services relate to the QNX real time operating system, middleware and associated development tools (and while we do not anticipate it, this may change). Our primary customers are businesses and, as a result, we do not collect a great deal of "personal information" (specifically, information about an identifiable individual) and almost no sensitive personal information. Of course, to the extent that we do collect personal information we want to respect your privacy. 

## Collection of Personal Information

We gather personal information from a variety of sources including: 

  * directly from you, through (a) registration processes (on-line, off-line and otherwise) and (b) all forms of interaction with QSS and its employees. If you provide us with personal information regarding another person, such as a work colleague, we will assume that you have their permission to do so for the purposes(s) for which you have provided their information; and
  * indirectly from: (a) our distribution channel; (b) our partners; (c) credit agencies; and (d) governments. 



Any personal information QSS obtains from any of these sources at any time is subject to this Privacy Statement. 

## Use of Personal Information

### Sales & Marketing

Whether you are an existing or prospective customer, we use your personal information to market and sell QSS products and services to you, or more likely the organization to which you belong. This may include using your contact information to send you information about our company and our products and services, as well as associated third party products and services.

### R&D 

QSS continually develops and improves our products and supporting services. Information you provide us will be used to build and provide better products and services, including technical support. Your technical support calls and emails may be recorded or monitored for quality assurance and technical services purposes such as troubleshooting, training and analytics to identify trends and improve products and services.

### General Administration

There are thousands of things that QSS must do to run its business day to day and year to year; for example, ship you product, send and collect invoices, send and receive purchase orders, create reports, etc. Your personal information may be used in any of these contexts. We will also use your personal information to negotiate, administer and enforce our contracts and meet our legal and contractual obligations throughout the world.

### Human Resources

Our HR department manages the most personal side of our business - the people. If you are a prospective employee, our HR department (or one of their agents) may use the information you provide as part of such process throughout QSS and its related entities for the purpose of employment consideration or your inquiry.

### Partners

A real-time operating system generally sits at the center of a very complicated computer system. We have technology suppliers, licensors, partners, alliances, sub-contractors and the like whose products and services we sell or support. We may need to use and share your information to support these partners in the context of the above. 

Further, if you are a partner we may have to share your personal information with other partners or customers. 

### Distribution Channel

In certain areas of the world we do not sell our products and services directly, but do so through a channel of distributors, resellers and the like. We receive personal information from, and supply personal information to, our distribution channel in support of all the functions noted above.

In summary, QSS collects personal information for the purposes of running its business as described above, including to: 

develop, enhance, market and provide products and services; 

  * understand your needs and eligibility for products and services; 
  * recommend particular products and services to meet your needs; 
  * sell to you and provide you with ongoing products and services from QSS and its partners; 
  * provide you with information on QSS products and services and associated third party products and services; 
  * receive and respond to your inquiries and requests in any medium;
  * tailor web site content and marketing messages; 
  * compile statistics, reports and conduct market research; 
  * issue, pay and generally administer invoices, purchase orders and other documents and processes associated with the provision of goods and services; 
  * report to government bodies; 
  * do credit and background checks; 
  * negotiate, complete, administer and enforce contracts; 
  * consider you for employment, when your personal information is provided in that context; 
  * administer contests, to the extent that you enter QSS contests; and
  * meet legal and regulatory requirements. 



### Information Transfers & Sharing 

QSS is a global organization that deals with corporate affiliates, its distribution channel, licensors, partners, financial institutions, advisors, collection agencies, postal authorities, shipping companies and governments (including customs authorities) throughout the world. You understand that your personal information may be transferred and shared for the purposes identified above with such affiliates and third parties in any country where they are located. 

QSS may also disclose your personal information to others where QSS has a good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) conform to legal requirements or comply with legal process served on QSS; (2) protect and defend the rights or property of QSS; or (3) enforce its agreements with you. 

Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, QSS decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize its assets or businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or receiving it from sellers. It is QSS' practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. 

In some cases QSS uses suppliers or agents to collect, use, analyze and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is our practice to require such suppliers and agents to handle information in a manner consistent with QSS' policies.

### Children's Information

## Retention of Personal Information

QSS retains personal information as long as necessary to fulfill QSS' identified purposes or as otherwise required to comply with applicable laws. When personal information is no longer relevant or necessary for QSS' identified purposes, or required by applicable laws, we may take steps to have it deleted, destroyed, erased, aggregated or made anonymous. Consistent with good business practice, QSS may continue to evolve our controls, schedules and practices for information and records retention and destruction which apply to your personal information.

## Consent and Withdrawal 

By using the QSS website, or otherwise indicating your acceptance of this Privacy Statement (including where incorporated by reference into an agreement you have entered into with QSS), you are agreeing to the practices we have described. 

Generally, you may withdraw at any time your consent for QSS to process your personal information in accordance with this Privacy Statement, subject to legal and contractual restrictions and reasonable notice. With respect to marketing communications, you may unsubscribe by clicking the "Managing your subscriptions with QNX Software Systems" link at the end of any electronic marketing communication from QSS, or by notifying us in writing at the address provided above (to the attention of the Personal Information Protection Officer) and advising which particular types of communications you no longer wish to receive. 

Although you can use certain QSS products and services without providing us with any personal information, QSS may need to process personal information for some services, including those that require payment. As such, QSS may continue to use your personal information as may be required to provide you with the applicable services, and to the extent that QSS is contractually or legally obligated to do so or as necessary to enforce any contractual obligations you may have with QSS. If you refuse to provide QSS with the information we require or later withdraw your consent to use or disclose this information, we may no longer be able to provide you with the applicable services.
