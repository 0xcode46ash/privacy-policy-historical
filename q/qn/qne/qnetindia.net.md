This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring website addresses. This information is used by us for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of this website.

Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personal information or sensitive data through our public message boards, this information may be collected and used by others. Note: We do not read any of your private online communications.

We encourage you to review the privacy policy of websites you choose to link to from our website so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information. We are not responsible for the privacy policies or other content on websites outside of our website and our related websites.

We do not divulge, rent or lease our customer lists to third parties. We may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular product and/or service that may be of interest to you. In these instances, your unique personally identifiable information (email, name, address, telephone number) will not be divulged to the third parties. In addition, we may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to us, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. 

We shall not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political affiliations, without your expressed consent.

**Use of Cookies**

The website uses cookies to help you personalise your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programmes or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenient feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalise our website pages, or register with this website or services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customised.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually configure your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of our services or website.

**Security of Your Personal Information**

We secure your personal information from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. We also secure the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorised access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other websites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we have received it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**Social Media (Features) and Widgets**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programmes that run on our site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our website. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

**Testimonials**

We post testimonials on our website which may contain personal information. We do obtain the customer’s consent prior to posting the testimonial to post their name along with their testimonial.

In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
