### 6\. How does QxMD use “cookies” and log files?

“Cookies” are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer’s hard drive. **We use both session cookies and persistent cookies on our website to help us provide you with a more personalized experience.** Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser settings to prevent that if you would rather not store the information for future use. Disabling cookies in your browser, however, may prevent access to some parts of our website.

**As is true of most websites, we gather and use certain information automatically and store it in log files.** This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp. We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the website, to track users’ movements around the website and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. **We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our website.**

### 8\. Is this privacy statement subject to change?

**Yes. The QxMD Privacy Policy is subject to change at any time.**

By using our website, you consent to the collection and use of this information by QxMD as disclosed in this statement. If we decide to materially change our privacy practices, we will post a prominent notice of those changes on the homepage and/or send an email so that you are always kept informed of what data we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. **Please check this page for changes from time to time to make sure you are aware of our latest privacy practices.**

### 9\. Important Terms

In this policy, when we use the term “we” or “our”, we mean both QxMD and third parties with whom QxMD contracts to assist in its business operations. These contractors may, however, only access your information in furtherance of their services to QxMD and may not use or disclose your information except as permitted by QxMD.

### What is “personally identifiable” information?

When reviewing any privacy policy on the Internet, you should be familiar with the terms “personally identifiable” and “non-personally identifiable” information. “Personally identifiable information” is any information that can be used to identify, contact or locate you as an individual, as well as any additional data tied to such information. Common examples are your name and email address. Non-personally identifiable information is information — either in “profile” or “aggregate” form — that, in contrast, is not intended to identify you as an individual.
