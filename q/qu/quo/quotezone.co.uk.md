## 3 Use of your information

If you provide us with your information through this website, for instance by filling in one of the forms requesting us to compare insurance quotes, we shall use your information as set out in this privacy policy and in the notices we provide when you submit your information. By submitting your personal information, you consent to our use of the information as set out in this privacy policy and such notices. You will be able to withdraw that consent at any time by the methods described in this Privacy Policy.

In particular, we may need to collect your sensitive personal information to allow us to provide you with quotes, for instance information relating to criminal convictions or to your health. You consent to our use of such information for the purposes set out below.

If you give us your personal information, we will use it to provide you with the quote comparison information you request. We may also from time to time contact you by mail, telephone, SMS, or email to provide information that may be of interest to you, including our newsletter, special offers and details about the services we offer. If for any reason you do not want to receive any marketing communications from us then you can unsubscribe by [clicking here](http://www.quotezone.co.uk/contact-quotezone.htm) and then you can use the unsubscribe service on the contact us page. You can use that unsubscribe option at any time. If you initially decide to accept marketing e-mails from us but then change your mind you can always use the unsubscribe link in our marketing e-mails.

We advise you that insurance providers exchange information through various databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers by policyholders and third party claimants. This information exchange enables insurers to validate the information provided by you, both about yourself and any other person named on the application, and aims to reduce fraudulent claims. Insurers may use this information to consider the risk of your application.

If you provide us with your driving licence number ('DLN') via our quote form we may pass this information to the DVLA in order for a search to be carried out to confirm your (or any named driver's) licence status, entitlement and relevant restriction information and endorsement/conviction data. Carrying out these searches help insurers validate your information, preventing fraud and reducing incidents of negligent misrepresentation and non-disclosure. DLN searches may be carried out as part of your quote or at any point throughout the duration of your insurance policy. These searches will not appear on your (or the named driver's) driving licence record. You can find details of the information that the DVLA currently hold about you at [www.dvla.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/driver-and-vehicle-licensing-agency).

Some insurance providers who offer products designed for students or graduates may also undertake additional checks against higher education sources to verify your student or graduate status.

By submitting your personal information, you agree that we may for the purposes set out above disclose your information to our agents and service providers, some of which may be located outside the European Economic Area in countries providing less protection for personal data than the UK.
