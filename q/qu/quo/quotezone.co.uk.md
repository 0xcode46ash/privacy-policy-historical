# Privacy Policy | Quotezone.co.uk

Quotezone is a trading name of Seopa Limited. We respect the privacy of visitors to our website. Seopa is registered as a data controller in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.

## 1 Use of your information

If you provide us with your information through this website, for instance by filling in one of the forms requesting us to compare insurance quotes, we shall use your information as set out in this privacy policy and in the notices we provide when you submit your information. By submitting your personal information, you consent to our use of the information as set out in this privacy policy and such notices.

In particular, we may need to collect your sensitive personal information to allow us to provide you with quotes, for instance information relating to criminal convictions or to your health. You consent to our use of such information for the purposes set out below.

If you give us your personal information, we will use it to provide you with the quote comparison information you request. We may also from time to time contact you by mail, telephone, SMS, or email to provide information that may be of interest to you, including our newsletter, special offers and details about the services we offer. If for any reason you do not want to receive any marketing communications then you can unsubscribe by [clicking here](http://www.quotezone.co.uk/contact-quotezone.htm) and then you can use the unsubscribe service on the contact us page. You can use that unsubscribe option at any time. If you initially decide to accept marketing e-mails but then change your mind you can always use the unsubscribe link in our marketing e-mails.

We advise you that insurance providers exchange information through various databases, including the Claims and Underwriting Exchange (CUE), which holds a record of incidents reported to insurers by policyholders and third party claimants. This information exchange enables insurers to validate the information provided by you, both about yourself and any other person named on the application, and aims to reduce fraudulent claims. Insurers may use this information to consider the risk of your application.

By submitting your personal information, you agree that we may for the purposes set out above disclose your information to our agents and service providers, some of which may be located outside the European Economic Area in countries providing less protection for personal data than the UK.

## 2 Third parties

If you request a quote comparison through our website, we will forward the personal information you submit to selected insurers, insurance brokers and other related third parties to enable us to obtain a quote for you.

The insurers may use your personal information for their own purposes, which may include contacting you by mail, telephone or email, and any use by these insurers will be subject to the insurers’ own terms and conditions and/or privacy policies. We cannot provide a quote comparison to you unless we are able to share your personal information in this way. In the event that none of the companies we forward your information to are able to provide an online quotation, we may pass on your contact details to a small number of companies who may be able to provide an offline quotation according to your circumstances.

Also, we may share your personal information with other selected third parties that may contact you directly about their products or services. We shall give you an opportunity to choose not to share your information with such selected parties before you submit your personal information.

## 5 Credit Checks

To ensure our insurers and credit providers have the necessary facts to assess your insurance risk, verify your identity, to help prevent fraud and to provide you with their best premium and payment options, they may obtain information from third parties at quotation and renewal and in certain circumstances where policy amendments are requested.

This information includes a quotation search from a credit referencing agency. This search will appear on your credit report and will be visible to other credit providers. It will be clear that this is a quotation rather than a credit application by you to pay by monthly instalments.
