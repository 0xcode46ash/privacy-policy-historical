# Quote.com Privacy Statement

[ ](http://ad.doubleclick.net/jump/sub.quote.com.custom.ad/information_help;pg=ssite_freesvs;ser=quotecom_free_services;sbcat=home_services;cat=information_help;site=sub;sz=468x60;ord=939763597)   


> **Quote.com's Policy on Privacy**

At Quote.com, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We use the information we collect about you to process your registration and subscription requests for our services. This statement discloses the privacy practices for the entire web site. 

**What information do we collect?**

When you first register with us, we need to know your name, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone number, credit card number and expiration date. This allows us to process your registration, fulfill your service order and assign you a unique identifier and password which you will use to access our suite of services on an ongoing basis. As a registered user, you will have access to a wide range of free services exclusive to Quote.com users. You may also subscribe to a variety of additional paying services to supplement the free services offered by Quote.com. 

We may also ask for personal information when you enter a contest or other promotional feature sponsored by Quote.com and/or one of our many partners. This information is used to administer the contest and notify winners as applicable. 

**How does Quote.com use my personal information?**

Our goal in collecting personal information is to provide you, the user, with the best web experience for online financial information and our advertisers with an efficient means to reach the right audience. In our role of delivering targeted advertising, Quote.com plays the middleman. Advertisers give us an ad and tell us the type of audience they want to reach (for example, a telephone company who may want to promote their new service to users within a specific area code). Quote.com takes the ad and displays it to users meeting that criteria. In this process, the advertiser never has access to individual account information. 

We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve the design and layout of our web site and hence provide a better service to you. 

In addition, we may also use the information we collect to occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to our web site, or to alert you to new Quote.com services and special offers we think you will find valuable. 

**Will Quote.com disclose any of my personal information?**

We will not disclose any of your personal information, except as described below, or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it, or to protect the rights or property of Quote.com. 

Quote.com does disclose personal information in some limited circumstances, but this is specifically described to you when we collect this information. For example, when you sign-up for a contest or some other promotional feature. 

Under confidentiality agreements, Quote.com may also match user information with third party data. Also, Quote.com does disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for lawful purposes. 

Additionally, whenever you subscribe to one of our paying services, the information you provide, such as your credit card number and billing information, is transmitted via a secure server to our credit card processor who validates and processes your credit card payment. To put this in perspective, the process is similar to the one you experience whenever a retail merchant processes your credit card payment for merchandise that you purchased in person. 

**How does Quote.com protect customer information?**

When you first register with us, or access and make changes to your personal account information, or subscribe to a new service, we process your requests via a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the customer data we collect is protected against unauthorized access. 

**Will Quote.com use my information for direct mailings?**

Yes, but only if you give us your permission. We will send you information about our various products and services, or other products and services we feel may be of interest to you. If you would rather not receive this information, simply tell us when you first give us your personal information. 

**What about "cookies" and "IP Addresses"?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Quote.com uses cookies in various ways. 

  1. We use cookies to be reminded of who you are and to access your account information (stored on our computers). This cookie is set when you register or "log in" and is erased when you "log out" of our services.
  2. Cookies are used in Quote.com stores to help the merchant track visits to and business at its store and process the items you may have purchased there.
  3. Cookies are also used to estimate our audience size and better target ads based on user interest.
  4. Lastly advertising networks that serve ads on Quote.com may also use cookies.



Quote.com collects IP addresses for purposes of system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. 

**In Summary**

We are committed to protecting your privacy. Nevertheless, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk. We use the information we collect on the site to enable your access to our services and to enhance your overall online experience. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. 

Finally, Quote.com partners and third party Internet sites and services accessible through Quote.com or parties whom we inform are collecting data for contests or other promotional features have separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of us. Quote.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions.
