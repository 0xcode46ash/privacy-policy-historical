# QualitySmith Privacy Statement, Residential and Commercial Roofing Services

**QualitySmith Privacy Policy**  
Last updated: 5/21/2007

### We Value Your Privacy

Increasingly, online shoppers give out personal information reluctantly, knowing that they'll probably get bombarded with phone and e-mail advertising. Well, QualitySmith is different. We consider it an honor that you are willing to give us information about yourself. We share your personal information only with prescreened QualitySmith partner contractors so that they can provide estimate appointments. 

### TRUSTe Participation

To demonstrate our commitment to privacy, QualitySmith is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program, and has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build user's trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. This privacy statement covers the domain www.qualitysmith.com and its subdomains. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact QualitySmith by clicking here . If you do not receive acknowledgement of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should contact TRUSTe at http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php. TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with QualitySmith to resolve your concerns. 

### Our Privacy Policy in a Nutshell

  * Your privacy is very important to us.
  * We don't collect personal information without your knowledge - i.e. we ask for it in a form and you submit it.
  * We use cookies and beacons only for statistical analysis to improve our sites and to make our sites easier to use for return visitors.
  * In the highly unlikely event that we're required to by a court order, we have to give up personal information. Otherwise, it's kept under the tightest security possible.



### Our Privacy Policy in Detail

**Privacy and Information Gathering**

The privacy of our customers has always been of utmost importance to us at QualitySmith. We currently contract with several online partners to help manage and optimize our Internet business and communications. We use the services of a marketing company to help us measure the effectiveness of our advertising and how visitors use our site. To do this, we use Web beacons and cookies provided by our marketing company on this site (first party cookies). A cookie is a small packet of information stored on a user's computer that allows a website server to know certain information about a user, for example, how many times a user has visited the site. A web beacon is typically a transparent graphic placed on a site or in an email that allows a site to record, for example, whether a page was accessed or an e-mail opened, for statistical analysis. Our cookies and Web beacons are not tied to personally identifiable information. 

**Anonymous Information**

Information gathered using log files includes, but is not limited to, the activity of the user's browser when user is viewing the site, the site path of visitors, and the time visitors come to our site. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of our visitors, and log files are not tied to personally identifiable information. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. Our marketing company may not use any of the information gathered for their own marketing purposes. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

Information gathered using log files includes, but is not limited to, the activity of the user's browser when user is viewing the site, the site path of visitors, and the time visitors come to our site. Please note that this is not personal information, only general summaries of our visitors, and log files are not tied to personally identifiable information. By supplementing our records, this information helps us learn things like what pages are most attractive to our visitors, which of our products most interest our customers, and what kinds of offers our customers like to see. Although our marketing company logs the information coming from our site on our behalf, we control how that data may and may not be used. Our marketing company may not use any of the information gathered for their own marketing purposes. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site 

**Communications From the Site**

As described above, you will receive a telephone call from a QualitySmith representative to discuss your inquiry upon submission of your request for an estimate for any of our services. In addition, we send an email to you after completion of each estimate appointment requesting that you complete a survey about your experience and the appointment quality. The completion of this survey is strictly voluntary. You may not opt-out of receiving these critical service communications. 

**Service From Third-Party Sites**

When no QualitySmith partner contractors are available to provide estimates, your information will be transmitted to one of our trusted corporate partners for assistance in finding contractors in your area to serve you. At that point, you'll be notified of the name of that company and begin to receive e-mail and phone communications from them regarding your contractor choice. Once contacted by our corporate partner, you'll have the opportunity to opt out of their non-transactional e-mail and phone communications and your personal information will be governed by their privacy policy/terms and conditions. 

**Links to Other Sites**

This Web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by QualitySmith. Please be aware that QualitySmith is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. This privacy statement applies only to information collected by this website. 

Please note that when you link to our Affiliates program from our site you will be on a third party domain called www.sharasale.com. Any personally identifiable information collected on their site is subject to their privacy policy. 

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. 

**Testimonials**

We use testimonials on this site that are collected both offline and with an e-mailed survey that links to an online form. We receive permission to post testimonials prior to posting. In addition, if you would like your testimonial removed for any reason, please contact us by clicking here . We also ask for your permission within this survey to share your satisfaction survey answers with the individual partner contractor(s) that gave you an estimate for the purpose of improving their service. We will abide by your preferences with regards to the sharing of this information. 

**Information Storage and Access**

The information is collected and stored in a manner appropriate to the nature of the data and is provided only to contractors who have been evaluated and accepted as QualitySmith partner contractors. It is not provided to any other parties. QualitySmith uses secured server areas and advanced firewall technology to minimize the risk of individually identifiable information being compromised. QualitySmith also takes every effort to ensure that the information users provide is correct and current. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law, wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order, or legal process served on our website. 

Though you cannot access the personally identifiable information that is collected on the site to correct or update the information online, you may discuss these changes with the QualitySmith representative that calls you to follow up on your inquiry. You may also email us here . 

**Security**

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. 

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us here . 

**Changes to this Privacy Statement**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
