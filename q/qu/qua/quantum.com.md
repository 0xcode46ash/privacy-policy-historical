### Information Retention

We will retain your personal information for as long as we need to keep this information for the purposes for which it was collected or for which it is lawfully further processed and as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

### Cookies And Other Tracking Methods

In the process of browsing our sites, some information is collected automatically and may include your internet address and the number and frequency of visits to the sites. This generic information does not identify the visitor, but is used to help us improve the services offered through our sites. 

When you view our sites or advertisements, we might store some information on your computer. This information will be in the form of a “cookie” or similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive—not on our sites—to help you navigate a website as easily as possible. Cookies may uniquely identify your browser or your account, but they do not necessarily identify you personally. Cookies can also be used to help store personal information; for example, where you ask us to “remember” you or keep you logged in. Cookies can help us to better understand how users use our sites, which in turn helps us focus our resources on features that are more popular with our users. If you prefer not to receive cookies while browsing our sites, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies. If your browser permits, you can refuse a cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence or generally refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser; but some parts of our sites, including the portion that is targeted for our registered customers, may not work properly in that case. You can delete cookies from your browser; however, that means that any settings or preferences managed by those cookies will also be deleted and you may need to recreate them. Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings. 

Quantum places cookies on your browser in part to allow its vendors to collect data about your online activity and show you targeted ads for Quantum products. To learn more about cookies and other automatic data collection tools, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>

Quantum has engaged one or more affiliated and unaffiliated third-party service providers to track and analyze usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our sites. The service provider(s) set cookies on behalf of Quantum. Quantum also uses other third-party cookies to track the effectiveness of our sites and to advertise Quantum’s products and services, as well as those of our partners and affiliates. Some of the providers that track visitors to our sites are [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy), [Marketo](http://legal.marketo.com/privacy), [Crazyegg](http://www.crazyegg.com/privacy) and [Adroll](https://www.adroll.com/about/privacy). 

Our ad partners deliver ads for us and may combine the information collected or obtained from us with other information they have independently collected from other websites and/or other online or mobile products and services relating to your browser’s activities across their network of websites. 

### Do Not Track Signals

Some web browsers may transmit “do-not-track” signals to websites with which the browser communicates. Because of differences in how web browsers incorporate and activate this feature, it is not always clear whether users intend for these signals to be transmitted, or whether they are even aware of them. 

Participants in the leading Internet standards-setting organization that is addressing this issue are in the process of determining what, if anything, websites should do when they receive such signals. Quantum currently does not take action in response to these signals. 

### Security

We are committed to protecting the information you provide us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the information, we have in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard the information we collect. Of course, there is no such thing as “perfect security” on the Internet. E-mails you send us are not necessarily secure when they are transmitted to us. If your communication is sensitive or includes highly confidential information, you may want to provide it by post or via the telephone instead. 

### Changes In This Privacy Policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy policy, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances—if any—we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by e-mail, or by means of a notice on our home page.
