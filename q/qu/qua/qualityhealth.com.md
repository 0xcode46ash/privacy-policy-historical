Marketing Technology Solutions, Inc. is very aware of the need to respect, and protect the privacy of all our readers. We've built a site that gives you the power to control how much information you give to us, and how that information is used. This privacy policy ("Policy") discloses the data collection, use and disclosure practices of Marketing Technology Solutions, Inc. and its subsidiary, QualityHealth (collectively referred to herein as "QualityHealth"), in connection with the web site, [www.qualityhealth.com](https://web.archive.org/) (the "Web Site" or "Site"). 

Because this Policy pertains to information collected only directly through or from the Site, this Policy does not apply to personal information collected from offline resources and communications (for instance, if you send us a postal letter or give us a phone call). This Policy also does not apply to third party online resources to which QualityHealth websites may link, where QualityHealth does not control the content or the privacy practices. 

Marketing Technology Solutions is a Licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the internet, by promoting the use of fair information practices. Marketing Technology Solutions has elected to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe to show its commitment to your privacy. 

Please read this Policy carefully. Should you have any questions about this Policy or our data collection, use or disclosure practices, please contact us in any of the ways listed at the end of this Policy. Please also be sure to read our complete [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/termsOfUse/footer), of which this Privacy Policy is a part. 

## What is Personal Information?

The term "personal information" as used in this Policy means any information or set of information that identifies an individual. 

## What Information Do We Collect?

Since QualityHealth's purpose is to provide you with detailed health care information, we may request correspondingly detailed personal health information. Certain information that we request is necessary for us to provide one or more QualityHealth services to you. Other information is optional. However, if you elect not to provide this optional information, this choice may limit the value of the QualityHealth experience for you. For example, if we do not have your children's ages, we will not be able to provide information about their developmental stages or suggestions for age appropriate games and activities. As you can see, the more information we have about you, the more valuable the QualityHealth experience can be for you. 

QualityHealth may collect or track the e-mail addresses of visitors that communicate with the Site via e-mail and information knowingly provided by the visitor in online registration forms, information requests, the "Contact Us" section of the Site, and other online resources. We collect personal information through our registration form and also from registration information you provide to our marketing partners (for users that join QualityHealth though one of our partners). 

When you register an account on the Site, we collect your personal information including your name, email, birth date and gender to register your account, along with a couple other basic health questions, which are optional. This information is used to establish your basic account profile on the Site. Once registered, you have the options to create a profile with more detailed information. Please be aware that any information you select to include in your profile is publicly available to other users of these forums, and may be used to contact you with unsolicited messages. QualityHealth is not responsible for the personal information you select to include in your public profile. 

When you select to email, or tell a friend about the Site, we request their email address to send them a one time email inviting them to our Site. This information is not used for any purposes beyond that for which it has been provided. 

In addition, we might receive information about you from outside sources and add it to your QualityHealth membership information. We do this to improve personalization of our services (for example, providing better newsletter content, advertising or special offers that we think will interest you). We also may compare our customer list to lists received from other companies, in an effort to provide better service and avoid sending identical messages to our members. 

Even if you do not register with QualityHealth, we collect or track non-personal information including (1) the home server domain names, e-mail addresses, type of client computer, files downloaded, search engine used, operating system, and type of Web browser of visitors to the Site, and (2) aggregate and user-specific information regarding which pages Site visitors access, using tracking technologies, such as action tags or cookies. 

You may request removal of your personal information from our database at any time. Please see "Changing Your Status" below, for details. 

## How We Use the Information We Collect

We may use information collected for many reasons, including: 

to provide you with personalized information via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;

to send you, with your express consent, targeted advertising via electronic delivery and/or direct mail;

to contact you for feedback and surveys via electronic delivery and/or postal mail;

to send you general and administrative information about your QualityHealth membership via electronic delivery and/or postal mail;

for product development and marketing and promotional purposes;

to improve the content and layout of the Site;

to statistically analyze user behavior;

for editorial and feedback purposes;

to contact Site visitors regarding account status and changes to the Terms and Conditions, Privacy Statement, Terms of Use and other policies and agreements; and

to provide your contact information to QualityHealth marketing partners you have explicitly authorized us to share your information with, and whose offers you have elected to receive, whose offer(s) you have selected to receive in order for them to send you those offer(s) via electronic delivery, telemarketing and direct mail. In addition, QualityHealth may disclose personal information to its service providers who have agreed not to use or disclose the information for any other purpose and whose role is to provide support for the operations of the Site (e.g., to provide email newsletters). Please note that these partners will be instructed to contact you only if you request them to do so.

We do not send or support the delivery of unsolicited bulk e-mail (a.k.a. "spam"). 

While QualityHealth may undertake efforts to see that any third party to which QualityHealth shares, rents, sells, or otherwise discloses personal information is under a contractual obligation to use the personal information solely for the purposes for which the information was disclosed, such third parties are independent third parties over which QualityHealth exercises no control. QualityHealth is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices. 

## Market Research

You may choose to participate in market research activities through QualityHealth, including health panels and surveys. When participating in such activities, we may ask you to submit personal information such as health and lifestyle information about you and your family, including marital status and household information (spouse, children, pets, etc.); ethnicity; education; income; occupation; purchasing habits; reading habits; insurance; height; weight; physical and mental health conditions and diseases; symptoms; treatments; medications; medical devices; vitamins; health habits and participation in research surveys and clinical trials. We may combine the personal information you provide to us with research tools and information from other sources, including prescription information. We use this information to perform research, and to prepare reports and analyses for our clients. **Our reports and analyses to clients are made only on an anonymous basis.** Our clients never see any single individual's personal information and we will not use the personal information you provided during market research activities to advertise, promote, or market goods or services to you. 

## Third-party Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. It is solely the visitors' obligation to review and understand the privacy practices and policies of these other websites and of these advertisers and third parties. These companies are independent third parties over which QualityHealth exercises no control. QualityHealth is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices. 

## Cookies

QualityHealth may place "cookies" on your hard drive. Internet cookies are small text files that save data about individual visitors, save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit the Web Site, and help us to deliver personalized content and other services. Many Web browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. **You may change your browser settings to either reject cookies or notify you when a cookie is about to be placed on your computer.** Please note, however, that rejecting cookies while visiting the Web Site may result in certain parts of the Web Site not operating correctly or as efficiently as if they were allowed access to cookies. For example, if you are a QualityHealth member, you may need to enter your username and password each time you visit the Web Site. We tie your personal information to cookie information to streamline the user experience on the Web Site and keep track of your preferences. 

If we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf, these companies may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. These are standard measures that are used on most Web sites. **These third-party advertising cookies and action tags generally do not associate your personal information with any data that they gather.** Please note that these companies are independent third parties over which QualityHealth exercises no control. QualityHealth is not responsible for, and will not be liable for, their conduct, actions, omissions, or information handling or dissemination practices. 

## E-mail Links

In some instances we may include certain links in our e-mails that will allow us to monitor whether you access specific content or advertisements contained in that e-mail. When you click on one of these links, we will record that click and certain activities on the Web page associated with that link. We may use this information for various purposes, such as to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior in and to our e-mail advertisements and content. We also use it to customize the content displayed on your version of QualityHealth, tailoring it to your interests. 

## Legal Disclosure

QualityHealth may disclose information about you and your use of the QualityHealth Web Site and the QualityHealth services if QualityHealth believes such disclosure is reasonably necessary: 

(i) Comply with the law or legal process where a formal request has been made such as a request from an administrative oversight agency, civil suit, subpoena, court order or judicial or administrative proceeding; 

(ii) To protect or defend the rights or property of QualityHealth or others; 

(iii) To enforce the QualityHealth Terms and Conditions or this Privacy Policy; 

(iv) To respond to claims that the content(s) of a communication violates the rights of another. 

Also, circumstances may arise where, for business reasons, QualityHealth may decide to reorganize, or divest all or part of its business through sale, assignment, merger or acquisition. In these circumstances, personal information may be shared with the actual or prospective purchasers or assignees. In such an event, we shall provide notice of any material change to this Privacy Policy, or our services, in the manner described in the Updates section of this Privacy Policy below. 

## Reports

We periodically prepare analyses and reports reflecting visitor and member use of the QualityHealth Web Site and QualityHealth services for our internal use as well as for a limited number of our business partners. These reports include aggregate information about QualityHealth members, and in certain instances, visitors to the QualityHealth Web Site. **The information in these reports will not identify you individually.** Our business partners who have access to these reports will not be able to contact you from the information contained in the reports. 

## Give-Aways and Contests

We may conduct give-aways, contests and other promotions on the QualityHealth Web Site in which we may ask you for additional information. We use and treat this information in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Participation in such give-aways and contents is not necessary to use QualityHealth, and you may choose whether you wish to participate in any particular give-away or contest, without affecting your general use of the Site. 

## Security

**The Web Site has implemented extensive security measures in place intended to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of the information under its control.** Our hardware infrastructure is housed in a controlled access facility that restricts access to authorized individuals with positive identification. Our network access to the infrastructure is protected by a firewall protection system. Member information is backed up on a periodic basis to protect against accidental loss. When you enter personally identifiable information-e.g. registration, health profile questions, surveys-we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect your information during its transmission across the Internet. We use VeriSign digital ID to assist you with verification that you're actually using QualityHealth.com, and have not been diverted to a fake site by hackers. We restrict the access of our staff and contractors to your information. Third-party marketing partners receive your information only under the substantial restrictions, imposed by you and/or us, described elsewhere in this Policy. Our offices are protected with a key-card entry system, security guards, and other measures. 

However, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and QualityHealth will not be intercepted by others, and that information stored on our servers will be free from unauthorized access. While we have taken reasonable precautions to protect this information, you should always use discretion in what information you send to us and not expect that such information will be absolutely free from intrusion. The confidentiality of any communication or material transmitted to or from QualityHealth via this Web Site, or via e-mail cannot be and is not guaranteed. Accordingly, QualityHealth is not responsible for the security of information transmitted via the Internet. 

If you prefer not to communicate with us via e-mail, or the Internet, you can contact us by telephone at 1 (732) 452-9797; by fax at 1 (201) 332-3283; or by postal mail at 10 Exchange Place, 24th Floor, Jersey City, NJ 07302, USA. 

Please note that **QualityHealth does not request personal information by sending e-mails. We only collect such information on our website**.

Instead, please contact our [security staff](mailto:privacy@qualityhealth.com) immediately.
