PRIVACY POLICY & SECURITY STATEMENT   
  


[ Customer Service](http://www.qualitylogoproducts.com/help.htm) » **Privacy Policy & Security Statement **

Concerned about Privacy and Security on the Internet?  
Quality Logo Products recognizes and shares your concern.  It doesn’t matter if we offer the best customer service, the lowest prices and the highest quality goods in the industry if you don’t feel comfortable and safe.  Therefore, we’ve taken every precaution to ensure your credit card information is protected from unauthorized third parties.  
**  
** Why is our Web Site Secure? **  
** The SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is the most powerful encryption available online.  Any and all credit card information you send us will be encrypted, barring anyone else from reading it.  You can tell you’re in a secure area when the URL to the left of the colon starts “https” instead of “http.”  Additionally, you can look to the bottom right of most browsers and see a symbol like a lock or key.

The secure server takes the risk out of credit card transactions.  As an additional precaution, we do all order processing on software that is separate from the internet, making it impossible for anyone gaining access to your order information.  For your convenience, we will keep your credit card information on file ONLY with your authorization.  Otherwise, we will destroy it as soon as your order has been completed.  At no time is your credit card information stored in electronic format.

In addition, your credit card purchases are insured by your credit card company.  If, in an incredible rare and (unprecedented??) case, confirmed credit card fraud takes place, your issuer would limit your liability to $50 and Quality Logo Products will pay that balance.  This means there is absolutely no risk for you.  Our number one priority is to make you feel completely at ease when browsing our thousands of custom goods, requesting a sample and placing an order.

However, please note that email is NOT encrypted and is not considered a secure way to transmit your credit card information.  Our preferred method of collecting credit card information is through faxing a blank credit card authorization form we will provide.  If you do not feel comfortable with those methods, please contact any of our customer care representatives at (866) 312-5646, and they will be happy to take your order.

Your Other Information  
When you visit our Web site, we automatically recognize some information about you, including your Internet service provider. We don’t automatically recognize your name, address, email address or any other information specific to you, unless you give us that information via our online registration. Our web site technology allows us to keep track of how many times a user visits our site and what features they use, but it does not collect any personably identifiable information. The information we do collect helps us to make sure that our site is meeting yours and other customers’ needs.

Quality Logo Products does NOT share your mailing address with any third party vendors and at no time does Quality Logo Products release your email address or telephone number to any outside parties.
