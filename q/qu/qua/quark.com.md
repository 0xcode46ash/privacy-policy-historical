We respect the privacy of our customers and therefore have adopted the following set of information management guidelines. We will only use the information you provide to us in order to fulfill your product orders, including verifying your eligibility for updates and upgrades, inform you of special promotional offers, and deliver information to you that meets your needs, such as product news, updates, and new release information or that allows you special access privileges.

In order to protect the personal information you provide to us, we use Verisign’s 128-bit SSL encryption to securely and automatically accept, process and manage online payments as well as to collect and store the Personal Information you provide to us.

Only those Quark employees who fulfill your orders or requests for information are granted access to your personal information and those employees are obligated to respect the confidentiality of that information.

#### Children

We will never knowingly collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13 without first obtaining verifiable parental consent. If it comes to our attention that a customer under the age of 13 has provided personal information to us, we will remove all such information from our files. However, we may still maintain a record of that person’s name and address in a “do not register” file in order to avoid a subsequent registration.
