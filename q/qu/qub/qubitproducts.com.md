## Website Visitors

Like most web service operators, QuBit collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. QuBit’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how QuBit’s visitors use its website. From time to time, QuBit may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

QuBit also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. QuBit only discloses logged in user information under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below:
