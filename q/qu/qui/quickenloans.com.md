**Quicken Loans.com Privacy Statement**

At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. 

This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickenLoans.com (QuickenLoans.Quicken.com) Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "Quicken Loans Web site"). It serves as an adjunct to the [Intuit Online Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/jump/external.asp?dest=http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The Quicken Loans Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy. 

Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children. 

**Our Philosophy and Practices**

We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site: 

  * We provide you notice of our Web site information practices.
  * We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.
  * We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us.
  * We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration.
  * We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other privacy aspects.



**WE PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF OUR WEB SITE INFORMATION PRACTICES**.

To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. In this Privacy Statement, we tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed. 

Here is how and why we collect and use information from you: 

  * **Tools, Applications and Registration.** We provide a number of ways for you to explore your options for mortgages and loans, so you can determine which options may be the most desirable for you. You can engage a number of tools, planners, calculators and other interactive advisors, such as the online interviews without providing us your identity. We will not ask you for personally identifiable information to use these features, and do not attribute the information that you provide to you as an individual. 

However, if you want to exercise one or more of the loan options presented, we will ask you to register at the site and supply other identifying and supporting information needed to process your request. By registering, you can save information such as loan interviews and applications for later review and update. When you register, you select a member ID name by which we will know you, choose a password and provide us an e-mail address. You use the member ID name and password to gain access to your loan application information, financial profile and/or customized rates. We use your contact information to provide you with alerts and updates regarding your loan status, which is part of the Quicken Loans service. If you choose, we will also use it to send you communications and promotional materials for Quicken Loans and other Intuit products. We may supply the information you provide, on a confidential basis, to third parties, such as credit reporting services, who assist us in qualifying, processing, closing and servicing your loan.

  *  **Consumer Report.** Quicken Loans, Inc., which originates loans through the Quicken Loans Web site, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Intuit, Inc. By submitting a loan application or a request to be pre-qualified to us, you authorize us to share your consumer report with our parent, affiliates and subsidiaries only to process your loan application. You may direct us not to share such information with our parent, affiliates and subsidiaries by e-mailing us at [support@QuickenLoans.com](mailto:support@QuickenLoans.com).
  *  **Newsletters.** We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. When sending you e-mail we may automatically collect technical information that allows us to format messages to best align with your computer's capabilities. This data is used solely to enhance the presentation of the content you receive. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.
  *  **Interactive Help (Chat).** You may initiate an online interactive discussion with a Quicken Loans support professional to facilitate the completion of your loan application. We do not ask for any personally identifiable information to utilize this service, however, the contents of the dialogue are completely at your discretion.
  *  **Message Boards.** We may provide you the opportunity to engage other members and our select special guests in dialog about finances and related topics through our message boards. These dialogs occur in a public forum, so any information that you provide is considered public, non-confidential and non-proprietary. We offer you the ability to create nicknames which you may use on the message boards. Unless you disclose it, only you and Intuit will know the linkage between your nicknames and your member name. 
  * **Contests and Surveys.** From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.
  *  **Mandatory and Optional Information.** We also identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.

On these sites either Intuit or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.

In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant. 

**WE GIVE YOU CHOICES ABOUT HOW THE PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT YOU PROVIDE US MAY BE USED.**

We give you the opportunity to keep us from using or sharing the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us for purposes other than to fulfill your request or as is required to process, close and subsequently service your loan.
