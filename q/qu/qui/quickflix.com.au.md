This type of website content may contain the name of the member who submitted the review, if this constitutes part of the website content. The indexing and retrieval of such site content within search engines such as Google is beyond the control of Quickflix.

During the course of your membership, you will receive postal mail and/or emails from Quickflix that contain information relating to your account and the service provided to you as a member, including but not limited to website changes, product additions, news and current updates concerning the industry, website and account, product availability and the status of deliveries and/or returned items.

Where credit card details are transmitted, we use 128-bit encryption through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology.
