# QuickYellow - Privacy Policy

## Privacy Policy

The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to tell you what kind of information we may gather about you when you visit our site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct this information. Our policy allows you to choose what kind and how much information you provide to us and to control how we use whatever information you give us. Our goal is to provide you with a satisfying experience while allowing you to control your privacy and to give you a means to voice any questions or concerns you may have.

## Collection of information

Information is collected from you primarily to make it easier and more rewarding for you to use our services.

QuickYellow mostly collects anonymous information. For instance, we may collect information to tell us that five thousand people visit this Privacy Policy today, but we do not know their names, where they live or their date of birth — they are ‘anonymous’ to us.

### Use of anonymous information

QuickYellow automatically gathers anonymous information to monitor the use of our platform like the numbers and frequency of visitors to QuickYellow sites and its areas, very much like television ratings that tell the networks how many people tuned in to a program. We only use such data in an aggregate way. This collective data helps us determine how much our audiences use parts of the site, so we can improve our services. QuickYellow may publish or provide this aggregate data to other people.

### Use of personal information

QuickYellow will only use the personal information you have chosen to provide us for the purpose for which you provided it. QuickYellow will not use it for any other purpose without your consent.

### Cookies/Third Parties

From time to time, QuickYellow or its advertisers may send a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your Internet browser from a Web server and stored on your computer’s hard drive. A cookie can’t read data off of your computer hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system.

QuickYellow uses Cookies to store your preferences, and some of our advertisers use them to ascertain how many times you’ve seen an advertisement. Our advertisers may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your Internet browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other Web sites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended.

### No sale of personal information

Under no circumstances will QuickYellow sell or receive payment for licensing or disclosing your personal information.
