# Quixtar - Privacy Statement

Thank you for visiting [www.quixtar.com](http://www.quixtar.com/) (our "Site"). We appreciate the opportunity to interact with you on the internet and are committed to protecting and safeguarding your privacy. The purpose of this Privacy Statement is to inform you about the types of information we might collect about you when you visit our Site, how we may use that information, whether we disclose it to anyone, and the choices you have regarding our use of, and your ability to correct, that information.

**What Information We Collect and How We Use It  
**Any information we collect on our Site generally falls into the following two categories Personally Identifiable Information and Aggregate Information.

**1\. Personally Identifiable Information**  
This refers to information that lets us know specifically who you are. In general, you can visit our Site using the Visitor View function without telling us who you are or revealing any Personally Identifiable Information. As a visitor, you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number) to be shared with a Quixtar-affiliated Independent Business Owner (IBO) for the purpose of contacting you, including via email, to respond to your comments or inquiries. In such event, we might maintain a record of your contact, including such Personally Identifiable Information, in a file specific to you. We use this information to provide better service in the event that you contact us again.

**2\. Registration  
**When you register to become an authorized IBO and start your own I-commerce business powered by Quixtar, or when you register to shop online as a Member or Client, enjoying full access to the products and services available on our Site, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, address, email address, and telephone number). This Personally Identifiable Information is securely stored in your Contact Information. You are assigned an identification number and you select a password -- both are needed to enter the Site and to access your Personal Profile. At registration, IBOs and Members must also provide credit card information, which is used only to process payment of the registration fee and, generally, is not retained on our Site. As an IBO, you may voluntarily elect the Auto Renew feature, in which case your credit card information will be retained and securely stored in your Personal Profile and used to process payment of your annual renewal fee each year. If you elect Auto Renew, you will receive notice of the amount of the annual renewal fee approximately 30 days prior to any charge being made to your credit card.

**3\. Ordering**  
When you place an order for products or services, we collect Personally Identifiable Information (such as name, contact and billing information, credit card, and other transaction information). We use this information to deliver your order, process payment, and to communicate with you about the status of your order. Credit card information submitted with your order is used only for payment processing and, generally, is not retained on our Site unless you voluntarily elect to securely store your credit card information with us for your shopping convenience.

Also, registered IBOs, Members, and Clients may voluntarily elect the DittoTM service -- our automatic replenishment program that delivers products to your door as you need them -- in which case your credit card information will be securely stored in your separate Ditto Scheduled Order. The information is used only to process payment for each recurring transaction, so you do not have to re-enter the information each time.

**4\. Surveys and Promotional Activities**  
From time to time you may voluntarily provide Personally Identifiable Information to complete surveys and questionnaires or to participate in polls and personalized assessments. We use this information to improve our products and services. We may also use your Personally Identifiable Information to provide you newsletters and other marketing information we think would be of particular interest to you concerning things such as new product offers or website features. But we always give you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited promotional materials from us, and we will make every reasonable effort to honor such requests.

**5\. Aggregate Information  
**This refers to information that does not, by itself, identify you as a specific individual. Such information would include the Uniform Resource Locator ("URL") of the website that referred you to our Site, your Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a number automatically assigned to your computer whenever you surf the web), your operating system and browser type, and any search terms that you enter on our Site. Our web server aggregates this information in order to monitor the level of activity on our Site, evaluate its effectiveness, and improve the content of our Site in order to make your visit an easy and enjoyable experience.

We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, or otherwise disclose or use any Aggregate Information, provided that such information does not personally identify you. We do not correlate any Personally Identifiable Information with the Aggregate Information that we collect on our Site. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, it will be protected like any other Personally Identifiable Information under this Privacy Statement.

**Sharing Your Information**  
Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise retransmit any Personally Identifiable Information we collect online unless we have your permission. Any Personally Identifiable Information you provide to us will be stored in Quixtar databases in the United States.

**For IBOs**  
With a business powered by Quixtar, you'll receive advice and information from your own personal business advisory team -- a support network consisting of your sponsoring IBO and upline organization. To allow such communication, we may share Personally Identifiable Information with your sponsoring IBO and upline organization. They have agreed not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement. In the ordinary course of supporting your business, such information must be shared with your sponsoring IBO and upline to and including your immediate upline Platinum IBO. You have the opportunity to let us know, however, if you do not want your Personally Identifiable Information shared beyond your immediate upline Platinum IBO.

**For Members and Clients  
**To assure the highest level of personal service, we may share Personally Identifiable Information about you and your orders (excluding credit card information) with your servicing IBOs, who are committed to making sure you're pleased with the products you purchase and that you receive an overall favorable experience. Your servicing IBOs have agreed not to share your information with any non-affiliated third parties, and are obligated to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement. You have the opportunity to let us know if you do not want your Personally Identifiable Information shared with your servicing IBOs by editing your Personal Profile online after completing registration, or contacting us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below.

We may share Personally Identifiable Information you provide online with other Quixtar-related entities and/or trusted business partners with whom we collaborate, as well as those that provide services to our Site. Where we engage non-affiliated third-party agents or contractors, we will require them also to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement.

From time to time, we may be required to provide Personally Identifiable Information in response to court order, subpoena, or government investigation. We also reserve the right to report to law enforcement agencies any activities that we in good faith believe to be unlawful. We may release Personally Identifiable Information when we believe that such release is reasonably necessary to enforce or apply our Terms of Use or to protect the rights, property, and safety of others and ourselves.

Quixtar or its related entities could merge with or be acquired by another business entity, or their respective assets could be acquired. Should such a merger or acquisition occur, you should expect that we would share some or all of your Personally Identifiable Information to companies serving you and other users of our Site.

**Your Choices  
**Your permission is always secured first. We will not use or share the Personally Identifiable Information collected on our Site in ways unrelated to the purpose for which you provided the information, including those described above, without providing you a choice whether to permit any such unrelated uses.

**Accessing and Correcting Your Information**  
We take reasonable measures to ensure that any Personally Identifiable Information we collect on our Site is accurate, current, complete, and reliable for its intended use. If you wish to update or otherwise correct Personally Identifiable Information you have provided to us, you may edit your Personal Profile online after completing registration, or contact us as described in the "Contact Us" section, below.

**Protecting Your Information  
**We acknowledge your trust and are committed to take reasonable steps to protect Personally Identifiable Information you provide online from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access. We employ physical, electronic, and managerial processes to safeguard and secure your information.

It is your responsibility to safeguard the password you use to access our Site, and to promptly advise Quixtar if you ever suspect that your password has been compromised. We strongly encourage you to change your password regularly to prevent unauthorized access. Be sure to make note of your new password and keep the information in a safe place. For your security, do not share your password with others. Because your identification number and password are specific to you, you acknowledge sole responsibility for any and all use of our Site conducted with your identification number and password.

**Use of Cookies on This Site**  
A "cookie" is a small data file transferred to your computer's hard drive that allows a website to respond to you as an individual, gathering and remembering information about your preferences in order to tailor its operation to your needs, likes, and dislikes. Cookies also enable an internet retailer like Quixtar to keep track of a consumer's electronic "shopping cart" before completing a purchase. Overall, cookies are safe, as they only identify your computer to customize your web experience. Accepting a cookie does not provide us access to your computer or any Personally Identifiable Information about you, other than the information you choose to share. Other servers cannot read cookies, nor can they be used to deliver a virus.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually adjust yours (Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator) to notify you of cookie placement requests, refuse certain cookies, or decline cookies completely. If you turn off cookies completely, there may be some website features that will not be available to you, and some web pages may not display properly.

To support the personalized features of our Site (such as your country and language codes, electronic shopping cart, and other ordering and browsing functions), we must send a cookie to your computer's hard drive and/or use cookie-based authentication to identify you as a registered Site user. We do not, however, use so-called "surveillance" cookies that track your activity elsewhere on the web.

**Use of Active-X and Java Applets On This Site**  
Active-X programs and Java Applets are executable programs that can be transferred to your computer's hard drive to cause your computer to perform functions concerning your visit to a website. Our Site does not transfer any Active-X programs or Java Applets to your computer's hard drive.

**Use of Third-Party Media and Research Companies  
**Our Site may run limited third-party ads only for those Merchant and Services Partners with whom we maintain linking agreements. We do not, however, use third-party media and research companies to place ads for us on other parties' websites.

**Links to Other Websites**  
Links to third-party websites may be provided solely for your information and convenience, or to provide additional shopping for various other goods and services through our Merchant and Services Partners. If you use these links, you will leave our Site. This Privacy Statement does not cover the information practices of those websites linked to our Site, nor do we control their content or privacy policies. We suggest that you carefully review the privacy policies of each site you visit.

We maintain contractual agreements with all of our Merchant and Services Partners, which require them to observe the intent of this Privacy Statement. When you enter a Partner Store from our Site, we provide them only with your identification number for purposes of introducing you. In return, the Partner Store shares with us any purchases you make from their websites in order for us to assign proper credit to you and to your servicing IBOs.

**Children's Privacy Protection  
**We take special care to protect the privacy needs of children under the age of 13 and encourage parents to be an active participant in their child's online activities. We abide by the requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other relevant laws. Our Site does not target and is not intended for children under the age of 13, and we will not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from them. If we discover personal data from a child through our Site, we will eliminate that data.

**Changes to This Statement  
**Any updates or changes to the terms of this Privacy Statement will be posted here on our Site and the date of the newest version posted below. Please check back frequently, especially before you submit any Personally Identifiable Information at our Site, to see if this Privacy Statement has changed.

By using our Site, you acknowledge acceptance of this Privacy Statement in effect at the time of use.

**Contact Us  
**If you have any concerns about our use of your information or about this Privacy Statement, please send an email to [QBCR.department@quixtar.com](mailto:QBCR.department@quixtar.com), or call 616-787-6712.
