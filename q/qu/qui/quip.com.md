Our privacy policy

We respect your absolute right to confidentiality. Because of this, no information that you give us about your business will ever be given or sold to any other organisation under any circumstance without your permission. 

Secondly, all information that you do supply us with is held on secure servers that are hidden from the Internet behind 'firewalls'. Firewalls are highly effective barriers that protect against unauthorised entry to computer systems. Basically, no one can get to your information without your authorisation. 

Information security

We consider the information you give us about your company to be 'sensitive data'. This includes your company's bank account details. It also includes your company's address, telephone number and any other information we ask you to give us, as well as details of the calls your business makes. 

All of this information is protected by a technology called SSL (Secure Socket Layer). SSL is an industry-standard technology. All sensitive data is encrypted (turned into a code) in such a way that it cannot be read by anybody who is not authorised to do so. This system is far more secure, for example, than giving your credit or debit card details over the phone when booking cinema tickets or when paying for a meal in a restaurant. 

All websites that use SSL technology need to be certificated. In order to gain a certificate, the company behind the website must satisfy the certificating authority that it has taken all necessary measures to protect your personal information.
