# QuickBase | QuickBase.com privacy statement

At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals manage their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we want you to know how it is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickBase.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the “QuickBase Web site”). It applies to both QuickBase and QuickBooks Web Database, both of which for purposes of this statement will be referred to simply as “QuickBase”. It serves as an adjunct to the Intuit [Online Privacy Policy](http://privacy.intuit.com/policies), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBase Web site’s privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.

Because of the nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don’t knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

Our Philosophy and Practices  
At Intuit, we want you to be comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site:

|   
---  
| We provide you notice of our Web site information practices.  
| We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.  
| We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.  
| We let you update or correct your personally identifiable information.  
| We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.  
| We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.  
  
We provide you notice of our Web site information practices  
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we’ll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.  
Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:

QuickBase Registration  
When you register for a QuickBase account, we request your name, a screen name and an e-mail address to complete your registration. This is referred to as “Personally Identifiable Information.” We ask you to provide a password and a challenge question and answer to protect you from unauthorized access and alteration. We also request demographic information to help us understand our QuickBase customers. Providing your name, screen name and demographic information is optional. On occasion, we may use your contact information, such as your name, street address, and e-mail address, to send communications we think you will find useful, including information about QuickBase releases and upgrades, new Intuit products and services, or those of our partners. Intuit does not share your contact information with outside companies for their promotional use. Other than contact information [and billing information, if you have subscribed to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee], Intuit will not access, use, or share any information that you enter when using QuickBase.

QuickBase Billing  
When you subscribe to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, we request your credit card or purchase order information and billing address. Credit card and purchase order information is used solely for the purpose of billing you for QuickBase service. Credit card and purchase order information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments. We may use your contact information to alert you regarding product changes, upgrades, and other special Intuit offers. To opt out, simply indicate your preference at the time of registration, or contact us at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/)

For your convenience, we give you the option of billing your QuickBase service to a "workgroup." If you choose to join a workgroup for billing purposes, ownership of your QuickBase data will be transferred to that workgroup. The workgroup owner is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. The workgroup owner can also delete your data without your permission. However, the workgroup owner will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. For more on access privileges, please see the Database Content section below. You should also note that all workgroup members will be able to see each others' e-mail addresses in addition to their QuickBase screen names. This will increase your ability to correctly identify a QuickBase user within your workgroup, which is helpful when granting access permissions.

Workgroup owners and administrators should keep in mind that any other workgroup administrators will have access to the workgroup's billing information. Workgroup administrators will also be able to deactivate a workgroup member's user account. Please exercise caution when assigning workgroup administration rights.

QuickBase Database Content  
Any content you place in a QuickBase database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other QuickBase users, to QuickBase groups, or to the general public for that database. Intuit personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as may be required by law.

You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).

Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Intuit personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your QuickBase account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your databases if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet café.

Technical Support and Feedback  
To obtain technical support, we ask you to provide your name and e-mail address. This information may be used to contact you regarding your technical support request. We also offer you the opportunity to provide feedback. When submitting feedback to us, your name and e-mail address may be used to respond to your comments or suggestions.

More on Our General Information Practices  
Newsletters  
We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.

E-mail Message Formatting  
When sending you e-mail, we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer’s capabilities, and (2) determine whether you’ve opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, then are redirected onto the Internet. We use this click-through data in the aggregate to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer base. 

Contests and Surveys  
From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.

Mandatory and Optional Information  
We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service. If you choose not to provide mandatory information, we will not be able to provide the service you are requesting.

Intuit and Its Subsidiaries  
Intuit and its subsidiaries may exchange customer information with each other to fulfill your requests or to provide you with information about other products or services.

Intuit Partners and Co-Branded or Third-Party Sites  
Some of the products or services offered on this Web site are provided by Intuit's business partners. To fulfill your request for such services, we will forward your customer information to a partner, as necessary. When offering partner services on an Intuit or co-branded site, the partner who will receive your information will be clearly identified. The QuickBase Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites, Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.

Service Providers  
In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers, such as consultants, temporary workers, third-party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails on our behalf. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to offer or complete the service we are outsourcing.

Service Alerts and Critical Notices  
Although we respect and honor the privacy preferences you have expressed, we may nevertheless contact you to inform you of specific changes that may impact your ability to use this service or for other critical non-marketing purposes, such as bug alerts. We may also contact you to respond to your specific requests or to clarify the order information you provided to us. 

Change of Control  
Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.

Changes to Our Privacy Policy  
If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we’ll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.

Legal Disclosures  
In some cases, we may disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request.  
  
How and why we use Web technologies  
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:

Cookies  
A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The QuickBase Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to authenticate registered QuickBase users. This cookie is also used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). You do not have to accept cookies from our site. However, in order to register and subsequently log on to the site, you must accept cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. 

Web Site Usage Data  
With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data in the aggregate to better understand Web site usage, including what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting.   
  
We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide to us may be used  
We give you the opportunity to control the use of your personal information for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during the information collection process or contact us at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/). You may also use the Edit Profile page to update your preferences at any time.   
  
We let you update or correct your personally identifiable information  
We provide you the opportunity to update or correct your personally identifiable information at any time using your My User Profile page.  
  
We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration  
We use industry standard security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us.

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All Intuit employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information to only those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.  
  
We provide various ways to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy
