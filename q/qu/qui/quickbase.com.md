We want you to feel comfortable and confident when using our Web site. Therefore, we would like to share with you the following principles that govern our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site. Throughout this policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you as "personal information."

### Personal Information We Collect

The personal information we collect is described below under the heading Additional Quick Base Feature-Specific Information.

### How We Use Personal Information

When we ask you for information, we will tell you, --or it will be clear --what we need to know to fulfill your request. We will also tell you how we will use the information we’re asking for. Our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly request or receive any information from children.

Should we sell, merge or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.

We may use sources outside of Quick Base to supplement the information you give us. For example, we may validate your address using other sources. We use this data to help us maintain accuracy and provide you with better service.

### How We Share Personal Information

  * We do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone.
  * We do not share your personal information with anyone outside of Quick Base for their promotional, including marketing, use.



We have limited relationships with third parties to assist us in servicing you, for example, by fulfilling customer orders or providing customer service. These service providers are contractually required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide them. The contracts outline the appropriate use and handling of your information and prohibit third parties from using any of your personal information for purposes unrelated to the product or service for which they’ve been contracted. Vendors are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we provide to them. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, or a law enforcement request. We have business partners that provide services, some of which are co-branded. Partner services and sites are clearly identified. When you request any of these products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. This Web site may provide links to third-party sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. Because Quick Base does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personal information.

### How to Access and Control Your Personal Information

We may use your contact information to tell you about other products we think might interest you. However, if you don't want us to contact you for promotional purposes, you can tell us when you provide the information. Your contact preferences only apply to marketing contacts. We may need to communicate with you regarding the usability of your product or critical messages relating to your service or software (such as service messages, subscription renewal notices, critical notices, or legally mandated notices).

### Security of Personal Information

We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information by using industry-recognized security safeguards such as firewalls, coupled with carefully developed security procedures to protect your information from loss, misuse or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we ask for sensitive information, such as credit card numbers, we encrypt it as it is transmitted to us. Our employees are trained and required to safeguard your information and, using physical, electronic and procedural safeguards, we restrict access to personal information to those employees and agents for business purposes only. Additionally, we use internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security procedures.

### Where We Store and Process Personal Information

Quick Base is hosted in datacenters in the United States and complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Quick Base has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

### Additional Quick Base Feature-Specific Information

**Quick Base Registration**

When you register for a Quick Base account, you are required to provide certain personal and demographic information in order to set up your account. We also request optional demographic information (which helps us understand our Quick Base customers).

If you use our blog on this Web site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in this forum.

**Quick Base Billing**

When you subscribe to a level of Quick Base service requiring a fee, we require that you provide your billing address and your credit card information, including credit card number and expiration date. Credit card information is used solely for the purpose of billing you for Quick Base service. Credit card and purchase order information is not shared with third parties except as required to process payments.

Your Quick Base service is billed to an account. Quick Base recognizes the account in which your data lives as the owner of your data. The account is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. Account owners and administrators should keep in mind that if they grant another individual full administrative rights to their account, that person will have access to the account's billing information.

**Quick Base Database Access**

Any content you place in a Quick Base database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other Quick Base users, to Quick Base groups, or to the general public for that database. Quick Base personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as stated under "Legal Disclosures."

You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).

Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Quick Base personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your Quick Base account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to prevent others from accessing your databases if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place, like a library or Internet café.

**Quick Base Accounts**

Quick Base billing accounts allow access and control over database information dependent upon the roles assigned to specific members of the account.

A billing account administrator can delete your application without your permission. However, the billing account administrator will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. Quick Base users in the same e-mail domain will be able to see each other's e-mail addresses in addition to their Quick Base screen names. This increases your ability to correctly identify a Quick Base user within your company, which is helpful when granting access permissions. Billing account administrators can also deny any user access to the entire account. If an account owns the e-mail address tied to a user account, a billing account administrator can completely deactivate that user's Quick Base account. Please exercise caution when assigning billing account administration rights.

**Quick Base Developer Program**

When you apply for the Quick Base Developer Program, you are required to provide your company's address, contact information, and tax ID (or social security number) in order for Quick Base to contact you regarding the Quick Base Developer program and to properly process payments.
