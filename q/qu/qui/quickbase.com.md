# QuickBase Privacy Statement

[ ](https://www.truste.org/validate/10345) At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals manage their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. When we collect information, we want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickBase.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the “QuickBase Web site”). It applies to both QuickBase and QuickBooks Web Database, both of which for purposes of this statement will be referred to simply as “QuickBase”. It serves as an adjunct to the [Intuit Online Privacy Policy](http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBase Web site’s privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.

Because of the nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don’t knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

**Our Philosophy and Practices**

We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site:

q       We provide you notice of our Web site information practices. 

q       We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.

q       We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used. 

q       We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us. 

q       We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.

q       We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.

##  

## We provide you notice of our Web site information practices.

To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we’ll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.

Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:

q       **QuickBase Registration**. When you register for a QuickBase account, we request your name, a screen name and an e-mail address to complete your registration. This is referred to as “Personally Identifiable Information.” We ask you to provide a password and a challenge question and answer to protect you from unauthorized access and alteration. We also request demographic information to help us understand our QuickBase customers. Providing your name, screen name and demographic information is optional.

Intuit may share your personally identifiable contact information, as permissible by law, with its family of companies, all of whom adhere to the principles in this statement. Your contact information consists only of your name, street address and e-mail address. We use your contact information to send communications we think you will find useful, including information about our releases and upgrades, new products and new services. In addition, under certain circumstances, we may share limited contact information with selected third parties such as online service providers so that they may provide you with information about special offers we believe may be of interest to you. However, other than contact information and billing information, if you have subscribed to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, Intuit will not access, use, or share any information that you enter when using QuickBase.

q       **QuickBase Billing.** When you subscribe to a level of QuickBase service requiring a fee, we request your credit card information and billing address. Credit card information is used solely for the use of billing you for QuickBase service. Credit card information is not shared with third parties except as required to process monthly payments. We may use your contact information to alert you regarding product changes, upgrades, and other special Intuit offers. To opt out, simply indicate your preference at the time of registration, or contact us at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/). ****

For your convenience, we give you the option of billing your QuickBase service to a "realm." If you choose to join a realm for billing purposes, ownership of your QuickBase data will be transferred to that realm. The realm owner is responsible for payment and can transfer ownership of your data. The realm owner can also delete the data without your permission. However, the realm owner will not have privileges to view or alter the data unless you grant such access. For more on access privileges, please see the Database Content section below. You should also note that all realm members will be able to see each others' e-mail addresses in addition to their QuickBase screen names. This will increase your ability to correctly identify a QuickBase user within your realm, which is helpful when granting access permissions.

Realm owners and administrators should keep in mind that any other realm administrators will have access to the realm's billing information. Realm administrators will also be able to deactivate a realm member's user account. Please exercise caution when assigning realm administration rights.

q       **QuickBase Database Content.** Any content you place in a QuickBase database will not be publicly available unless you voluntarily choose to give permission to other QuickBase users, to QuickBase groups, or to the general public for that database. Intuit personnel will not view, use, or distribute the content of any of your databases without your prior permission or the express permission of the database owner, except as may be required by law. ****

You have control over who has access to the data in your databases. When you first create a database, only you have access. At your discretion, you may choose to allow others access to your database. You decide who gets access and at what level (view, modify and/or create).

Your database information is password protected. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Intuit personnel will not require you to divulge your password, even to provide support or assistance. Remember to sign out of your QuickBase account and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your databases if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.

q       **Technical Support and Feedback**. To obtain technical support, we ask you to provide your name and e-mail address. This information may be used to contact you regarding your technical support request. We also offer you the opportunity to provide feedback. When submitting feedback to us, your name and e-mail address may be used to respond to your comments or suggestions.

**More on Our General Information Practices**

q       **Newsletters**. We provide you the opportunity to subscribe to e-mail newsletters and other e-mail communications. You may unsubscribe by following the instructions provided in each e-mail newsletter.

q       **E-mail Message Formatting**. When sending you e-mail, we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer’s capabilities, and (2) determine whether you’ve opened an HTML e-mail. We use this data in the aggregate to evaluate response rates to our e-mail. 

q       **Contests and Surveys**. From time to time, we may offer you the option to participate in contests or surveys. If you would like to participate, we may ask you for contact information, preferences, or other information. This information may be used to conduct research, improve our offerings, or award prizes. Our contests may have separate rules and we will identify how the information that you supply will be used in each case.

q       **Mandatory and Optional Information**. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.

q       **Co-Branded and Third-Party Sites**. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both Intuit’s and a partner’s logo. The QuickBase Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites, Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.

q       **Service Providers**. In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers, such as consultants, temporary workers, third-party software developers, or outsourcers, to complete a business process or provide a service. For example, we may use service providers to deliver products, to offer online software applications, or to send e-mails on our behalf. When we employ service providers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to offer or complete the service we are outsourcing.

q       **Change of Control**. Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries.  You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.

q       **Changes to Our Privacy Policy**. If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we’ll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.

q       **Legal Disclosures**. In some cases, we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

## How and why we use Web technologies.

Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:

q       **Cookies**. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The QuickBase Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to authenticate registered QuickBase users. This cookie is also used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). You do not have to accept cookies from our site. However, in order to register and subsequently log on to the site, you must accept cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies. 

Advertising networks may serve ads on this Web site and they may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/privacy.asp?topic=privacy&).

q       **Web Site Usage Data**. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. 

## We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.

We give you the opportunity to keep us from using or sharing the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us for purposes other than to fulfill your request. We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it. Simply notify us during the information collection process. At any time, you can use the Edit Profile page to update your preferences. 

## We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us.

We provide you the opportunity to update or correct your personally identifiable information at any time at your My User Profile page or by contacting us at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/).

## We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.

We employ industry standard security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our Web site, we support SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us.

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site’s servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information only to those employees who require the information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.

## We provide various ways to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.

Questions regarding the QuickBase Web site’s privacy statement, our online privacy policy, our information practices or other aspects of privacy on our Web site should be directed to us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/privacy.asp?topic=privacy&).
