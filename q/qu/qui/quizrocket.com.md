QuizRocket delivers to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use the Website. However, QuizRocket also allows other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within and/or on the Website. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad networks' servers, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the Website. In addition, QuizRocket uses third-party service provider partners to employ anonymous cookies for accounting and data integrity purposes. 

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server and/or third-party service provider from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's and service provider's website individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). Note that disabling cookies may limit, or in some cases, preclude your use of this site.
