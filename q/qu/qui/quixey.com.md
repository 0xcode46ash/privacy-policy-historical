# Quixey Privacy and Terms

## Privacy Policy

We have updated our privacy policy.

Effective: September 10, 2014 ([view prior version](https://web.archive.org/privacy052014/))

This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personal information such as name, phone number, email address, and location information (“Personal Information”) that we gather when you are accessing or using the Site and Services owned and operated by Quixey Incorporated (“Quixey”). Our Services are designed to optimize your mobile experience by surfacing or suggesting application functionality in response to your searches on your mobile device. To accomplish this, we gather various types of Personal Information from our users and use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, as explained in more detail below. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third-party services that you may access through our Services.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “Site” means our website available at [www.quixey.com](http://www.quixey.com/); “Services” means the services provided through the Site, platform, widget and mobile applications.

In some instances, Quixey acts as a service provider for companies that use our Services for processing of their customers’ information (“Clients”). In these instances, we collect and process information under the direction of our Clients, and have no direct relationship with the individuals whose Personal Information we process. If you are a customer of a Client using our platform, please contact the Client that you interact with directly.  We may transfer personal information to companies that help us provide our Services. Transfers to subsequent third parties are covered by the service agreements with our Clients.

This Privacy Policy is part of the [Quixey Terms of Service](https://www.quixey.com/terms/) . By continuing to use our Services, you agree to be bound by both policies, so please read them carefully.

**Information We Collect**

We collect information from you in various ways when you use our Site and Services. We may also supplement this information with information from other companies. The following are the specific types of information you give to us:

**Information You Decide to Provide** :  If you decide to contact us by email through the Site, we may collect your name, company name, email address and telephone number and other Personal Information that you submit to us. Similarly, if you desire to have access to certain sections of the Site, you may be required to become a registered user and to submit certain Personal Information to us to allow you to use certain features of the Site.

**Information Collected Through Your Use of the Services:**  When you use our Services we automatically collect specific information such as the Services and applications that you use, how you use them, and the device you are using them from. This information includes:

  * **Log Files:**  When you use our Site or Services, our servers automatically receive and record certain information from your browser and computer or device, such as your web request, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and URLs, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, and pages viewed.
  * **Use Information:**  In addition our servers automatically receive and record information about how you use our Services, such as your search queries, how you interact with the search results, and which features of our application or widget you use and how you use them.
  * **Device Information:**  Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically collect device-specific information such as a device identifier, device model, user settings, the operating system and version, device type and manufacturer, wireless carrier or operator, and network type, as well as other information about your use of our Services.
  * **Application Information** : We may also index and collect information about the mobile applications that you have installed or may access on your mobile device, such as application names, application identifiers, installations/uninstallations, and usage statistics (including, for example, number of times apps are opened or actions taken using the Services). You may change this default behavior in the settings.
  * **Location information:**  We may also collect and process information about your actual location, such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use sensor data from your device that provides information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.  You may change this default behavior in the settings.
  * **Personal Search:  **Certain portions of the Services may enable you to extend your search for relevant application functionality to content on your device (“Personal Search”). If you enable Personal Search, we will provide search results based on your contacts, calendar, texts and other content on your device (“Personal Search Data”) but will not transfer Personal Search Data to Quixey. You may change this behavior in the settings.
  * **Email Address** : When you use our Services on a mobile device, we may collect your email address and anonymize it through one-way hashing.
  * **Third Party Account Information** :  Certain portions of the Services may enable you to search your personal content on third-party sites. If you provide your third-party account credentials to us, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted to us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy. For example, if you provide us account information about your Facebook account, our Services will be able to access your basic information on Facebook.
  * **Cookies and Anonymous Identifiers:  **Quixey uses cookies and other anonymous identifiers to enable session and state management. We may send one or more “cookies” – small data files – to your computer to uniquely identify your browser and improve your use of our Services.  A cookie may convey anonymous information about how you use our Services, but does not collect Personal Information about you. A persistent cookie remains on your device after you close your browser so that it can be used by your browser on subsequent uses of our Services.  Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser.  You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent, however, some features of our Services may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.  We may also use clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) which are used to track the online usage patterns of our users anonymously.  No personally identifiable information is collected using these clear GIFs.  In addition, we may also use clear GIFs in HTML-based emails sent to our users to track which emails are opened by recipients. This information is used to enable more accurate reporting and make our Services better for our users.



**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We use the information we collect to personalize the Services for you, including providing results that may be relevant based upon your location or your use of applications or features on your device. We also use this information to suggest new applications that may interest you. We also use the information to provide, maintain, protect and improve the Services; to develop new services; to analyze how you use the Services; to protect our servers and users; and to offer you personalized content.  For example, we may use the information we collect:

  * to provide our Services and any information you request;
  * to respond to your emails, comments, and requests; and to provide customer service;
  * to personalize and improve our Services and your experience when you use our Services;
  * to increase the functionality and user friendliness of our Services;
  * to monitor and analyze usage and trends of our Services and third-party services;
  * to send you confirmations, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages and otherwise facilitate your use of, and our administration and operation of, our Services;
  * to send or display, or facilitate the sending or displaying of, push notifications or advertisements tailored to your interests; and
  * for the purpose for which the information was collected.



In addition, if you decide to provide Personal Information about yourself via the Site or if you use our Services on a mobile device, we may use your email address to send you Service-related notices (including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail). We may also use your Personal Information to send you marketing messages. If you do not want to receive such messages, you may opt out by following the instructions in the message.

We also may aggregate your data with other users’ data in non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and anonymized form to analyze and improve the Quixey Services. Aggregate data is information we collect about a group or category of services or users from which individual user identities have been removed. In other words, no Personal Information is included in aggregate data. Aggregate data helps us understand trends in our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our services. This Privacy Policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate data, and, as explained in further detail below, we may share aggregate data about our users with third parties for various purposes, including to help us better understand our users’ needs, improve our services and for advertising and marketing purposes.

**Information We Share with Others**

We may share the information we have collected from you:

  * when you give us your consent to do so, including if we notify you that the information you provide will be shared in a particular manner and you provide such information;
  * with service providers who are working with us in connection with the operation of our Services (these service providers may have access to your Personal Information but only to the extent necessary to perform services on our behalf and are subject to this Privacy Policy and obligated not to disclose that information or use it for any other purposes);
  * if you decide to use certain third-party services that require the sharing of information;
  * when we reasonably believe that we are legally authorized or required to do so or that doing so is reasonably necessary or appropriate to comply with a law, regulation or to respond to lawful requests or legal authorities, including responding to subpoenas, warrants or court orders;
  * if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues;
  * to enforce or apply this Privacy Policy, our Terms of Service or other policies or agreements or to protect our rights or property; and
  * in connection with any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition, or in any other situation where user information may be disclosed or transferred as one of our business assets.



We may also share aggregated or anonymous information (about you but doesn’t identify you):

  * for usage analytics to help us and our partners and Clients better understand who is using our Services and how;
  * to improve the relevancy of the ads you see on our Services and to tailor them to your interests; and
  * for industry analysis, demographic profiling, research, analysis and other similar purposes.



**Information Collected and Used by Third Parties**

**Third Party Analytics:  **We may use analytics providers to help us understand the use of our Services. These providers will also collect the information sent by your mobile device or browser, and their use of that information is governed by their applicable privacy policy. We use Google Analytics and have enabled Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. We use the reports we receive from Google Analytics to analyze usage patterns of Quixey’s Services and aggregate Quixey user demographics.  Google provides access to your [Ads Settings](https://www.google.com/settings/ads) to enable you opt out of Google Analytics features. For web browsing, Google also provides a [browser add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/) that users can download and install to prevent their data from being collected and used by Google Analytics.

**Third Party Advertisers:**  We may allow third-party advertisers to serve advertisements on our Services. These third-party advertisers may use technology to send the advertisements and links that appear on our Services directly to your browser or mobile device. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies, JavaScript, or web beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize the advertising content. We do not provide any personally identifiable information to these third-party advertisers without your consent. Our Privacy Policy does not cover the information practices of other companies and organizations who advertise on our Services, and who may use cookies, web beacons and other technologies to serve and offer relevant ads. To learn more about behavioral advertising or to opt-out of this type of advertising for participating ad networks, you can visit the [Network Advertising Initiative](http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/) or the [Digital Advertising Alliance](http://www.aboutads.info/choices).

**Third Party Services:**  Our Privacy Policy does not apply to the products and services you select that are offered by other companies or individuals, including products or applications that may be displayed to you in search results; products and services that may include our Services; or other products and applications linked from our Services.

**How We Protect Your Information**

We use physical, managerial, and technical safeguards that are designed to preserve the integrity and security of your information. We encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or guarantee that your information on our Services may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, managerial, or technical safeguards. You should not provide any sensitive information about you or others via the Site.

Aggregated and anonymized information may remain in our records after deletion of such Personal Information. We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally.

When acting as a service provider, Quixey will retain Personal Information and the data we process on behalf of our Clients for as long as needed provide services to our Client. Quixey will retain and use this Personal Information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

We may need to process your Personal Information on our servers in countries around the world, which may not be located in the country where you live.

Quixey complies with the U.S. – E.U. and U.S. – Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries and Switzerland.
