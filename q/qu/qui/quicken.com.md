Quicken.com respects your privacy. Our goal is to be your trusted, objective source for financial information so that you can make the most of your money. Our privacy policy is to **disclose** to you what customer information we gather and how we use it, give you complete **choice** over what personal information we use for different purposes, and provide **access** to the information we have in order to allow you to review or correct your information.

**When you visit our website, what information do we gather about you and how do we use it?**

The more we know about you, the more value we can offer you. We use the information you provide during voluntary registration to offer you personalized collection, filtering, and delivery of information that is of the greatest interest and value to you, such as stock quotes and news articles. To provide these personalized services, Quicken.com assigns a random number to each user. This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a 'cookie.' Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. You can be assured of complete anonymity: Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know who you are, even though we may assign the browser on your computer a cookie. You may [choose not to accept the cookie](http://help.netscape.com/kb/client/970226-2.html) that is passed to your computer, although then customized content such as the personalized stock portfolio may not be available to you. 

You have complete choice over what information you provide during Quicken.com registration. You never have to provide your preferences. However, this may limit what services we can offer you (for instance, we cannot offer you a personalized stock portfolio tracker if you do not tell us what stocks you wish to track). You may access and change your registration information at anytime: 

  * Update your [personal information.](http://reg.quicken.com/mps/profile_login/?brand=quicken_bandi&targeturl=http://www103.quicken.com/support/privacy/&pname=pfp)

  * Change your [Quicken.com Financial Forums channel preferences.](http://boards.excite.com/go.webx?25@-2^1@.eeded17)

The cookie is also used for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns in order to provide the most value to you. Overall, aggregated usage information helps us improve Quicken.com's offerings by showing us how different areas of the site are being used. Usage information may also be used to target advertising so customers view ads, which have the most relevance for them.

You can choose to [update your e-mail address](http://reg.quicken.com/mps/profile_login/?brand=quicken_bandi&targeturl=http://www103.quicken.com/support/privacy/&pname=pfp) at any time.
