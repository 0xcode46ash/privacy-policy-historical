4\. When do we share your information?

We understand that you are entrusting us with your personal information. **That's why we don't sell, rent, or share any of the personal information you provide to us with companies outside of Intuit for their own promotional or marketing use.** There are occasions, however, where we must share your information to provide you with the services you requested or for legal reasons.

Service providers who host web pages and collect information on our behalf are strictly prohibited from using your information for their own purposes and must comply with the practices outlined in this privacy statement. Our contracts restrict service providers to use the personal information we disclose to them only to provide you the service you have requested.   

  * **With Partners.** We have limited relationships with third party business partners to offer you products or services that we believe you may find beneficial. Some of these are "co-branded" products or services, like our Quicken Credit Card, which is offered through a partnering financial institution. We clearly identify partner services and sites, so you will know who is receiving your information. When you request any of these partner products or services, you are permitting us to provide your personal information to the partner to fulfill your request. We may also offer links to partner or other third party Web sites. We do not control the privacy or security practices used on these sites.

Unless you have asked us not to contact you, we may occasionally use your contact information to update you about new products we believe you may be interested in. **We do not share the personal financial information that you enter into the Quicken.com Investing Center or Quicken Bill Pay services with subsidiaries.**   

  * **Sale of a Business.** Should we sell, merge, or transfer any part of our business, part of the sale may include your personal information. If so, you will have the opportunity to ask not to receive promotional information following any change of control.   

  * **For Legal Reasons.** In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena, search warrant, law enforcement request, or as otherwise permitted by law to comply with legal requirements.
