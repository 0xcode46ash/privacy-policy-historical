# QuickBooks.com: Privacy Statement

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/8257)At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals manage their financial lives and small businesses manage their business. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. When we collect information, we want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to QuickBooks, QuickBooks.com, QuickBooks for the Web, and affiliated Intuit Web servers (together referred to as the "QuickBooks Web sites"). It serves as an adjunct to the [Intuit Online Privacy Policy](http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBooks Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.

Because of the financial nature of our business, our products & services are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

Our Philosophy and Practices  
We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our product & service offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web sites:

  * We provide you notice of our information practices.
  * We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.
  * We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used.
  * We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us.
  * We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration.
  * We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy.



We provide you notice of our information practices.  
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites or register our products. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.

Whenever you register a product or service, we request certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and company name. We use this information to notify you about upcoming product upgrades and about special offers available to registered users. Intuit may share this personally identifiable information, as permissible by law, with its family of companies, all of whom adhere to the principles in this statement. In addition, under certain circumstances we may share limited contact information with selected third parties such as companies offering training services for our products, financial institutions and selected online service providers, so that they may provide you with information about special offers we believe may be of interest to you.

Here is how and why we use some common technologies to help manage our Web site:

  * QuickBooks 2001 Software, U.S. Version
  * Automatic QuickBooks Product Update
  * QuickBooks for the Web
  * QuickBooks Service Center
  * QuickBooks Site Builder
  * QuickBooks Site Center
  * QuickBooks Shopping Source
  * QuickBooks Merchant Account Service
  * QuickBooks Online Billing
  * Technical Support, QBSN, and Customer Service
  * QuickBooks Affiliate Program
  * QuickBooks Developer Opportunities
  * QuickBooks Universal Login
  * Contests and Surveys
  * Newsletters
  * Submitting Suggestions



We tell you how and why we use Web technologies.  
Here is how and why we use some common technologies to help manage our Web site:

Cookies. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. QuickBooks products & services supply your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). Except in registered areas these cookies are not linked to the personally identifiable information that you provide us elsewhere on the site. You do not have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration require cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.

When you use the [QuickBooks Universal Login](https://login.quickbooks.com/) for one of the QuickBooks services, you will receive a cookie as part of the personal identification process. This cookie will be used to confirm your identity each time you wish to access one of our services. The cookie enables you to go from screen to screen without being repeatedly asked to authenticate your identity.

Third party tracking systems in use on behalf of this Web site may assign different cookies to you. These cookies may be used to track your involvement with certain links on our site to help us better understand and improve our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies and will still have full access to site functionality. These cookies do not follow you once you leave our site, nor are they linked to personal information you provide elsewhere on our site. If you have any questions about our third party tracking system, please contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](mailto:privacy@intuit.com).

  * Web Site Usage Data. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.
  * Co-branded and Third-Party Sites. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The QuickBooks products & services may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information.
  * Links to the Internet. Newer versions of QuickBooks software are "Internet enabled," allowing us to deliver products, services and information via the World Wide Web. In providing these services, your QuickBooks software will sometimes link to Web sites on the Internet after you click on a link or a message within the QuickBooks software. Links leading to the Internet are distinguished by a lightning-bolt icon. After clicking on one of those links, you will pass through an Intuit server before being "re-directed" onto the Internet. This allows QuickBooks to send you to the proper Web site even if the destination Web site has changed locations. We store which message you clicked on and its location within the software prior to linking you to the Internet. Intuit servers register the Web site you request from within the software. Intuit does not register your surfing behavior after that point. We use this information, in the aggregate, to determine usage levels for our various on-line services. 



More on our general information practices:

  * Mandatory and Optional Information. We identify the information that is necessary to fulfill your request. Whenever we ask for additional or optional information, we identify those fields appropriately so that you know what is required to provide the requested service.
  * E-mail Message Formatting. When sending you e-mail we may use an image called a single-pixel GIF, that allows us to (1) format messages that best align with your computer's capabilities, and (2) determine whether you've opened an HTML e-mail. When you click on a link within an e-mail message, you will first pass through our server, then be redirected onto the Internet. We use this data on an aggregate level to evaluate response rates to our e-mail messages and to determine which links are most useful to our customer base.
  * Service Providers. In some cases, we will employ or work with service providers such as consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service on our behalf. For example we may use service providers to deliver products, offer online software applications, or send e-mails. When we employ service providers we may need to share your personally identifiable information. Service providers are strictly prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to act on our behalf.
  * Change of Control. Your personally identifiable information may be transferred in connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange or other disposition (whether of assets, stock or otherwise) of all or a portion of a business of Intuit and/or its subsidiaries. You will have the opportunity to opt out of further secondary use of your information following any change of control.
  * Changes to Our Privacy Policy. If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to the QuickBooks.com Web site 30 days before they take effect.
  * Legal Disclosures. In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.

We will provide you the opportunity to opt-out of such secondary uses of personally identifiable information you provide us, whenever we gather it.

We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration.  
We employ industry recognized security safeguards to help protect the personally identifiable information that you have provided to us from loss, misuse, or unauthorized alteration. Whenever we prompt you to transmit sensitive information, such as a credit card number, to us through our products or services, we support encryption of your data as it is transmitted to us.

We work to protect personally identifiable information stored on the site's servers from unauthorized access using industry standard computer security products, such as firewalls, as well as carefully developed security procedures and practices. All employees must review and sign a written statement of these practices, which include limiting access to sensitive information to those employees who require such information and enforcing strict password protocols for all employees. We use both internal and external resources to review the adequacy of our security measures on a regular basis.

When you purchase QuickBooks 2001 we require you to register your purchase. During the registration process we require your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and company name. We use this information to notify you about upcoming product upgrades and about special offers available to registered QuickBooks users. In addition, under certain circumstances we may share limited contact information with selected third parties such as companies offering training services for our products, financial institutions and selected online service providers, so that they may provide you with information about special offers we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive notification of future product upgrades and be eligible for special offers, you may opt out of contact at the time of registration. After registration, you may contact us regarding your privacy preferences at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/) or write to us at: 

> Intuit Inc.  
>  Customer Communication  
>  2800 East Commerce Center Place  
>  Tucson, AZ, 85706

After completing the product registration process, we provide you the opportunity to create a [QuickBooks Universal Login](https://login.quickbooks.com/). The QuickBooks Universal Login verifies your identity and will allow you to enjoy faster access to QuickBooks branded product and services.

Finally, we request that you answer some general questions about yourself and your business and how you use the QuickBooks product. This information will help us continue to improve our products and services to better meet your needs. Answering these questions is optional, and you will be able to register your product without completing these sections. If you choose to provide Intuit this information, we may use it to contact you about special offers that may be of interest to you. This information may also be used in aggregate form to help us evaluate our products and services.

Back to How and Why We Collect and Use Information  
  
Intuit works year-round to make QuickBooks better. From time to time, we place updates on our Web site for customers to download. An update might include a timesaving new feature, minor repairs to keep software running smoothly, or timely information relevant to customers' businesses.

You can obtain these downloads in two different ways. The easiest is by using QuickBooks' Automatic Update feature. When an important update is available, QuickBooks uses the current Internet connection to download and install the update. Everything happens in the background, without disturbing current tasks or slowing down the computer. The software is updated while you work.

With the Automatic Update feature, QuickBooks only connects to Intuit servers when you are already connected to the Internet. The update feature uses a secure connection to transmit technical information to Intuit about the computer's connection and the QuickBooks software being updated. Under no circumstances do Intuit servers access or read any other information on your computer. During an update, QuickBooks downloads only the necessary files to the PC.

You always have the option of turning off this feature. To do this, go to the "File" menu within QuickBooks, select "Update QuickBooks" then click the "Update Options" link and follow the instructions. You will still be able to get the latest updates manually by visiting <http://www.quickbooks.com/support/updates.html>.

We gather information from you at various times during your usage of the product. Below we detail the point at which we take the information, what information we gather and how we use the information.

We may use your contact information to alert you regarding product changes, upgrades, and other special Intuit offers. To opt out simply indicate your preference at the time of registration, or contact us at [http://privacy.intuit.com](http://privacy.intuit.com/). We also collect information about your business, such as your industry, the number of employees you have, the type of ownership structure of your business, and outstanding loans your business may have. We use this information to customize the Chart of Accounts so that it accurately tracks the kind of activity your business will have, such as loan payments or tax filings. Lastly, we ask you to setup a Login Name, Password and Challenge Questions for use in logging in to QuickBooks for the Web. Your password is encrypted on our servers, and no Intuit employee has access to it. QuickBooks for the Web utilizes the [QuickBooks Universal Login](https://login.quickbooks.com/) process to simplify your access to this and our other services.

General Product Use: No financial information you enter when using QuickBooks for the Web will be used or shared except as required to fulfill a service you request.

Billing/Subscription: We collect your credit card information, solely for the use of billing you for QuickBooks for the Web.

Additionally, QuickBooks for the Web uses its server logs to gather usage information. This allows us to better understand product performance, activity, and utilization. The information is used in the aggregate to improve the product.

QuickBooks for the Web takes many precautions to safeguard your company information. You must access our product through a secure connection, protecting your information as it travels over the Internet. Also, our servers are backed up nightly, and those backups are stored remotely so that your information is safer in the event of a natural disaster.

Managing the Company: This feature allows company administrators to update company and user information such as company name, login name, address, phone number, e-mail, as well as add or delete users and specify user rights. User login name and e-mail address are used to notify the user of changes in access or use rights.

The QuickBooks Shopping Source allows you to purchase a variety of goods and services. QuickBooks provides an entryway into the service, but does not actually execute the product search or the order fulfillment.

To utilize the service, the company and individual purchasers must register at the time of purchase on QuickBooks Shopping Source. The information required to utilize the service to execute an order is company name, address, phone number, and e-mail. We additionally ask for your company's URL and Duns# which may be supplied on an optional basis. The required information is used to register your company to utilize the service. The optional information is requested in the event that you may want to offer your own products or services through this virtual marketplace. Additionally, the name, phone number, and e-mail for each authorized purchaser will be required to purchase items. Metiom, Inc., provider of the shopping functionality, will only use the information you share in aggregate form. If you choose to utilize the service by purchasing items, your personally identifiable information will be shared with the vendors you've chosen so they can gather the information required to collect payment and deliver the requested products to you. At the time of the transaction, additional personally identifiable information may be gathered. The information shared during a transaction may only be used by the vendors to market products or services to you within the QuickBooks Shopping Source and then only with the approval of Intuit, subject to the privacy preferences defined by you.

Back to How and Why We Collect and Use Information  
  
The QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to accept payment by credit card from your customers. In order to utilize this service your company must apply for a merchant account with one of our merchant bank partners. To apply for the Merchant Account Service, you will be required to supply the bank your company name, address, phone number, e-mail address, description of your products and/or services and detailed financial and operational information on your company. This information is used by the merchant bank for making a credit decision on your application. If they extend you credit, you become their customer and become subject to their privacy practices. Please see their privacy statements for further details on their practices.

If your application for an account is approved, information sufficient to uniquely identify your account is shared by our merchant bank partner with our Internet transaction processor partner, and then forwarded to Intuit. This information includes company name, address, phone and e-mail address. This information is used by the Internet transaction processor partner only for the purpose of fulfilling the transaction. The e-mail address is only used to confirm your account and to provide critical service announcements.

QuickBooks Merchant Account Service allows you to download customer payments directly into QuickBooks thereby avoiding having to reenter transaction information. To enable this service the Internet transaction processor and merchant bank partners forward transaction information to an Intuit server from which you may download the information at your convenience. QuickBooks may use this information to track our partner's performance and to improve the design and functionality of this service.

The QuickBooks Online Billing service allows your customers to pay you online when you e-mail them your invoices. To use this service, both you and your customers must apply for an account with PayPal, the company that we have teamed with to facilitate online payments. The information collected during the PayPal registration process is governed by the PayPal privacy policy and will be used to facilitate online payments. This information may also be used in aggregate form to help us evaluate our products and services.

|  | 

E-mailing Invoices With Online Billing. When you e-mail an invoice that is enabled for online payment, all invoice data (including items, quantities, terms, customer information and amounts) is transmitted via a secure connection and stored on Intuit's servers. Storing this information allows us to create the Web site your customers will access to pay your invoices. Intuit only uses the stored data to make Online Billing faster and easier for you and your customers. Intuit also shares invoice data with PayPal, as necessary to fulfill the service. If you choose not to store information on Intuit servers or allow PayPal limited access to invoice data, you will not be able to use the Online Billing service.

E-mailing Invoices Without Online Billing. When you e-mail an invoice that is not enabled for online billing, your e-mail is transmitted via a secure connection to Intuit for formatting prior to delivery to your customer. Intuit's servers do not store the contents of invoices that are not enabled for Online Billing. Under these circumstances, Intuit only stores limited information (the from, to, cc, and subject line fields) for support purposes, such as confirming that an invoice has been sent. This information may also be used in aggregate form to help us evaluate our products and services.
