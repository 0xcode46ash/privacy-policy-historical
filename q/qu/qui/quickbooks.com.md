# QuickBooks.com: Privacy Statement

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/8257)At Intuit, we dedicate ourselves to revolutionizing the way individuals and small businesses manage their financial lives. In that effort, we respect and protect the privacy of those who visit or use our Web sites. We want you to know how your information is used. To demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices, we have adopted leading industry privacy guidelines. Intuit is a Premier Sponsor of TRUSTe and a member of the TRUSTe Privacy Program.

This privacy statement defines privacy aspects specific to the QuickBooks.com Web site and affiliated Intuit Web servers (referred to as the "QuickBooks Web site"). It serves as an adjunct to the [Intuit Online Privacy Policy](http://privacy.intuit.com/policies/), which represents our general privacy philosophy and governs all of our Web sites. The QuickBooks Web site's privacy practices are consistent and compliant with that policy.

Because of the financial nature of our business, our Web sites are not designed to appeal to children under the age of 13. Therefore, we don't knowingly attempt to solicit or receive any information from children.

Our Philosophy and Practices  
We want to give you the comfort and confidence you need to fully participate in our online offerings so that we can better serve your needs. Therefore, here are the principles governing our information practices and other privacy aspects of our Web site:

  * We provide you notice of our Web site information practices. 
  * We give you choices about how the personally identifiable information that you provide us may be used. 
  * We let you update or correct the personally identifiable information that you provide us. 
  * We work to protect personally identifiable information from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. 
  * We provide various ways for you to contact us about our information practices and other aspects of privacy. 



We Provide You Notice of Our Web Site Information Practices  
To maximize the value of our services, we may request information from you when you visit our Web sites. When we collect information from you, we'll tell you what is being collected, how it is collected, by whom it is being collected, why it is being collected and to whom it may be disclosed.

Here is how and why we collect and use information from you:

  * Submitting Suggestions. Using our Web site, you can ask us questions and share comments with us. Through our submission request form, we provide you a chance to send specific questions or comments and we request, at your option, a name and e-mail address, so that we may respond to your inquiry. All submissions through this form are treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary, and may be published or used by Intuit for other purposes.
  * QuickBooks Site Builder Registration. We provide you the opportunity to build and register your own Web site using QuickBooks Site Builder. During the registration process, we request your name, address, phone number, fax number (optional), and e-mail address. We need the name, address and phone number information to build your site and to register it with the Web's domain name registrar. Failure to supply this information will result in an inability to complete your site and register your domain name. The e-mail address you supply is published on the site you build, is used to forward customer e-mail to you and is the way we contact you with news and service information about your site. If you do not want to receive our QuickBooks Site Solutions Newsletters, you may opt out during the registration process or follow the instructions contained in each newsletter. We will occasionally share your name and mailing address with selected third parties. To opt-out simply indicate your preference at the time of registration.

We also ask you to provide a Company ID, User Name, Password and a challenge question and answer to protect you and your site from unauthorized access and alteration. This information is used to identify you as the owner of your personalized site.

  * QuickBooks Site Center. After building your Web site using QuickBooks Site Builder, we give you the opportunity to update your site and to sign up for special offers from our partners. If you wish to access QuickBooks Site Center from the web and have not done so previously, we will ask you to provide a Company ID, User Name, Password and a challenge question and answer to protect you and your site from unauthorized access and alteration. This information is used to identify you as the owner of your personalized site. The personal information you share on the co-branded sites or our partners' private labeled pages will be subject to our partners' privacy practices. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of these partners before signing up for the services.

How We Use Web Technology:  
Here is how and why we use some common Web technologies to help manage our Web site:

  * Cookies. A "cookie" is a small piece of information that our Web site may provide to your browser while you are at our site. The QuickBooks Web site supplies your browser with cookies that contain a unique identifier used to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). These cookies are not linked to the personally identifiable information that you provide us elsewhere on the site. You do not have to accept cookies from our site. Only the areas that require registration require cookies. Most browsers are defaulted to accept and maintain cookies.

If you sign up for QuickBooks Site Solutions, you will receive a cookie as part of the personal identification process. This cookie will be used to confirm your identity each time you wish to access or update your site. The cookie enables you to go from screen to screen without being repeatedly asked to authenticate your identity. This cookie will not be used to track your individual movements through QuickBooks.com.

Third party tracking systems in use on behalf of this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with certain links on our site to help us better understand and improve our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies and will have full access to site functionality. These cookies do not follow you once you leave our site, nor are they linked to personal information you provide elsewhere on our site. If you have any questions about our third party tracking system, please contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/privacy.asp?topic=privacy&).

If you are a registered user on the Support area of our Web site, you will receive a cookie when you login. This cookie is maintained by your browser and contains your identifier. This cookie is used to authenticate your identity and provide you with access to areas of our Web site that are limited to registered users, such as the technical support section for Premier Service Plan members.

Advertising networks that serve ads on this Web site may assign different cookies to you. Those cookies may be used to track your involvement with the advertising on our site. You may choose not to accept these cookies. Intuit does not control those parties. You should review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use private information. If you have questions about our ad serving networks, please contact us at [privacy@intuit.com](https://orderupdate.intuit.com/privacy.asp?topic=privacy&).

  * Web Site Usage Data. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from, your IP address or domain name, the date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any) and other parameters in the URL. We use this data to better understand Web site usage in the aggregate so that we know what areas of our Web site users prefer. This information is stored in log files and is used for aggregated and statistical reporting. This log information is not linked to personally identifiable information gathered elsewhere on the site.
  * Co-branded and Third-Party Sites. Our co-branded sites are clearly identified by both an Intuit and a partner's logo. The QuickBooks Web site may provide links to third-party Web sites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. On these sites either Intuit and/or its partners may collect information about you. Intuit is not responsible for the actions of these third parties. We encourage you to review their privacy policies to learn more about what, why and how they collect and use personally identifiable information. 



In some cases, we will employ or work with consultants, temporary workers, third party software developers, or outsourcers to complete a business process or provide a service, for example delivering products, offering online software applications, or sending e-mails on our behalf. When we employ these agents or offer their services to our customers, we may need to share your personally identifiable information. These agents cannot use your personally identifiable information for purposes other than to offer or complete the service we are outsourcing.

If we plan to make significant changes to any of our privacy policies or practices with respect to how we use personally identifiable information, we'll post those changes to this privacy statement 30 days before they take effect.

In some cases we may be required to disclose certain information to comply with a legal process, such as a court order, subpoena or search warrant.
