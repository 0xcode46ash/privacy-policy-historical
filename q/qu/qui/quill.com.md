#### Types of personal information we collect

  
Back to top 

We collect and store personal information that you give us when you register on our Web site, complete an application, request a catalog, place an order, enroll in a promotional or rewards program, submit for a rebate, call us, or send us a letter or e-mail. This information may include your name, mailing address, e-mail address, telephone number, fax number, credit card number and expiration date, and other optional demographic information. If you respond to a sweepstakes or contest, we will ask you to verify that you are old enough to participate.

  


#### How we use and share personal information 

  
Back to top  

We use the personal information we collect to process your orders, identify you within our systems, contact you if we have questions about your order, notify you about new services or special promotional programs, and submit for rebates. Quill and the sponsoring manufacturer will have access to any rebate information you provide.

We share your personal information within the Quill family of businesses and with third parties that perform services for us or on our behalf (for example, credit card companies, financial institutions, shipping companies, printing houses, consultants and advisors, and rebate processors) and when, in our judgment, we believe it is necessary or appropriate to prevent fraud, injury, or harm to persons or property, to protect our rights or the rights of others, to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or as otherwise required by law. We limit the scope of the information provided to third parties, and we allow its use only for the purposes for which it was disclosed. Personal information may be transferred in connection with a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition, insolvency, or asset sale involving any Quill business or asset to which the information pertains. If you shop through our catalog, or via Quill.com®, we may share your name and mailing address (but not your e-mail address or telephone number) for external direct mail campaigns conducted by companies or organizations which offer products or services we believe may be of interest to you. 

  


#### Special information for Quill.com® shoppers

  
Back to top 

If you shop with us online, we use third-party advertising technology to help us improve our marketing efforts. This technology uses non-personally identifiable information about your visits to Quill.com® and the sites upon which we advertise. We use Coremetrics, a service provider, to assist us with data collection and reporting. As part of that process, a “cookie” may be placed on your computer. Cookies are small data files that are stored on your computer’s hard drive. Coremetrics does not have the right to use the information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us. For more information, including how to opt out, go to [www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html](http://www.coremetrics.com/info_eluminate2.html).

We generally do not seek to collect personal information through our Web site from children under age 13. If we conduct an online program that is open to children, personally identifiable information from children under age 13 will be collected and used only with the consent of the child’s parent or guardian, or the child will be able to participate without providing personally identifiable information.

For your convenience, our Web site may contain links to the sites of affiliates, manufacturers, and other companies. Please keep in mind that these sites are not under our control and we are not responsible for the privacy practices of the companies that run them. If you shop on one of these sites, we encourage you to locate and familiarize yourself with the applicable privacy policy.
