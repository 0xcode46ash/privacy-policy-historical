Last modified: November 22, 2015

Thank you for visiting the QuizzClub website located at quizzclub.com (the "Website", "we", "us"). At QuizzClub, the privacy of our visitors is of extreme importance to us. This privacy policy document outlines the types of personal information is received and collected by QuizzClub and how it is used. 

If you require any more information or have any questions about our privacy policy, please feel free to contact us by email (contact at quizzclub.com). 

## What information do we collect?

We collect information from you when you subscribe to our newsletter. When registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter your: e-mail address and name. You may, however, visit our site anonymously. 

## How We Use Your Information 

We generally use your information only to operate the Site and make your experience more efficient, effective and enjoyable. 

Most uses we make of your information are for site administration of your use of the site, such as diagnosing problems, identification and security. We may also use this information to contact you for operational purposes. 

Player user names are displayed all over the site to identify players. Players should not use personally identifying information in their user names. 

We use player email addresses to contact a player if a password is forgotten, send questions and tests daily when specifically requested by the player. We also request that a user provide their email address in our feedback section, so that we can respond to their problem. 

We use player IP addresses to help track down cheating, and to provide us a way to prevent players from accessing the website for abuse, spam, illegal activities, account infractions, etc. Finally, we display in the email the IP address of the player who sends an email from a form on our website to external email addresses, to prevent/track spammers. For example, if someone abuses our "I have forgotten my password" form to send unwanted emails to another user, we can use that IP information to determine where the abuse is originating from. 

Whenever you play our Quizzes, we collect data about your interactions with each Quiz. This information may be associated with your user name, IP address or device ID for the purpose of providing our Services and improving them. In addition, when you play a Quiz, your user name, related photo and Quiz score may be displayed in our "Top Scores" for other players to see. If you do not want your user name and related photo displayed in the Top Scores, please refrain from playing our Quizzes. 

Player city, state, and country is public and appears in user profiles. It is used to display regional scoreboards and statistics for some of our trivia games. Players are free to leave this information blank. 

We also collect and store http logs, statistics, usage logs, and other information about the online activities of our visitors, primarily for error and abuse tracing. This information is never offered to 3rd parties, unless required by law. 

If you log-in to our Services using a social media (such as Facebook or Twitter) log-in, you are granting permission to the social media service to share your user details with us. This may include your name, email address, date of birth and location, which will then be used to create a QuizzClub identity. These social media services may use information about your visit to our Services on their pages. If you browse these pages while still logged in to your account with us, information they collect may be connected to your account on their Web site.

## How do we protect your information?

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information. 

## Do we disclose any information to outside parties?

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses. 

If QuizzClub is acquired or becomes part of another organization, we retain the right to transfer all exclusive control over that data to our new operating entity. 

We sometimes share aggregated data with some of our partners. However, none of this information identifies you in any way without your consent. For example, we may share data that shows that a certain percentage of our users buy a certain product, but there would be no identification of specific users. 

There are circumstances where we may need to provide individual information to others. For example, we may disclose information if we in good faith believe it is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who is violating our Conditions of Use of the Site, breaking the law, causing injury to or interference with others or otherwise violating the rights of others. We may also disclose information to the extent we believe in good faith it is required by law or for administrative and other purposes we deem necessary to maintain, service and improve our products and service. In all such circumstances, we will limit what information we disclose to the extent we believe it to be appropriate
