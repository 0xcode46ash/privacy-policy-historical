The Non-Personal Data we collect includes without limitation Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, domain names of your Internet Service Provider, your approximate geographic location, a record of the Site pages that you visit, the time of your visits and aggregated Personal Data that cannot be used to specifically identify you. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies is strictly for statistical purposes and cannot, in and of itself, be used to specifically identify you. 

Cookies: In operating the Site, we use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyse Site usage more accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your browser that allows you to access the Site without needing to remember and then enter a password more than once during a visit to the Site. These cookies may be used to tailor content you see on the Site as well as other sites that you may visit in the future. Through your web browser's option settings you may be able (i) to receive notifications when you are receiving new cookies, (ii) to disable cookies or (iii) to delete cookies. Please refer to your web browser's help section for information on how to do this.

Google Analytics: This cookie allows us to see information on user website activities including, but not limited to page views, source and time spent on website. The information is depersonalised and is displayed as numbers, meaning it cannot be tracked back to individuals. This will help to protect your privacy. Using Google Analytics we can see what content is popular on our website, and strive to give you more of the things you enjoy reading. 

DoubleClick: We use remarketing codes to log when users view specific pages, allowing us to provide targeted advertising in the future when you visit other websites which display Google Ads. 

Aggregated Personal Data: In an on-going effort to better understand and serve the users of the Site and Quicket Services, Quicket often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behaviour based on Personal Data and other information that we have collected. This research may be compiled and analysed on an aggregate basis and this aggregate information is strictly for statistical purposes and does not identify you personally and therefore is considered and treated as Non-Personal Data under this Privacy Policy.
