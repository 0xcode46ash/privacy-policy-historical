Should you have any questions about this policy or our practices, please send an email to [Privacy@QuestDiagnostics.com](mailto:Privacy@QuestDiagnostics.com) or write to us at:

**What Personal Information We Collect**

Quest Diagnostics collects your personal information online when you voluntarily provide it to us. If you choose to register online, we ask you to provide limited personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number and/or email address. We also collect information that will allow you to establish a username and password if you would like to do that.

How to Review and Change Your Personal Information

If you register for a Quest Diagnostics account, you may review and change your personal information by logging in to [MyQuest](https://myquest.questdiagnostics.com/web/home)™ by Care360®, then clicking on your name at the top of the screen and then clicking on “Manage Profile”, or by logging into [Billing](https://secure.questdiagnostics.com/PatientBilling/PatientBillingDef.action?fromLink=doPayment) and then clicking on “Manage My Account” and then “My Profile,” or by logging in while [making an Appointment](https://secure.questdiagnostics.com/hcp/psc/jsp/SearchLocation.do), then clicking on the “Cancel/Change/Confirm” link and then “Manage my Account”.

**How We Use Personal Information That We Collect Online**

Internal Uses

We may use your personal information within Quest Diagnostics: (1) to provide you with the services and products you request; (2) to answer questions about our services; billing, payment methods or use of our website; (3) to process or collect payments for our services, (4) to conduct customer surveys; and (5) to contact you about the products and services that we offer.

**Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties**

We will not disclose any personal information to any third party (excluding our contractors to whom we may provide such information for the limited purpose of providing services to us and who are obligated to keep the information confidential), unless (1) you have authorized us to do so; (2) we are legally required to do so, for example, in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process and/or, (3) it is necessary to protect our property rights related to this website. We also may share aggregate, non-personal information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information about our users.

**Cookie Placement**

Certain Quest Diagnostics websites, like many other commercial sites, may use a standard technology called “cookies” to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set. We may use cookies to keep track of information about your current web browsing session which will be discarded as soon as you log out or close your web browser. This information also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose. We may also make use of “persistent or memory based” cookies, which remain on your computer’s hard drive until you delete them. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize our services if you reject cookies.

**How We Protect Information Online**

We exercise great care to protect your personal information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email since we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the security features that are built into our websites.

In addition, we limit Quest Diagnostics’ employees and contractors’ access to personal information. Only those employees and contractors with a business reason to know have access to this information. We educate our employees about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of customer information.

We review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.

**How can you help protect your information?**

If you are using a Quest Diagnostics website for which you registered and choose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of the Quest Diagnostics website and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.

**Links to Other Sites**

We want to provide site visitors valuable information, services and products. Featured programs and other site content within the Quest Diagnostics site may link our users to third party sites. Quest Diagnostics does not control and is not responsible for practices of any third-party websites.

**Note**

From time to time, we may change this privacy statement. For example, as we update and improve our services, new features may require modifications to the privacy statement. Accordingly, please check back periodically.

THIS NOTICE DESCRIBES HOW MEDICAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU MAY BE USED AND DISCLOSED AND HOW YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION. PLEASE REVIEW IT CAREFULLY.

Quest Diagnostics and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Quest Diagnostics”) are committed to protecting the privacy of your identifiable health information. This information is known as “protected health information” or “PHI.” PHI includes laboratory test orders and test results as well as invoices for the healthcare services we provide.

**Our Responsibilities**

Quest Diagnostics is required by law to maintain the privacy of your PHI. We are also required to provide you with this Notice of our legal duties and privacy practices upon request. It describes our legal duties, privacy practices and your patient rights as determined by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. We are required to follow the terms of this Notice currently in effect. We are required to notify affected individuals in the event of a breach involving unsecured protected health information. PHI is stored electronically and is subject to electronic disclosure. This Notice does not apply to non-diagnostic services that we perform such as certain drugs of abuse testing services.

**How We May Use or Disclose Your Health Information**

We use your PHI for treatment, payment, or healthcare operations purposes and for other purposes permitted or required by law. Not every use or disclosure is listed in this Notice, but all of our uses or disclosures of your health information will fall into one of the categories listed below.

We need your written authorization to use or disclose your health information for any purpose not covered by one of the categories below. Subject to compliance with limited exceptions, we will not use or disclose psychotherapy notes, use or disclose your PHI for marketing purposes or sell your PHI, unless you have signed an authorization. You may revoke any authorization you sign at any time. If you revoke your authorization, we will no longer use or disclose your health information for the reasons stated in your authorization except to the extent we have already taken action based on your authorization.

The law permits us to use and disclose your health information for the following purposes:

Treatment  
Quest Diagnostics provides laboratory testing for physicians and other healthcare professionals, and we use your information in our testing process. We disclose your health information to authorized healthcare professionals who order tests or need access to your test results for treatment purposes. Examples of other treatment related purposes include disclosure to a pathologist to help interpret your test results or use of your information to contact you to obtain another specimen, if necessary.

Payment  
Quest Diagnostics will use and disclose your PHI for purposes of billing and payment. For example, we may disclose your PHI to health plans or other payers to determine whether you are enrolled with the payer or eligible for health benefits or to obtain payment for our services. If you are insured under another person’s health insurance policy (for example, parent, spouse, domestic partner or a former spouse), we may also send invoices to the subscriber whose policy covers your health services.

Healthcare Operations  
Quest Diagnostics may use and disclose your PHI for activities necessary to support our healthcare operations, such as performing quality checks on our testing, internal audits, arranging for legal services or developing reference ranges for our tests.

Business Associates  
We may provide your PHI to other companies or individuals that need the information to provide services to us. These other entities, known as “business associates,” are required to maintain the privacy and security of PHI. For example, we may provide information to companies that assist us with billing of our services. We may also use an outside collection agency to obtain payment when necessary.

As Required by Law  
We may use and disclose your PHI as required by law.

Law Enforcement Activities and Legal Proceedings  
We may use and disclose your PHI if necessary, to prevent or lessen a serious threat to your health and safety or that of another person. We may also provide PHI to law enforcement officials, for example, in response to a warrant, investigative demand or similar legal process, or for officials to identify or locate a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or missing person. We may also disclose PHI to appropriate agencies if we reasonably believe an individual to be a victim of abuse, neglect or domestic violence.

We may disclose your PHI as required to comply with a court or administrative order. We may disclose your PHI in response to a subpoena, discovery request or other legal process in the course of a judicial or administrative proceeding, but only if efforts have been made to tell you about the request or to obtain an order of protection for the requested information.

Research  
We may disclose PHI for research purposes when an Institutional Review Board or privacy board has reviewed the research proposal and established protocols to ensure the privacy of your PHI and determined that the researcher does not need to obtain your authorization prior to using your PHI for research purposes. We may also disclose information about decedents to researchers under certain circumstances.

Other Uses and Disclosures  
As permitted by HIPAA, we may disclose your PHI to:

  * Public Health Authorities
  * The Food and Drug Administration
  * Health Oversight Agencies
  * Military Command Authorities
  * National Security and Intelligence Organizations
  * Correctional Institutions
  * Organ and Tissue Donation Organizations
  * Coroners, Medical Examiners and Funeral Directors
  * Workers Compensation Agents



We may also disclose relevant PHI to a family member, friend, or anyone else you designate in order for that person to be involved in your care or payment related to your care. We may also disclose PHI to those assisting in disaster relief efforts so that others can be notified about your condition, status and location.

Note Regarding State Law  
For all of the above purposes, when state law is more restrictive than federal law, we are required to follow the more restrictive state law.
