# Question.com

  
The following policy outlines the types of information that we gather about you and the way that way we use and don't use this information.

The information that we collect about our visitors falls into three general categories: 

1\. _Information You Provide to Us_. We may collect and store information, personal or otherwise, that you voluntarily supply to us either on the Question.com site, via e-mail, or in any other way. Some examples of this type of information include the information you submit (such as your name or e-mail address) when you register for surveys, sweepstakes or contests, information that you post on message boards, and information contained in search requests or questions you submit to the site. If you decline to supply or provide us with certain information, we may not be able to provide you with some services that are dependent on the collection of this information. 

2\. _Information that is Automatically Collected._ We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate through the Question.com site. For example, to enhance your experience at Question.com, we use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie." Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use our site, cookies help us track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of our site where you have entered preference information before. Another example of information that we automatically collect as you navigate our site is information about your computer's connection to the Internet. This information allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on our site. 

3\. _Information from Other Sources_. Question.com may also obtain information about you from third parties or other sources and may combine the information that we receive from them with information we have already obtained about you. 

Question.com includes links to other websites, and provides access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another website or purchase products or services or conduct other transactions through the Service, use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.   


Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In the unlikely event that Question.com, the bulk of our assets, or our site is acquired by another company, information on our visitors would be among the transferred assets.
