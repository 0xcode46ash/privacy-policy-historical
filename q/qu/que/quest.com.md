# Quest Software Privacy Statement

We at Quest Software recognize the importance of protecting your personal information and we are committed to safeguarding your privacy online.

Because Quest Software respects its customers and understands that they are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that you know what kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared.

As we continue to develop our Web site and take advantage of technologies to improve the service we provide, this policy may change. We therefore encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy policy.

**Collection of Personal Information**  
When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, or entering contests, Quest Software may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form.

If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Quest Software may require that you provide us personal information, such as your name, mailing address, e-mail address, and other personal identifying information. When ordering products on the site, you may be asked to provide a credit card number.

When you submit personal information to Quest Software, you understand and agree that Quest Software and its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which Quest Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. In certain instances, the personal information you submit will remain confidential to Quest Software. These instances will be specifically noted at time of submission.

Quest Software collects this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Quest Software also uses information that you provide as part of our effort to keep you informed about product upgrades, special offers, and other Quest Software products and services.

If you do not want the information you provide to Quest Software to be used to inform you of other products and special offers from Quest Software, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to Quest Software, Quest Software will honor your preference. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We do, however, share selected information under certain conditions: Quest Software may selectively provide certain information to other companies or organizations that have products or services we think may interest you. If you do not want the information you provide to Quest Software to be shared with other companies, and you indicate this preference when you provide the information to Quest Software, Quest Software will honor your preference.
