Queerty Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy is pretty simple. We respect yours, especially because without it, we wouldn’t be in business. Listen up.

When visitors come to a Queerty, Inc. site, we collect standard information such as their IP addresses and referral data. We also collect information visitors voluntarily submit to us, such as their names, email addresses, mailing addresses, phone numbers, interests and preferences about our services, and other personal data. Generally this information is collected when visitors sign up for a user account, comment on our sites, initiative communication with Queerty, Inc, or enter a contest or promotion; none are required to visit or use a Queerty, Inc site.

We do not rent or sell your personal information. There are no “select third-party marketers” we give your information to without your expressed consent.

We do place cookies on your computer. Our cookies come may from our publishing system and our advertisers. Cookies help store your name or email address when commenting or logging in to a Queerty, Inc. site. Our advertisers and our ad serving technology may place cookies placed on your computer for tracking purposes.

We allow third-party companies to serve ads and collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you. These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information.  Look for the AdChoices logo on certain ads and click it to opt-out of these practices.

We do collect standard usage and tracking data, including IP addresses, page visits and session activity.  We collect it on aggregate and sometimes make that aggregate information available to advertisers.

Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.
