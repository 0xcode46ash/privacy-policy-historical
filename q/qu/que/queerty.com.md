Privacy Policy

Our privacy policy is pretty simple. We respect yours, especially because without it, we wouldn't be in business. Listen up.

We do not rent or sell your personal information, such as your name, email address, phone number, mailing address, or any other identifiable information. We do not even collect such data without your initiation, such as you emailing Jossip, commenting on an item, or signing up to an email list.

We _do_ place cookies on your computer. You know about cookies, those little data files private investigators love finding while snooping around your computer to see if you're downloading porn or cheating on your spouse. Our cookies come may from our publishing system and our advertisers. The cookies from our end are there simply to remember your name or email address if you post a comment to a story or engage in similar activity with Jossip. The cookies placed on your computer from our advertisers cannot be controlled by Jossip, nor do we monitor that data, but we're pretty sure they're only collecting the same data we do, unless you give them permission to do otherwise.

We do collect standard usage and tracking data, including IP addresses, page visits and session activity. This data, however, is not collected in a manner that can uniquely identify you. We collect it on aggregate and sometimes make that aggregate information available to advertisers.

We take your privacy very seriously. If you have any concerns, please write us at [publisher@jossip.com](mailto:publisher@jossip.com).
