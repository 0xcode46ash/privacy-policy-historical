# Questrade Privacy Policy | Personal Information Policy Details

The Questrade, Inc. ("Questrade") privacy policy applies to all current or former Questrade brokerage clients or anyone who registers for one of our services or promotional offers. Throughout the policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you or your accounts as personal information.

Personal information policy details:  
We do not sell your personal information to anyone.

The law allows you to opt out of only certain kinds of information sharing with third parties. Questrade does not share personal information about you with any third parties that triggers this opt out right. This means YOU ARE ALREADY OPTED OUT. Questrade only shares personal information with third parties in the following limited circumstances:

  * We disclose personal information to companies that help us process or service your transactions or account(s), including companies that clear and process your transactions and print and mail your account statements.
  * Sometimes we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing your account. Our contracts with such third parties prohibits them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and the third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we have provided to them.
  * We may also enter into what is called a joint marketing relationship with another financial institution, if we believe that you might be interested in hearing about its products and services. If we enter into such a relationship, we will notify you about it and have contracts in place to ensure that the other financial institution will protect confidentiality of the limited information we would share with it (e.g., name and address), and that it will use your personal information only for the joint marketing arrangement.
  * We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, resolve client disputes, perform credit/authentication checks, or for institutional risk control.
  * For regulatory purposes, self-regulatory organizations including Market Regulation Services Inc., the Investment Dealers Association of Canada, and the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (collectively, "SROs") require access to personal information of current and former clients, employees, agents, directors, officers, partners and others that has been collected or used by regulated persons.

    * Surveillance of trading-related activity, sales, financial compliance, trade desk review and other regulatory audits;
    * Investigation of potential regulatory and statutory violations;
    * Regulatory databases;
    * Enforcement or disciplinary proceedings;
    * Reporting to securities regulators;
