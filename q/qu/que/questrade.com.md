# QUESTRADE - Privacy Pledge

  | 

At Questrade, your privacy is our priority. Our most important asset is our relationship with you. We understand that you have entrusted us with your private financial information, and we do everything we can to maintain that trust. 

At Questrade… 

• We do not sell your personal information to anyone   
• You are automatically opted out from sharing personal information with third parties   
• We are committed to safeguarding your personal and financial information 

Details of our approach to privacy and how your personal information is collected and used are set forth in the Questrade Privacy Policy below. 

**The Questrade Privacy Policy**

The Questrade, Inc. ("Questrade") privacy policy applies to consumers who are current or former Questrade brokerage clients or who register for one of our services or promotional offers.   
Throughout the policy, we refer to information that personally identifies you or your accounts as "personal information." 

**1\. We do not sell your personal information to anyone.

2\. The law allows you to "opt out" of only certain kinds of information sharing with third parties. Questrade  
    does not share personal information about you with any third parties that triggers this opt out right. This  
    means YOU ARE ALREADY OPTED OUT. Questrade only shares personal information with third parties in   
    the following limited circumstances:

**

>  **•** We disclose personal information to companies that help us process or service your transactions or account(s), including companies that clear and process your transactions and print and mail your account statements. 
> 
> **•** Sometimes we enter into contracts with third parties so that they can assist us in servicing your account. The contracts prohibit them from using any of your personal information for their own purposes, and the third parties are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information we have provided to them. 
> 
> **•** We may also enter into what is called a "joint marketing relationship" with another financial institution, if we believe that you might be interested in hearing about its products or services. If we do, we have contracts in place to ensure that the other financial institution will protect the confidentiality of the limited information we would share with it (e.g., name and address), and that it will use your information only for the joint marketing arrangement. 
> 
> **•** We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required or permitted under law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, resolve consumer disputes, perform credit/authentication checks, or for institutional risk control.
> 
> **•** For regulatory purposes, self regulatory organizations including Market Regulation Services Inc., the Investment Dealers Association of Canada, and the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (collectively, " **SROs** ") require access to personal information of current and former clients, employees, agents, directors, officers, partners and others that has been collected or used by Regulated Persons. SROs collect, use or disclose such personal information obtained from Regulated Persons for regulatory purposes, including:  
>      • Surveillance of trading-related activity,  
>      • Sales, financial compliance, trade desk review and other regulatory audits,  
>      • Investigation of potential regulatory and statutory violations,  
>      • Regulatory databases,  
>      • Enforcement or disciplinary proceedings,  
>      • Reporting to securities regulators, and  
>      • Information-sharing with securities regulatory authorities, regulated marketplaces, other self-regulatory  
>        organizations and law enforcement agencies in any jurisdiction in connection with any of the foregoing. 

**3\. We collect personal information in the normal course of business in order to administer your accounts  
    and serve you better. **

> **•** Application and registration information. We collect information that you provide to us when you open an account or register for one of our services, or when you accept a promotional offer for a Questrade-sponsored product or service. The information we collect may include name, address, phone number, email address, social security number, and information about your interests, investments, and investment experience. We also may collect information from consumer reporting agencies to verify your identity in the account opening process. 
> 
> **•** Web Site usage. We collect some information from our web sites through the use of "cookies." For example we may identify the pages on our web sites that your browser requests or visits. This information is only personally identifiable if you have chosen to identify yourself, for example, by opening an account. 
> 
> **•** Transaction information. Once you have an account with us, to administer your account and better serve you, we collect and maintain personal information about your transactions, including balances, positions, and history, and may include your name or other data in an internal client list that reflects your activities at Questrade. 
> 
> **•** As part of our efforts to reach and serve new and existing clients we sometimes collect and use information from outside mailing lists.

**4\. We use your personal information to help us deliver the best possible service to you.**

> **•** To understand your financial needs and to deliver financial products and services that meet them, we may share personal information, such as transaction or experience data, with various service providers, all of which follow similar privacy policies.

**5\. We protect the confidentiality and security of your personal information.**

> **•** Companies we hire to provide support services are not allowed to use your personal information for their own purposes and are contractually obligated to maintain strict confidentiality. We limit their use of your personal information to the performance of the specific service we have requested. 
> 
> **•** We restrict access to personal information to our employees and agents for business purposes only. All employees are trained and required to safeguard such information. 
> 
> **•** We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to guard your personal information.

**6\. We continue to evaluate our efforts to protect personal information and make every effort to keep your  
    personal information accurate and up to date. **

> **•** If you identify any inaccuracy in your personal information, or you need to make a change to that information, please contact us so that we may promptly update our records.

**7\. We will provide notice of changes in our information-sharing practices.**

> **•** If, at any time in the future, it is necessary to disclose any of your personal information in a way that is inconsistent with this policy, we will give you advance notice of the proposed change so that you will have the opportunity to opt-out of such disclosure.
