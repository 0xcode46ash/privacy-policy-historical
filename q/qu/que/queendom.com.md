# Queendom's Privacy Policy

|  |  |  | 

** At Queendom.com, your privacy and peace of mind is our top priority. **  
  
---  
  
Collection of personally identifiable data

> Queendom.com does not collect personally identifiable information from any of our visitors without prior consent. 
> 
> For My Profile members, the results of each test they take are automatically saved in their My Profile account. This information is secure and protected by a password and login name. Users should keep passwords carefully guarded as they would any other personal information. My Profile takes all necessary precautions to protect this information from third parties, and does not provide any third party access to these results. Users may choose to give therapists or counselors access to their account, but these parties cannot alter the data. My Profile does occasionally use test results for statistical purposes, but only in an aggregated and anonymous form. 
> 
> When visitors submit stories to the Fine Kettle of Fish or questions to Chaise Longue, they may be sharing very personal information. They are, however, given the option of excluding their name, e-mail, age, and place of residence. All information that is voluntarily submitted may be posted in these sections. 
> 
> In the SeX-Files Surveys, personal information is collected, but anonymously. We do not ask for e-mail addresses or names of our participants. Queendom.com does collect and analyze the data from our surveys, but on an aggregated (collective) basis. Each time that we collect individual data from our visitors that may be posted on the site (as in the comments for the SeX-Files Survey), we clearly announce this possibility. Of course, all comments posted are anonymous. 
> 
> On the Discussion Boards, visitors have to register in order to be able to post messages. Registration is required because we occasionally have problems with spammers and individuals who choose to verbally harass other members of the community. We closely monitor the discussion boards because we want Queendom to be a safe place where people can share and be honest about their problems. We promptly remove any inappropriate messages and ban the offender. The e-mail addresses are not visible to other users, and are not used in any way by Queendom. We encourage users to get a web-based e-mail account that they use for communication with strangers. Such an account can be obtained free of charge from HotMail or Yahoo.   
  
  
Collection of test data for validation studies

> We often gather data for further validatation of our tests. Visitor have the choice of allowing or not the use of their information for validation purposes. When conducting validation studies, we always use aggregated (collective) data, never individual identifiable information (name, place of residence, etc.). 
> 
> Unless otherwise specified, no records of scored tests and quizzes are kept.
