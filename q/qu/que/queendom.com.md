** At QueenDom.com, your privacy and peace of mind is our priority. **  
  
---  
|  **Collection of personally identifiable data**  
---  
  
QueenDom.com does not collect personally identifiable information from any of our visitors without prior consent. 

When visitors submit stories to the Fine Kettle of Fish or questions to Chaise Longue, they may be divulging very personal information. However, they have the option of including their name, e-mail, age, and place of residence. All information that is voluntarily submitted may be posted in these sections. 

In the SeX-Files Surveys, personal information is collected, but anonymously. We do not ask for e-mail addresses or names of our participants. QueenDom.com does collect and analyze the data from our surveys, but on an aggregated (collective) basis. Each time that we collect individual data from our visitors that may be posted on the site (as in the comments for the SeX-Files Survey), we plainly announce this possibility. Of course, all comments posted are anonymous. 

On the Discussion Boards, visitors have to register in order to be able to post messages. Registration is required because we occasionally have problems with spammers and individuals who choose to verbally harass other members of the community. We closely monitor the discussion boards because we want QueenDom to be a safe place where people can share and be honest about their problems. We promptly remove any inappropriate messages and ban the offender. The e-mail addresses are not visible to other users, and are not used by Queendom. We encourage users to get a web-based e-mail account that they use for communication with strangers. Such an account [can be obtained free of charge from Queendom.com](http://www.queendom.com/email/).   
  
|  **Validation of Tests**  
---  
  
Occasionally we gather data in order to further validate our tests. Each visitor has the choice of submitting his/her information for validation purposes. Even in this instance, QueenDom.com never uses individual data (name, place of residence, etc.), but uses aggregated (collective) databases for purposes of test validation. 

Otherwise, no records of scored tests and quizzes are kept.   
  
|  **E-Mail**  
---  
  
The only lists of e-mails kept by QueenDom.com are those in the mailing lists (QueenDom's main mailing list and the WebPsych Club newsletter), to which visitors voluntarily subscribe. We never ask for your name, place of residence, age, gender, etc. We only require your e-mail address. Anyone can request, at any time, to be removed from the mailing list. Mailing lists are not sold, nor are they made available to anyone. 

When subscribing to Queendom's web-based e-mail, visitors are asked to submit personally identifiable information. Any information submitted is kept strictly confidential and is stored on secure servers operated by our partner company Tek21/Chek. We appreciate honesty, but anybody who is reluctant to provide such information should type "Queendom" (or an alias of their choice) in all required fields that they want to keep private (ex. name or ZIP code). All fields that are not labeled as _Required_ can be left empty. 

Visitors have the option of including an e-mail address when submitting a story or question to the Fine Kettle of Fish or Chaise Longue. These e-mail addresses are not sold or stored in mailing lists, but they are visible to any visitors to QueenDom.com. 

For the QuizCards, we do not capture the e-mail addresses of senders or receivers. 

QueenDom.com never sends unsolicited e-mail, nor do we send any spam.
