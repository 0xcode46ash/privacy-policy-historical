**What Personal Information We Collect  
**  
Quest Diagnostics collects your personal information online when you voluntarily provide it to us. If you choose to register online, we ask you to provide limited personal information, such as your name, address, telephone number and/or email address. We also collect information that will allow you to establish a username and password if you would like to do that. 

**How We Use Personal Information That We Collect Online**

Privacy Choices

When you register online for one of our services, you must provide your consent before we will contact you by mail or email about our services.  For example, you will need to consent to receive an appointment reminder.  You may change your preferences within your registration profile at any time. 

Internal Uses **  
**  
We may use your personal information within Quest Diagnostics: (1) to provide you with the services and products you request; (2) to answer questions about our services; billing, payment methods or use of our website; (3) to process or collect payments for our services and, (4) to conduct customer surveys. 

Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties

We will not disclose any personal information to any third party, unless (1) you have authorized us to do so; (2) we are legally required to do so, for example, in response to a subpoena, court order or other legal process and/or, (3) it is necessary to protect our property rights related to this website. We also may share aggregate, non-personal information about website usage with unaffiliated third parties. This aggregate information does not contain any personal information about our users. 

**Cookie Placement**

Certain Quest Diagnostics websites, like many other commercial sites, may use a standard technology called "cookies" to collect information about how our site is used. Cookies were designed to help a website operator determine that a particular user had visited the site previously and thus save and remember any preferences that may have been set. We may use cookies to keep track of information about your current web browsing session which will be discarded as soon as you log out or close your web browser. This information also allows us to statistically monitor how many people are using our site and for what purpose. We may also make use of “persistent or memory based” cookies, which remain on your computer’s hard drive until you delete them. Although you have the ability to modify your browser to either accept all cookies, notify you when a cookie is sent, or reject all cookies, it may not be possible to utilize our services if you reject cookies.

**How We Protect Information Online  
**  
We exercise great care to protect your personal information. This includes, among other things, using industry standard techniques such as firewalls, encryption, and intrusion detection.   As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from us. This is especially true for information you transmit to us via email since we have no way of protecting that information until it reaches us since email does not have the security features that are built into our websites. 

In addition, we limit Quest Diagnostics' employees and contractors' access to personal information. Only those employees and contractors with a business reason to know have access to this information. We educate our employees about the importance of maintaining confidentiality of customer information. 

We review our security arrangements from time to time as we deem appropriate.

**How can you help protect your information?  
**  
If you are using a Quest Diagnostics website for which you registered and choose a password, we recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Also remember to sign out of the Quest Diagnostics website and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if others have access to your computer.

**Links to Other Sites**

We want to provide site visitors valuable information, services and products. Featured programs and other site content within the Quest Diagnostics site may link our users to third party sites. Quest Diagnostics does not control and is not responsible for practices of any third-party websites. 

**Note**

From time to time, we may change this privacy statement. For example, as we update and improve our services, new features may require modifications to the privacy statement. Accordingly, please check back periodically.
