### External links

Linked sites are not under the control of QCA, nor are we responsible for the content or reliability of any linked external internet sites. These links are provided simply as a service - it should not be implied, specifically, that we recommend, endorse or approve of any of the content at the linked sites (likewise, not linking to a particular site does not imply lack of recommendation, endorsement or approval). This aim of this section of our website is to provide a manageable selection of links to further reading and research for those interested in the work of QCA. This list, therefore, does not seek to be an exhaustive list of websites, which might be of interest. Consequently, we acknowledge that it may not list some sites that are relevant to the work of QCA.
