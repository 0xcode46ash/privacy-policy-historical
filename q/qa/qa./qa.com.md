# Privacy policy - Website legal notices - QA

## QA takes the issue of security and data protection very seriously and strictly adheres to guidelines published in the United Kingdom Data Protection Act of 1998.

QA is an ISO27001:2013 accredited company, and takes the management of data and asset protection very seriously.

QA Group and its  companies  ("QA", "we", "our" or "us") are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. This Privacy Policy describes how we use the personal information that we collect from you, or that you provide, when you:

  * visit any of our websites or portals (the "Website");
  * use the educational courses, testing, certification and products, and consultancy services (together the "Services") that we provide;
  * or otherwise contact us.



**Information We Collect**

We collect personal information from you through the use of forms, which may be on paper or on our Websites, such as when you login to access our Services, signup to receive our newsletters, register for information, or make a purchase or commence a course of study.

When you create an account on our Websites you have the opportunity to provide us with information about any special requirements, such as dietary requirements, that you may have.

If you are progressing your career through a QA Apprenticeship or further/higher education, we may need to collect addition personal information to secure funding or satisfy statutory legal or Government scheme requirements.

We also collect personal information from you when you communicate with us for any reason, including by email, postal mail or telephone, and when you use our Services.

In addition, we collect certain information automatically about visitors to our Websites as described in section 3 below.

We may record and store the telephone conversations you have to any of our offices for the purposes of quality control, staff training, and/or to prevent or detect crime.

If you choose to provide us with information you explicitly grant your consent to us using that information as is necessary to provide Services to you.

##### Special information for apprentices

If you are progressing your career through a QA Apprenticeship or further/higher education, we may need to collect addition personal information to secure funding or satisfy statutory legal or Government scheme requirements.

Some of the information you supply will be used by the Skills Funding Agency to fulfil its statutory functions, issue/verify your Unique Learner Number (ULN) and update/check your Personal Learning Record. The Skills Funding Agency may share your ULN and Personal Learning Record with other education related organisations, such as your careers service, school, college, university, Government Departments and public bodies responsible for funding your education. 

Further details of how your information is processed and shared can be found at:

**Use of Cookies**

QA websites uses cookies to provide easier navigation around the sites and gather anonymous analytics information. In some cases, cookies are used to provide functionality within sessions, such as within the myQA portal.

We use Google analytics within our websites to monitor how visitors move around the website and how they reached it. This is done so that we can see total (not individual) statistics on which types of content users access most frequently. The Google cookies also tell us if you have visited the site before and allow us to track how many individual users the websites have. The Google cookies cannot be used to identify individuals - they are only used for statistical purposes only. You can opt out of Google cookies here <https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout> 

From time to time we may have links to other services such as Social media or video services on our sites. These services may drop cookies on your computer when you use them, especially if you are already logged into their service. Due to the nature of how cookies work, QA cannot access these cookies nor control their use. Likewise, these 3rd party services cannot access QA's session or analytics cookies. 

You have the right to choose whether or not to accept cookies and to set your own cookie preferences on your computer.

These preferences can be to accept all cookies, to notify you when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at all. However, by opting not to receive cookies at any time, certain features of the Website cannot be provided and you may not be able to enjoy the Website to its fullest. All web browsers are different and to learn how to change your cookie preferences, check the "Help" menu of your browser.

Users can block most cookies (except for Flash cookies) by activating the setting on their browser that allows users to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if the browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) users may not be able to access all or parts of the website, or users may experience reduced functionality or unexpected operations when accessing certain services.

Unless the user's browser has been configured so that it will refuse cookies, our websites notify the user that the site makes use of cookies and allows the user to customise their browser to configure their preferences.

Most internet browsers accept cookies automatically, but you can change the settings of your browser to erase cookies or prevent automatic acceptance if you prefer. These settings will typically be found in the 'options' or 'preferences' menu of your browser. The links below explain how you can control cookies via your browser - remember that if you turn off cookies in your browser then these settings apply to all websites not just this one.
