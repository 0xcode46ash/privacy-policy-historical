# Privacy Policy - Qassia

Find out more about Qassia by reading our [About Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20080609045751id_/http%3A//www.qassia.com/mama.pl?a=p&p=about) page, if you haven't done so already. 

|  |  This privacy policy pertains to the use of the Qassia Web site at http://www.qassia.com/ (hereinafter referred to as "Qassia"), and describes our policy regarding the handling of user-specific information. 

**Information Gathered**

Qassia requires limited information to be collected from users for the functionality of the web site and its constituent systems to be effective and operational. This information varies in type and volume according to the specific requirements of the user. 

There are essentially two types of data collected from the user. Herein follows a brief description of each. 

  1. Explicit Data 

One type of data is collected explicitly. This information is invariably entered by the user via forms on the Web site, and, as such, by its very nature is given voluntarily. The information may include, but is by no means limited to, email addresses, usernames, passwords, names, rating choices, or any other information the user chooses to enter. 

  2. Implicit Data 

The other type of data is collected implicitly. This data is gathered automatically and is of a technical nature. In most instances, users will be aware that said data is being collected, as almost all Web sites collect such data. However, no specific request for the data will be communicated to the user. The implicitely collected data includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, times of access, patterns of access, and type of browsing software used. Some or all of this data may be made public via the Web site. 




**Right of Use**

Qassia has either the right to use, or the ownership of, the data collected from users. In case the information is copyrighted, the user bequests to Qassia a limited license to use the data for the sole purposes of operating the web site. In the case of, but not necessarily limited to, data uploaded by the user, the data will be electronically published by Qassia on the World Wide Web via the Qassia web site. 

**Usage Purpose**

Any data collected, in any form, will be used by Qassia for the sole purposes of operating the web site. Some data is directly essential for the immediate functionality of the web site, while other data may be used for purposes of making operational or strategic decisions regarding the improvement of the functionality of the web site. 

In no instances shall data be collected, stored, or handled for the purposes of deriving direct profit. Qassia will never sell, rent, share, information directly gathered from users. Qassia is not in the business of divesting information for profit through the direct sale of information, and will never attempt to do so. 

**Compiled Statistical Data**

In some instances, Qassia may compile statistical data based on information derived from information supplied by a large and statistically viable number of users. This data may be made publicly available. Such statistical data will never identify any individual users, or any particular data which can be linked to an individual user. In all instances, such compiled data will be of a statistical data only, and any and all contributing users whose information was used to compile the data will stay anonymous and unidentifiable. Users will not be asked for their express consent allowing their information to be used for statistical purposes. 

**Use of Cookies**

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Qassia uses cookies on its Web site. However, Qassia does not, cannot, and will not use cookies to collect private information from any user. 

Qassia uses a type of cookie which makes it possible for you to login and navigate the Web site (without having to supply the same requests over and over again). Qassia's cookies are set to expire, i.e. automatically cease to exist, within 100 days from the date when they are sent to the user's computer. _This is in contrast to many other web sites which set the expire date to in excess of 20 years._

**Preservation of Privacy Principle**

Qassia will make utmost efforts to protect the integrity of the data held by Qassia While most data collected by Qassia is of an inherently nature and expressly designated for publication on the World Wide Web, private data, such as passwords and other information not intended for publication, will never be intentionally released, traded, sold, rented, or otherwise be passed into the hands of a third party. Qassia is not in the business of selling or otherwise releasing data. Qassia solely exists as a platform for users to post information as they see fit. 

**Exceptions**

In case where Qassia has been subject to abuse by the user, or the user has harmed another user or an unidentified party, or the user has violated the Terms of Service, Qassia may cooperate with the relevant authorities and/or unilaterally publicize information, as deemed appropriate. However, Qassia will never immediately divulge private information without first attempting to resolve the issue in question directly with the user.
