# Privacy and security | Qantas US

Information on our Loyalty Program databases (including information about users of products and services available to members of our Loyalty Programs) is used for additional purposes to those outlined in the section titled '[How we use your personal information'](https://web.archive.org/us/en/support/privacy-and-security.html#how-we-use-your-personal-information "Link to how we use your personal information").

One of the primary purposes of these programs is to provide and market enhanced products and services to you, including the products and services of our partners and other third parties who we believe may have products and services in which you would be interested. Other purposes include assessing membership applications; awarding program points; confirming eligibility for and providing services associated with these programs; providing enhanced and personalised benefits and services; understanding your interests and hobbies to enhance your use of the programs; improving our services and customer service, including by means of research, behavioural analytics, product development and planning; and operational management of the programs.

For these purposes, additional information is collected by us through your registration with, and participation in, the Loyalty Programs (including your application for, and use of, a Qantas Frequent Flyer linked credit card, Qantas Cash card or any other benefit). This additional information may include information such as country of residence, seating and other travel preferences, leisure and sports interests, and information about how you earn and use your points. This information may be collected from you directly or from third parties providing services for the Loyalty Programs or our program partners, such as when you register through one of our program partners or transact with them.

In addition to the disclosures outlined in the section 'Disclosure of Information to Third Parties', Qantas may disclose this information to partner airlines, **one** world alliance airlines, and non-airline program partners for the purposes outlined above. The information may also be disclosed to any third party providing services for the Loyalty Programs (including products and services available to members), including assisting us in determining your eligibility for, and providing, these products and services, administering the programs, handling and processing membership applications and operating our call and service centres.

If you are an employee travelling or obtaining other products or services in relation to one of our Qantas Business Rewards members, we may also collect information about your role with the member, your employment type, your employee number, your start date with the member and details of any employer paid travel arrangements. If you are travelling for work purposes on a ticket purchased by your employer, we may disclose your travel details and any information associated with your travel (such as incident reports) to your employer.

When you are logged into your Loyalty Program account, Qantas may also keep logs of your use of qantas.com. This information may include date and time of visit, Loyalty Program membership number, membership status, surname, location and actions, for example, pages viewed and pages submitted. We may use this information to monitor the use of, and improve, the information and functions on qantas.com, understand your preferences and provide you with information about our products and services and our partners' products and services which we think may interest you. If you are a Loyalty Program member and are logged into your account, the information we collect may be linked with your personal information.

When you apply for and use a Qantas Frequent Flyer linked credit card or Qantas Cash card, we may also collect your personal information from, and disclose your personal information to:

  * customer verification companies for ID checking and due diligence as required for all financial products;
  * our service providers who manage, and provide customer service for, these financial products; and
  * our card partners to award points for eligible activities.
