# Privacy Policy | QSR International

## QSR Global Data Privacy Policy

   
By using this site, you acknowledge that you have reviewed the terms of the QSR Global Data Privacy Policy and agree that we may collect, use and transfer your Personal Information in accordance with the Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, you may choose not to provide any Personal Information and not to use our site. The QSR Global Data Privacy Policy Privacy also forms part of the Terms and Conditions for ordering and purchasing QSR’s products and services.

QSR International Pty Ltd A.C.N. 006 357 213 (“QSR International”) is a global organization. QSR International’s Head Office is located in Australia, with offices in the UK, US, and Japan.

The related entities of QSR International include the following:

  * QSR International (UK) Limited – United Kingdom
  * QSR International (Americas) Inc. – U.S.A.
  * QSR International Japan K.K. – Japan



For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, QSR International and its related entities will collectively be known as “QSR”. As part of the business operations of QSR, all the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by QSR’s offices around the world in accordance with this policy.

QSR is committed to protecting the privacy of its customers’ personal information and the responsible use of such information in accordance with the relevant laws which relate to data privacy and handling of such information. We have developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we collect, store, use and disclose your data used online and across regions. 

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully for a clear understanding of how we collect, use and handle your personal information on our website.

The QSR Global Data Privacy Policy is current from August 2016. From time to time we may make changes to the QSR Global Data Privacy Policy in accordance with legislative changes and business requirements.  The most current version of the QSR Global Data Privacy Policy will be posted on the QSR website.

In this Privacy Policy, “we”, “our” and “us” refers to QSR International and its related entities; and “you”, “your” and “yours” refers to our customers and third parties excluding employees of QSR.

Consent needs to be free and informed.  You must ensure you understand the purpose for the collection.

In addition to QSR’s safeguards as contained in this Privacy Policy, the relevant laws protect your personal data.

  * **Australia** \- The Australian Privacy Principles (“APPs”) are contained in schedule 1 of the Privacy Act 1988. QSR International is considered to be an APP entity under the Australian Privacy Act and must comply with the Australian Privacy Act as to how to handle, use and manage personal information.
  * **UK** \- your personal data is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998 which requires data controllers to ensure that your personal data is processed lawfully and fairly. The EU Directive 2016/679 for the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) came into force on 24 May 2016 and will apply from 25 May 2018. The GDPR intends to unify data protection laws within the EU and the export of personal data of EU residents outside the EU. It is likely that the GDPR will be implemented by the UK despite the recent announcement of Brexit.
  * **U.S.** \- Data privacy is not currently highly regulated in the U.S. Although partial regulations exist, there is no all-encompassing law regulating the acquisition, storage, or use of personal data in the U.S. With the exception of California, very few states recognize an individual's right to privacy. The U.S. believes in self-regulation of data protection by companies.
  * **Japan** – The Act on the Protection of Personal Information 2003 (“APPI”) handles the protection of personal data in Japan. The Japanese Diet passed amendments to the  APPI on 2 September 2015, of which will become effective within the next two years.



The QSR Privacy Policy protects an individual’s personal information and allows them to:

  1. Know why their personal information is being collected, how it will be used, and who it will be disclosed to. 
  2. Not identify themselves, or use a pseudonym in certain circumstances.
  3. Make a complaint if they consider that their personal information has been mishandled.



###

NCapture stores the data you capture only in the files you create. When using NCapture to capture data from social media sites, you may be asked by the site whether you wish to grant NCapture permission to collect particular kinds of data. 

Choosing to grant these permissions to NCapture:

(a)    Does not allow NCapture to capture any data that you, as a user of that social media site, do not yourself have access to.  
(b)    Does not cause NCapture to send any captured data to QSR.  
When you import data captured using NCapture into NVivo, you have the option to exclude some unwanted information (such as location or bio). Refer to the Help documentation in NCapture and NVivo for further details.

### Third Parties to Whom QSR may Disclose Your Personal Information

  * In the event of a reorganisation, merger, or sale we may transfer your Personal Information to a third party (who will be bound by confidentiality obligations) during the due diligence process.



Except as provided in this Privacy Policy, QSR will not disclose your Personal Information to a third party unless the disclosure is required or authorised by law, in an emergency or in the event of an investigation of suspected criminal activity such as fraud.

### How does QSR Keep Your Personal Information Secure

QSR has implemented security measures to protect Personal Information received from you. 

The following security measures are in place:

  * QSR uses malware scanning.  QSR’s website is scanned on a regular basis for security holes and known vulnerabilities in order to make your visit to QSR’s website as safe as possible.
  * Your Personal Information is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons authorised by QSR, and are required to keep the information confidential.
  * If you make an online application or make a payment transaction using QSR’s website, QSR takes additional steps to protect the security of your Personal Information so that your Personal Information is encrypted via a Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology (In your web browser, you can confirm that your session is encrypted by the appearance of a locked padlock symbol at the foot of the browser).
  * All payment transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers.
  * Additional security measures such as the requirement for password and login details are in place when a customer places an order and enters, submits, or accesses Personal Information via QSR’s website. 



Notwithstanding the security measures implemented by QSR, you should be aware that there are risks in transmitting information across the internet. While QSR takes measures to protect your Personal Information, QSR cannot warrant the security of any information transmitted to QSR online and users of our website do so at their own risk. QSR will remove your Personal Information from QSR’s system where it is no longer required unless QSR is required by law to store your Personal Information.

### Sharing of Personal Information within QSR Group –  Cross-border Disclosure

All the information you provide may be transferred or accessed by our offices around the world. QSR International’s Head Office is located in Australia, with offices in the UK, US, and Japan.  
The reasonable steps taken by QSR to ensure that its related overseas entities which receive Personal Information of customers do not breach the APPs are to require all overseas employees of QSR to comply with this Privacy Policy.

As a customer or website user of QSR, you give your consent to QSR to transfer your personal data between the companies in the QSR group. All data is transferred using either a secure transport layer or encrypted algorithm. A majority of the data collected is then centralised and imported into a central customer relationship management system, and housed within secure data centre facilities. This is available to staff across all regions within the QSR group by way of an encrypted secure transport layer and individual staff authentication is required.

### Cloud Storage of Personal Data

An entity can store data on remote servers operated by the cloud service provider rather than storing it on their own servers. Regardless of where you use our online services or provide information to us, the information may be transferred to and maintained on servers located outside of Australia. By providing any data through the online services, you hereby expressly consent to such transferring and processing of your data in and outside of Australia.

All data is stored with secure methods and with limited/restricted access to persons authorised by QSR. Data from the various collection points with the QSR group are stored in Australia, USA, Singapore and Ireland.

### Links to Third Party Sites

The QSR website may provide links to other sites for your convenience and information. These websites may be operated by companies other than QSR. Linked websites may have their own privacy policies. QSR is not responsible for the content of any linked websites that are not operated by QSR, or the privacy practices of those websites.

### Blogs and Other Interactive Services

QSR may provide blogs, online forums or other interactive services on its website which enable users to post and share information. Any information posted or shared by users through blogs, online forums or other interactive services will become public information and will be available to other users who access the QSR website.

### Cookies

Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.

We use cookies to understand and save user preferences for future visits and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interactions in order to offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.

If you disable cookies, some features will be disabled. As a result, your site experience may be less efficient and some of our services will not function properly.

However, you can still place orders.

### Direct Marketing

However, we may provide non-personally identifiable user information to third parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.
