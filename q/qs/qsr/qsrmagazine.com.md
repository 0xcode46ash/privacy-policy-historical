**Information Collection and Used**

When you complete any form on one of our web sites, such as a Subscription Form, registration for a Webcast seminar, submit a request for information, and other forms, we are collecting personally identifiable information such as name, email address, address, and telephone number.  We use this information to provide you with your request and sometimes to collect data about our usage or readership or about industry to disseminate in aggregate and without reference to personally identifiable information. If you view content labeled as "Sponsored," we can sometimes identify you, and we may make the sponsor aware of your identity.  
  
Orders-  
If you apply for or purchase a subscription from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). We use this information for fulfillment purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you.  
  
Third Party Subscription Requests-  
You have the option to provide the information of co-workers with whom you would like a subscription(s) to be sent (Name, email address, title). We will then send your co-worker the first issue of their subscription(s.). They will then have the option to choose to continue to receive the subscription(s). If this third party no longer would like to receive the subscription(s) they should follow the unsubscribe instructions contained in each email or go to the subscriber information pages on the website.
