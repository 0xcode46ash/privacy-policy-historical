(“qwikLABS”) is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in its business practices and strives to collect, use and disclose personal information in a manner consistent with the laws of the countries in which it does business. This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy sets forth the privacy principles that qwikLABS follows with respect to personal consumer information transferred from the European Economic Area (EEA) (which includes the twenty-eight member states of the European Union (EU) plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) and from Switzerland to the United States. 

qwikLABS complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. qwikLABS has certified that it adheres to the Safe Harbor Privacy Principles of notice, choice, onward transfer, security, data integrity, access, and enforcement.

####  SAFE HARBOR 

The United States Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles (the "U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Principles") and frequently asked questions (collectively the “U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework”) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under European Union law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from the EU to the United States. The EEA also has recognized the U.S. Safe Harbor as providing adequate data protection. The United States Department of Commerce and the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner of Switzerland have agreed on a similar set of data protection principles (the "U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles") and frequently asked questions (collectively the “U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy the requirement under Swiss law that adequate protection be given to personal information transferred from Switzerland to the United States. Consistent with its commitment to protect personal privacy, qwikLABS adheres to the U.S.-EU and U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles (hereinafter “Safe Harbor Principles”). 

####  SCOPE 

This Safe Harbor Privacy Policy applies to all personal information received from consumers by qwikLABS in the United States from the European Economic Area and from Switzerland, in any format including electronic, paper or verbal. 

####  DEFINITIONS 

For purposes of this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, the following definitions shall apply: 

"Agent" means any third party that collects or uses personal information under the instructions of, and solely for, qwikLABS or to which qwikLABS discloses personal information for use on qwikLABS’ behalf or in partnership with qwikLABS. Examples of agents may include service providers and related third parties that qwikLABS may hire to perform certain business-related functions. Other examples of agents may include lab sponsors, business partners and related third parties with which qwikLABS may enter into agreements to make its services available to users. 

"Personal information" means any information or set of information that identifies or is used by or on behalf of qwikLABS to identify an individual. Personal information does not include information that is encoded or anonymized, or publicly available information that has not been combined with non-public personal information. 

"Sensitive personal information" means personal information that reveals race, ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, or that concerns health or sex life. In addition, qwikLABS will treat as sensitive personal information any information received from a third party where that third party treats and identifies the information as sensitive. 

####  PRIVACY PRINCIPLES 

The privacy principles in this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles. 

**NOTICE:** Where qwikLABS collects personal information directly from individuals in the EEA, it will inform them about the purposes for which it collects and uses personal information about them and the choices and means, if any, qwikLABS offers individuals for limiting the use and disclosure of their personal information. Notice will be provided in clear and conspicuous language when individuals are first asked to provide personal information to qwikLABS, or as soon as practicable thereafter, and in any event before qwikLABS uses or discloses the information for a purpose other than that for which it was originally collected or discloses information to a non-agent third party. 

**CHOICE:** For personal information, qwikLABS will offer individuals the opportunity to choose (opt-in) whether their personal information is (a) to be disclosed to a non-agent third party, or (b) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

For sensitive personal information, qwikLABS will give individuals the opportunity to affirmatively and explicitly (opt-in) consent to the disclosure of the information to a non-agent third party or the use of the information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. 

qwikLABS will provide individuals with reasonable mechanisms to exercise their choices. 

**DATA INTEGRITY:** qwikLABS will use personal information only in ways that are compatible with the purposes for which it was collected or subsequently authorized by the individual. qwikLABS will take reasonable steps to ensure that personal information is relevant to its intended use, accurate, complete, and current. We will only collect and store personal information that is relevant to fulfill the purpose of the request and will retain such information no longer than appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the request. 

**TRANSFERS TO AGENTS:** qwikLABS will obtain assurances from its agents that they will safeguard personal information consistently with this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. Examples of appropriate assurances that may be provided by agents include: a contract obligating the agent to provide at least the same level of protection as is required by the relevant Safe Harbor Principles, being subject to EU Directive 95/46/EC (the EU Data Protection Directive), Safe Harbor certification by the agent, or being subject to another European Commission adequacy finding (e.g., companies located in Canada). Where qwikLABS has knowledge that an agent is using or disclosing personal information in a manner contrary to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy, qwikLABS will take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the use or disclosure. 

**ACCESS AND CORRECTION:** Upon request, qwikLABS will grant individuals reasonable access to personal information that it holds about them. In addition, qwikLABS will take reasonable steps to permit individuals to correct, amend, or delete information that is demonstrated to be inaccurate or incomplete. These requests can be made by contacting qwikLABS by email at support@qwiklab.com. 

**SECURITY:** qwikLABS will take reasonable precautions to protect personal information in its possession from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction. 

**ENFORCEMENT:** qwikLABS will conduct compliance audits of its relevant privacy practices to verify adherence to this Safe Harbor Privacy Policy. Any employee that qwikLABS determines intentionally violates this policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. 

**DISPUTE RESOLUTION:** In compliance with the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles, qwikLABS commits to resolve complaints about your privacy and our collection or use of your personal information. EU or Swiss citizens with inquiries or complaints regarding this privacy policy should first contact qwikLABS at support@qwiklab.com. 

qwikLABS has further committed to refer unresolved privacy complaints under the US-EU and US-Swiss Safe Harbor Principles to an independent dispute resolution mechanism, the BBB EU SAFE HARBOR, operated by the Council of Better Business Bureaus. If you do not receive timely acknowledgment of your complaint, or if your complaint is not satisfactorily addressed, please visit [www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints](https://web.archive.org/web/20160410000419id_/https%3A//qwiklabs.com/www.bbb.org/us/safe-harbor-complaints) for more information and to file a complaint. 

####  LIMITATIONS ON APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES 

Adherence by qwikLABS to these Safe Harbor Principles may be limited (a) to the extent required or permitted by law or legal process, such as to respond to or investigate a legal or ethical obligation or request or pursuant to court orders, subpoenas, interrogatories or similar directive carrying the force of law; and (b) to the extent expressly permitted by an applicable law, rule or regulation.
