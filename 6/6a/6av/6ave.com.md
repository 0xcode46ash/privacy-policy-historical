# 6ave.com - The Online Electronics Showcase TM

At 6th Avenue Electronics, we value your privacy. While we need to collect certain information from you in order to process your orders and make sure we provide essential customer service to our customers, we do our best to protect your personal information. Please read this statement to find out how we do that. 

**PURCHASES**  
At our website, we allow our visitors to purchase products online. In order to process the orders, we must collect your full name, address, shipping address (if different), telephone numbers, email address, and credit card information, including the type of card, the card number, expiration date, and card holder's name. We make sure that this is collected and transmitted using secure technology provided by Verisign. It is stored by us on our secure servers to allow us to process credit card reconciliations, provide customer service, and handle audits and warranty claims, among other purposes. 

As a convenience to our online purchasers, we may also offer them the convenience of being able to keep their personal information (but not their credit card information) stored in an online profile or customer account. This will make shopping easier for our repeat customers, as they will not have to reenter their information every time they make a purchase. Users who choose this option will select a username and password, which will be the only way this information can be accessed, and they will be able to modify, change, or correct their information at any time. Customers who want to delete access to their online profiles can do so by calling customer service at 866-666-6AVE. 

**MAILING LIST**  
We also allow our users to sign up for our mailing list by registering for our mailing list with their name and email address or by checking the appropriate box when purchasing. Users can remove their information from our mailing list at any time by sending an email with those instructions to [unsubscribe@6ave.com](mailto:unsubscribe@6ave.com). In addition, every email from us will come with instructions for how to unsubscribe. For customers who have not made an online purchase, this will also remove their information from our database. 

**SHARING INFORMATION**  
We will not disclose any of your personally identifiable information except as necessary to fulfill your order, or when we have your permission, or under special circumstances, such as when we believe in good faith that the law requires it. We may share non-personally identifiable aggregate demographic information with interested third parties. 

**SECURITY**  
We store all personal information on our password protected secure servers. 

**COOKIES/OTHER DATA COLLECTION**  
A cookie is information that is stored by the server on the client side of a client/server communication. Typically, a cookie records your preferences when using a particular site. Cookies are commonly used to rotate the banner ads that a site sends so that it doesn't keep sending the same ad as it sends you a succession of requested pages. They can also be used to customize pages for you based on your browser type or other information you may have provided the Web site. Web users must agree to let cookies be saved for them, but, in general, it helps Web sites to serve users better. 6th Avenue Electronics may set cookies in your computer to provide you a better shopping experience and customized information by saving you time. However you may set your browser to refuse the cookies automatically or you may manually erase it from your browser. 

For our internal purposes, we gather date, time, pages visited, originating search engine, and IP address of all visitors to our site. We keep this information for our internal security audit log and systems administration purposes, to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. 

**LINKS TO OTHER SITES**  
6ave.com may link to other sites. We are not responsible for those other sites, and we advise you to check their privacy policies.
