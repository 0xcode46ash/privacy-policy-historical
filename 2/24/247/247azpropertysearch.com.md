This Privacy Policy explains our online information practices only, including how we collect and use your personal information.

To assist you with reading, we have created our Privacy Policy as a series of questions and answers you may find most important:

### What information do we collect automatically online?

When you visit our website, we collect information about your visit that does not identify you personally. We can tell the type of computer, browser, IP address, and web service you are using. We also know the date, time, length of visit, and pages you visit and what website you came from. Collecting this information helps us design the site to suit your needs. If you are registered with our site, we will try to automatically identify you so that you don’t have to sign-in upon each return visit.

### Do we use cookies or other tracking devices?

A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on your computer or other device and makes it easy for you to move around a website without having to continually re-enter your name, password, preferences, and so on. We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, and customize web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends. These cookies do not access, read or modify any other data on your device.  All web browsers offer the option for the user’s device to refuse cookies, and if your device refuses our cookie, we do not gather any information on you through cookies, although some functionality of our website will not be available to you. We do not use cookies to track your Internet activities when you are not on our website.

### What additional information do we collect about you, and how is information used?

If you ask us a question or register with this site, we collect your contact information and additional information that you voluntarily provide to us so that we can respond to your request.

### Do we share the information we collect online?

You may ask us for information that we ask a third party to provide to you, and we share your information with them so that they can provide the requested information.
