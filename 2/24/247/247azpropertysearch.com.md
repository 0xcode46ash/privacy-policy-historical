It does not apply to other sites you reach through our site. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policies of those other parties to learn how they collect and use information about you.

To assist you with reading our Privacy Policy, we have provided answers to the following questions you may find most important:

### What information do we collect automatically online?

When you visit our website, we collect information about your visit that does not identify you personally. We can tell the type of computer, browser, and Web service you are using. We also know the date, time, and pages you visit. Collecting this information helps us design the site to suit your needs. If you are registered with our site, we will try to automatically identify you so that you don’t have to sign-in upon each return visit.

### What additional information do we collect about you online?

If you ask us a question or register with this site, we collect your contact information and additional information that you volunteer so that we can respond to your request. We’ll track your online activity and the information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web pages, used to customize the content and/or layout of our pages to optimize your website experience.

If you supply us with your telephone number online you may receive telephone contact from us with information regarding your visit to our website. If you do not wish to receive such telephone calls, please let us know by responding to the initial email that you receive from us.

### Do we share the information we collect online?

We do not share any information about you unless we are required by law to do so for authorized law enforcement, homeland security, and national security. We state on the website that when you contact us about a mortgage an officer from our preferred lending partner will contact you regarding your inquiry. This Lending partner is contractually bound by the policy and terms of this website.

### How do we handle email communication?

If you provide us with your email address and you choose to coorespond with us via email, we may choose to store these correspondences together with your registration information.  Occasionally, we may also send you email notifications relating to new offers that we feel that you might find valuable.  If at any time you wish to stop receiving these offers, you may click the unsubscribe link on any of these communications to opt-out or email your request to our website company at support@boomtownroi.com.

### Do we use cookies or other tracking devices?

A "cookie" is a small text file that is stored on your computer and makes it easy for you to move around a website without having to continually re-enter your name, password, preferences, and so on. We use cookies to store visitors’ preferences, record user-specific information on what pages users access or visit, customize Web page content based on visitors’ browser type or other information that the visitor sends.

### What if I am on the Do Not Call Registry?

If you supply us with a phone number, then you are giving us permission to call you even if you are on the U.S. Do Not Call Registry. If you choose not to be bothered, please let us know.   We will add you to our own Do Not Call list.

### What are your rights under the Privacy Act of 1974?

The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in "systems of records (SOR)" (information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier). The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act.

The Act's major provisions require agencies to:

  * Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR;
  * Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and
  * Allow you to, upon request, access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it.



We do not collect any information subject to the Privacy Act.
