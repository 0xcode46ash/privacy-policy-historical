**  
WHAT 24/7 REAL MEDIA DOES**  
24/7 Real Media operates the following interrelated business lines; more information on each may be found at [_www.247realmedia.com_](http://www.247realmedia.com/) _:_  


**Ad Network —** 24/7 Real Media represents a network of Web sites for which it sells and serves online advertisements on behalf of advertiser clients.

**IPromotions Network —** 24/7 Real Media’s iPromotions division develops customized online promotions campaigns such as sweepstakes and other incentive-style marketing campaigns.

**24/7 Website Results —** 24/7 Real Media’s Website Results division aligns keyword searches with advertisers based on the topic of the search, enabling advertisers to reach users who self-select by interest category.

**24/7 Mail —** 24/7 Real Media sold its Mail division, 24/7 Mail, to Naviant in May, 2002. 24/7 Mail is, therefore, part of Naviant's direct marketing group, and is still called 24/7 Mail. 24/7 Mail assists Web publishers in sending marketing and promotional email messages to online users that have consented to receive promotional email messages. For more information about 24/7 Mail, contact 

[_Naviant._](http://www.success@naviant.com/)

**Technology Solutions —** 24/7 Real Media's technology solutions provide advertisers and publishers with a suite of ad serving solutions, entitled "Open Adstream" ("OAS"). All of the OAS products offer publishers and advertisers the option to have their own, unique cookie™ associated to their domain, enabling them to build unique relationships with their customers while preventing third party ad serving companies from profiling their users and compromising their privacy.

A unique cookie keeps each individual user's data in a unique file that cannot be aggregated with other users' data. This unique cookie therefore prevents the profiling across multiple Web sites and the aggregation or merger of personally identifiable information gathered elseware for sale online or offline.

**  
HOW 24/7 REAL MEDIA’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ENHANCE USER PRIVACY AND PROTECT THE PROPERTY OF WEB PUBLISHERS AND ADVERTISERS**  
This data-merging practice is at the heart of the privacy debate both online and offline. 24/7 Real Media is committed to developing technologies that prevent it — protecting user privacy while also offering publishers the exclusive ownership of their customer data.

24/7 Real Media’s Technology Solutions division is comprised of the following elements, each of which has its own privacy policy and opt-out email address, where applicable.

**Open AdStream LOCAL**  
More than 850 publishers around the world use Open AdStream LOCAL to deliver ads to Web sites. The publishers who use Open AdStream LOCAL have complete ownership of all the data associated with the campaigns they serve, including the user data.

24/7 Real Media has no role in this data gathering and thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to Open AdStream LOCAL.

Users who wish to opt-out from any data gathering associated with Open AdStream LOCAL must do so at individual sites they visit.

Many Web publishers use Open AdStream LOCAL precisely because the software serves a Unique cookie file that thwarts data aggregation across a series of unrelated Web sites. It protects Web users from being profiled across multiple sites, so it actually enhances user privacy.

**Open AdStream CENTRAL**  
Much like Open AdStream LOCAL, Open AdStream CENTRAL provides Web publishers with exclusive ownership of all the data associated with the campaigns they serve, including the user data.

Since Open AdStream CENTRAL is a fully hosted, ASP-style service, 24/7 Real Media interacts with the data gathered by our client sites.

Despite this interaction, 24/7 Real Media serves a unique cookie file for each site that uses Open AdStream CENTRAL. This is true for Network customers of Open AdStream CENTRAL as well.

In the process of delivering an advertisement, promotion or email message, the 24/7 Real Media Open AdStream CENTRAL ad server, automatically recognizes certain non-personally identifiable information that is linked to a particular browser, such as the type of Internet browser an online user is using, the type of computer operating system being used, and the domain name of the Web site. Other Non-PII information collected by 24/7 Real Media's customer may be information related to pages visited within a given Web site, location of the ISP point of presence, date and time of visit, customer assigned keywords or the number of click-throughs on an advertisement. Non-PII is collected by the 24/7 Real Media Open AdStream CENTRAL service and associated with a persistent cookie set in the customer's domain. 24/7 Real Media's customer has the exclusive ownership of the persistent cookie and the Non-PII information associated with it.

Unlike other global ad serving companies, 24/7 Real Media does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above. 24/7 Real Media does not merge personally identifiable information with Non-personally identifiable information, and does not otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere.

24/7 Real Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to Open AdStream CENTRAL.

Users who wish to opt-out from any data gathering associated with Open AdStream CENTRAL must do so at individual sites they visit.

Many Web publishers use Open AdStream CENTRAL precisely because the software serves a Unique cookie file that thwarts data aggregation across a series of unrelated Web sites. It protects Web users from being profiled across multiple sites, so it actually enhances user privacy.

**Open AdStream NETWORK**  
The 24/7 Real Media Network uses Open AdStream NETWORK to serve ads to its member Web sites. The cookies that are employed on the Network serve a quantitative function and are not designed to collect and store data profiles on users. They are used to:

  * Report to 24/7 Real Media’s advertiser and Web site clients the estimated total reach of an ad campaign;  

  * Report the frequency with which an ad was shown to a user, and other measurement statistics;  

  * Ensure that an advertisement displayed to a user corresponds to the correct click-through destination;  

  * Deliver a series of advertisements in the proper sequence; and  

  * Limit the number of times a browser is delivered the same advertisement.  




Unlike other global ad serving companies, 24/7 Real Media does not use any of the data collected via cookies for purposes other than those described above. 24/7 Real Media does not merge personally identifiable information with Non-personally identifiable information, and does not otherwise parse, sort, gather, or aggregate user data for use elsewhere. Non-PII is collected by 24/7 Real Media through session cookies that terminate when the browser is closed.

24/7 Real Media thus has no reason to offer users the choice to "opt-out" of anything that pertains to Open AdStream CENTRAL.

  


**  
WHAT USER INFORMATION IS COLLECTED BY EMAIL AND IPROMOTIONS**  
24/7 Real Media collects two types personally identifiable information only through its Email and iPromotions business lines.

**Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") —** PII is personal information classified as personal to the online consumer, such as name, address, phone number and email address. PII also includes other personal information such as birth-date, zip code, gender, or lifestyle information.

  * 24/7 Real Media’s Email and iPromotions divisions collect PII on an opt-in basis only. 24/7 Real Media will not collect any PII unless that user voluntarily provides it to 24/7 Real Media. If you do not want your personal information collected online, please do not submit it to surveys, promotions, sweepstakes, or subscriptions.  

  * PII is collected by 24/7 Real Media when online users respond to a survey and provide it, when they register for an email newsletter, register for a product or service online, or enter a sweepstakes promoted by 24/7 Real Media, its subsidiaries or its partners. Selected partners of 24/7 Real Media will share information with 24/7 Real Media about only their online consumers who have consented to the sharing of their information with third parties.  




Furthermore, each individual in the 24/7 Email database has answered positively to an "opt in" question, or they have voluntarily filled out an Internet survey card to receive email solicitation about products of interest. 24/7 Real Media and its partners communicate with these users frequently to verify their "opt in" status. 24/7 Real Media also provides users with an explicit opportunity to opt-out every time an email promotion is sent.

In all instances, prior to providing PII information to 24/7 Real Media’s email or iPromotions divisions, each online user is given meaningful notice regarding the collection practice and a choice regarding the dissemination of such information. All users are informed about how 24/7 Real Media and its partners may use such information, including whether it will be shared with marketing partners or combined with other information available to 24/7 Real Media. Users will always be offered the choice not to provide PII or not to have such PII shared with others. 24/7 Real Media will not share this PII information with any partner company if the user indicates on the registration form the preference to limit the use of such information.

24/7 Real Media does not collect personal medical information or credit information, or information related to children, except in compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.

**  
HOW 24/7 REAL MEDIA USES COLLECTED INFORMATION**  
Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII is used by 24/7 Real Media in several ways, as follows:  


  * 24/7 Real Media’s iPromotions and Email divisions use the PII to deliver permission-based direct marketing messages based on a user’s expressed interests.  

  * If an online user voluntarily submits its email address to 24/7 Real Media, or one of its partners, online, he or she may receive periodic emails from 24/7 Real Media with information on new services or products being offered by our company or by one of our partners.

**  
WITH WHOM COLLECTED INFORMATION IS SHARED**  
24/7 Real Media shares the collected information only as set forth below. 24/7 Real Media does not sell or transfer the ownership of its PII or Non-PII. 24/7 Real Media provides its partners only with **access** to such information on a limited basis. Before any access is shared with a partner, 24/7 Real Media ensures that such partner publishes and adheres to strict privacy principles regarding the use of such information. Any such use is disclosed to the online user at the time such user submits information.

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII) —** in cases where an online consumer has consented to have their information shared with third parties, 24/7 Real Media will make access to the information available to selected third party partners in accordance with clearly stated guidelines.

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII) —**

Access to Non-PII is shared, in aggregated format, with 24/7 Real Media’s Web site and advertiser clients who use the aggregated data to determine the reach, effectiveness, future campaign plans, and success of their advertising campaigns. At no time is this non-PII merged with PII. It is useless to any and all parties except as quantifiable data to our advertisers and clients who wish to measure the effectiveness of their campaigns.  


**  
OPTING OUT FROM 24/7 IPROMOTIONS DATABASE**  
An online user may request removal of his or her PII information from 24/7 Real Media's iPromotions database by sending an email to [_info@ipromotions.com_](mailto:info@ipromotions.com?subject=Opt%20Out%20of%20iPromotions%20Database) or by clicking here:

This will be an immediate and permanent opt-out of our iPromotions database.

Any consumer who prefers not to provide this information online, can send regular mail to the following address:

Privacy @ 24/7 Real Media, Inc.  
1250 Broadway, 28th Floor  
New York, New York 10001  


Once a request to opt-out has been received by 24/7 Real Media, 24/7 Real Media will deliver a confirming email message to the user that the user’s PII has been successfully opted out of 24/7 Real Media’s database
