Our Privacy Policy

**Keeping It Legal**

This Privacy Policy explains in general terms how 2XU protects the privacy of your personal information in line with the National Privacy Principles.

**Your personal information**

We may collect personal information when you deal with us through our website, over the telephone, through written correspondence or when you contact us in person. Your personal information is generally collected directly from you.

We will use and disclose personal information for the main purpose for which it was collected. We may also use or disclose it for any other related purpose for which you would reasonably expect it to be used.

We do not disclose your personal information to third parties. We will never rent or sell our customer lists to any other organisation or individual.

**Keeping You Informed**

We may use the information you give us to contact you from time to time with details of special offers, promotions, competitions, and information about our products and services, unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive it. We may also use survey information and statistics for promotional purposes.

**Other People's Information**

If you provide us with personal information about someone else you must ensure that you are entitled to disclose that information to us and that, without us taking any further steps required by privacy laws, we may collect, use and disclose such information for the purposes outlined here.

**Safe And Secure**

Security is a top priority and we take steps to protect your personal information. Our website has security measures installed to ensure that personal information entered via our site is protected against loss, alteration or misuse, unauthorised access and disclosure.

Due to the nature of the Internet, it is impossible for any organisation to 100% guarantee the protection of information you provide and in the unlikely event of a breach of security we can't be responsible for any resulting outcomes.

**Keep Us Posted!**

We want to keep your personal information accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

If any of the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact us immediately on +613 98199700, email us at [privacy@2XU.com.au](mailto:privacy@2XU.com.au) or write to us at 2XU, P.O. Box 2010 Hawthorn VIC 3122 and we’ll update it.

**Accessing Your Information**

If, at any time, you would like access to the personal information we hold about you simply let us know and we will be happy to provide it to you.

**The Future**

This policy may change from time to time. If it does, we will update it on our website at [www.2XU.com/privacy](http://www.2xu.com/privacy)
