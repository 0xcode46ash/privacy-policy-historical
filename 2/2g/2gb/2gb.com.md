# Privacy Policy - 2GB.com

2GB needs to collect personal information in order to conduct its business.

Macquarie Radio collects your personal information to assist us in providing the goods or services you have requested, to process your competition entries, and to improve our products and services. We or any of our Australian related companies may be in touch by any means (including email or SMS) to let you know about goods, services, or promotions which may be of interest to you. We may also have to share your information with other persons or entities who assist us in providing our services, running competitions or with other companies who provide prizes for competitions or reader offers.

**Listeners:**  
2GB collects personal information from listeners if you call in to take part in a talk back program, or to enter a competition, or to give us feedback. We collect this information for verification purposes, and generally, we do not retain it.

**Advertisers:**   
If you or your company purchases advertising time from Macquarie Radio Network, we will collect your business contact details. We need this personal information in order to provide you or your company with our services, and to provide you with information about our services and future promotions. Unless you tell us otherwise, we will use personal information about you to market our services to you or your company.

**Business contacts:**  
Sometimes, 2GB needs to collect personal information from people we do business with. This will usually happen when we collect the name and business contact details of a person who is the contact in an advertising agency, or one of our advertisers, or a government agency or company we deal with, or in one of our contractors or suppliers. Our policy is only to use personal information collected from our business contacts for the business purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.

**Website users:**  
We may also collect personal information through our website (for example, if you e-mail the Ultimate Gardeners page on the 2GB website).

Our policy is only to use personal information collected from our business contacts or the users of its website for the business purpose for which it was collected, and not for any other purpose.

We do not collect personal information that we do not need.
