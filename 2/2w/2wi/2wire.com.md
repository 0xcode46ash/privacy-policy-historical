# 2Wire.com: Privacy Policy

**Introduction**  
2Wire, Inc. ("2Wire") has created this privacy statement to demonstrate our firm commitment to the confidential nature of your personal information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for the 2Wire corporate Website located at www.2Wire.com (the "2Wire Website"). A separate policy is available which outlines the policies and practices regarding registration information provided to 2Wire in conjunction with the purchase of a 2Wire HomePortalÂ® residential gateway or other 2Wire products.

2Wire is the sole owner of any information collected on the 2Wire Website. We do not and will not sell, share, or rent this information to anyone, unless explicitly instructed by you to do so.

**Cookies**  
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. 2Wire may use cookies to keep track of and to analyze traffic trends on the 2Wire Website in order to improve the usability of the site, www.2Wire.com. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie simply terminates. Once the user leaves the 2Wire Website, the cookies are not used in any way. If a user rejects the cookie, the user may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user experience may be limited in some areas of our site.

**Sharing Aggregated Demographic Information**  
The 2Wire Website utilizes IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements within the site, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. 2Wire may share aggregated demographic information (such as number of visits, etc.) with our partners. 

**Links**  
The 2Wire Website contains links to other sites. In some cases, visitors to the 2Wire Website may be transferred to another site, such as those of 2Wire partners, upon clicking through to such other sites. Please be aware that 2Wire is not responsible for the privacy practices of any other sites. 2Wire encourages 2Wire Website visitors to be aware when they leave the 2Wire Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to the 2Wire Website.

**Surveys & Contests**  
From time to time, the 2Wire Website may request information from visitors via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and the visitor therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and e-mail address), and demographic information (such as zip code or age level). Contact information will only be used to notify the winners and to award prizes.

**Notification of Changes**  
If changes are made to the 2Wire Website privacy policy, 2Wire will post those changes as a link from the 2Wire home page so that visitors to the 2Wire Website are always aware of any information that we may collect, how we may use it, and under what circumstances, if any, that we may disclose it. 2Wire will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
