**Introduction**  
2Wire, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy with regard to customer information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: www.2Wire.com.

2Wire, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to anyone, unless explicitly instructed by you to do so.

**Information Collection and Use**  
_Ordering_ : A user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and customer order fulfillment. If we have trouble processing an order, this information is used to contact the user.

_Other Services_ : A user may subscribe to a service, reserve a product, or otherwise provide contact information for the purpose of receiving information from 2Wire. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, 2Wire only stores this information for the delivery of the service or product. The customer contact information will be used for no other purpose.

**Cookies**  
A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a Web server to be stored on a Web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. We use cookies to keep track of a user's shopping cart, personalize portions of our site, and analyze traffic trends to improve the usability of our site. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site.

**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

**Sharing Your Information**  
We will share aggregated demographic information (such as number of visits, average distance from the Central Office, etc.) with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use an outside shipping company to ship products ordered, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

**Links**  
This Web site contains links to other sites. In some cases, personal information such as phone number and address will be transferred to another site after notification to the user. Please be aware that 2Wire is not responsible for the privacy practices of other such sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by 2Wire's Web site.

**Surveys& Contests**  
From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. For example, we survey our DSL Lookup Service registrants to gather information for our ISP customer review section. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary, and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose the requested information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and e-mail address), and demographic information (such as zip code, age level). Contact information will only be used to notify the winners and award prizes.

**Security**  
This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected with SSL encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing'. This way you will know that you are transmitting your information in a secure environment.

**Choices**  
Our users are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our DSL Lookup Service Registration form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so users can obtain additional information from us on DSL services and products.

We offer two kinds of opt-out choices at the time of registration and/or ordering:

  1. Opt-out of receiving any information from 2Wire about its broadband products and services.
  2. Opt-in to receive information from approved 2Wire partners. 



In addition, users who no longer wish to receive materials from us or our partners may opt-out of receiving these communications by replying to unsubscribe in the content area of the e-mail or e-mail us at [subscriptions@2Wire.com](mailto:subscriptions@2Wire.com). 

**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes with a link from our home page so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will request permission for such use from users by way of an e-mail. Moreover, users will have a choice as to whether or not to allow us to use their information in this different manner.
