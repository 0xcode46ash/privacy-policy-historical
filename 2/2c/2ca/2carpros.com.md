### 2CarPros.com Privacy Information

2CarPros.com has a firm commitment to the privacy of our visitors. Because the World Wide Web allows a level of information exchange not previously possible with other media, we believe it is important for our visitors to understand how our website collects information and how that information is used.

Our primary goal is to make each visit to 2CarPros.com satisfying, productive and easy for you. In order to do this, we use information you provide to create a personalized online experience that anticipates the kinds of services and information you need. Depending on the service you access, you could be asked to provide your name, e-mail address, information about your car, information about what you like or do not like, and other information specific to certain features available at 2CarPros.com. This information helps us better serve you in many different ways.

While we are working hard to create a website that is easy to use and anticipates your needs, we also want all of our visitors to be able to control their privacy. Therefore, the following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices, and will instruct you on how you can maintain the privacy standard you desire.Â 

**Your IP address**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our website. Your IP address is used to help identify you on specific parts of the site, such as 2CarPros.com, and to gather broad demographic information.

**Information we collect from you**  
Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (their name and e-mail address). This is used to access the visitor's personal 2CarPros.com page, for which we also collect information about the car or cars you drive. This information enables us to provide customized information to you about the service requirements and recommendations for your car, and to contact you when necessary (for instance, when your 2CarPros.com page thinks it is time to change your car's oil; or when a recall notice is issued for your model of car). This information also enables us to provide information to you about products or services for your car. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings at any time; see the Choice/Opt-Out Section below.

If you use our online booking service for auto repair and service, you will be asked to provide your name, address and phone number so the service center you wish to set an appointment with can contact you and confirm the appointment. This information will also be stored for you, in order for you to maintain a service history of your car. This information will be used for no other purpose by 2CarPros.com. You may elect to remove this information if you choose; see the Choice/Opt-Out section below.

Our site also uses an order form for customers to request information, products, and services. Contact information from the order form is used to send orders and information about our company to our customers. The customer's contact information is also used to get in touch with the visitor when necessary.

We run contests and conduct online surveys on our site in which we ask visitors for contact information (such as their e-mail address). We use contact data from our contests and surveys to send users information about our company. Users may opt-out of receiving mailings at any time; see the Choice/Opt-Out Section below.

All information collected, except the personal contact information gathered when a visitor fills out an order form or books a service or repair appointment, is used in an aggregate with information collected from other visitors to determine demographic trends within our industry, product preferences and purchasing habits.

**Our business partners**  
To provide you with the best selection of services and content, this site contains links to many other sites. 2CarPros.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any other website. We share no unauthorized information collected from you on our site with any other website or business partner. If you visit any of those websites, please read their privacy statement to learn how they may use the information they gather from you.

**Public Forums**  
This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Remember: any information disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose personal information.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. These measures are the most sophisticated the industry has to offer. We value the information our visitors and member service centers share with us as a trust in our care, and pledge to protect that information with all reasonable measures.
