## Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. Accordingly, we have developed this Policy in order for you to understand how we collect, use, communicate and disclose and make use of personal information. The following outlines our Privacy Policy.

  * Before or at the time of collecting personal information, we will identify the purposes for which information is being collected.
  * We will collect and use of personal information solely with the objective of fulfilling those purposes specified by us and for other compatible purposes, unless we obtain the consent of the individual concerned or as required by law.
  * The financial institutional credentials that you provide us are passed on to one of our partners and are securely stored on their servers. For improved safety, we purposefully do not store any of your credit/debit card account credentials.
  * We will not share the personal information you submit to the site, such as phone number, identity, address and credit score. This information will only be used to rate you.
  * We will only retain personal information as long as necessary for the fulfillment of those purposes.
  * We display your borrower listings publicly on the BTCJam website, together with your alias, reputation, credit rating and any information you submit to the listing.
  * Personal data should be relevant to the purposes for which it is to be used, and, to the extent necessary for those purposes, should be accurate, complete, and up-to-date.
  * We are committed to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your personal and financial information.
  * We will protect personal information by reasonable security safeguards against loss or theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use or modification.
  * We will make readily available to customers information about our policies and practices related to the management of personal information.
  * Beware of identity thieves who may try to trick you into giving them your personal or financial information. We never ask members to send personal information through email. If we ever require sensitive information, it will always be entered on the BTCJam site. If you receive such an e-mail, do not reply.
  * We do not sell or rent your information to third parties for marketing or any other purposes.
