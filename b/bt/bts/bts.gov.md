# Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) - Privacy

## Privacy Policy

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Privacy Policy explains our online information practices only. We collect no personal information about you when you visit the BTS website unless you choose to provide this information to us. Visitors are protected by the Privacy Act of 1974. However, BTS collects and stores certain information automatically. Here is how BTS handles information about your visit to our website. 

###  What We Collect and Store Automatically 

If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the website, read pages, or download information, BTS will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically through the use of session cookies. A “cookie” is a small text file stored on your computer. We use session cookies which are temporary files deleted after you leave the Internet. This information does not identify you personally. BTS automatically collects and stores only the following information about your visit: 

  * The Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" if you use a private Internet access account, or "yourschool.edu" if you connect from a university's domain) and Internet protocol (IP) address (an IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web) from which you access our website; 
  * The type of browser and operating system used to access our site; 
  * The date and time you access our site; 
  * The pages you visit; and 
  * If you linked to our website from another website, the address of that website. 



BTS uses the information we collect to count the number and type of visitors to the different pages on our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors like you. 

### If You Send Us E-mail or Order a Product

You may choose to provide BTS with personal information such as your mailing address, phone number and/or e-mail address. BTS uses the information to provide a service to you or to respond to your request. The transmission of this information is protected through the use of secure socket layer (SSL). Sometimes BTS forwards your e-mail to other government employees who may be better able to help you or use your personal information for internal purposes. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, BTS does not share your personal information with any other outside organizations. 

### Information Practices for Children 

Our website does not intentionally collect information from children under the age of 13. 

### Privacy Act of 1974 

The Privacy Act of 1974 protects the personal information the federal government keeps on you in “systems of record” (SOR). A system of record is information an agency controls that can be retrieved by name or some other personal identifier. The Privacy Act regulates how the government can disclose, share, provide access to, and maintain the personal information that it collects. Not all information collected online is covered by the Privacy Act. 

The act's major provisions require agencies to: 

  * Publish a Privacy Act Notice in the Federal Register explaining the existence, character and uses of a new or revised SOR; 
  * Keep information about you accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness in dealing with you; and 
  * Allow you to, upon request access and review your information held in a SOR and request amendment of the information if you disagree with it. 



When BTS collects information covered by the Privacy Act we will provide you a link on the web page from which we collect the information. The link provides access to our Privacy Act Notice. The Privacy Act notice will inform you what portion of the information is maintained and retrieved by your name or other personal identifier.
