# Privacypolicy

  


## Who are we?

BT Group is one of Europe's leading providers of telecommunications services. When we refer to "we" or "our" or "BT" we are referring to BT Group plc (which includes British Telecommunications plc) and its subsidiaries, or any of them, as the context requires. When we refer in this Privacy Policy to "our website" we are referring to the website at [http://www.btplc.com](http://www.btplc.com/). Other businesses within BT have their own privacy policies.

BT Group plc is registered in England number 4190816 and its registered address is 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ.

## Why do we have a Privacy Policy? 

We have developed this policy because we want you to feel confident about the privacy and security of your personal information. BT is registered under the data protection laws in the United Kingdom and takes all reasonable care to prevent any unauthorised access to your personal information. 

When we refer to "personal information" in this Privacy Policy, we mean information which identifies you as an individual, or is capable of doing so. Accordingly, we may hold and use data about you in your capacity as a Shareholder, or in whatever other capacity you visit our website.

**_Please read this Privacy Policy carefully._** If you are visiting our website or using our services, by continuing to do so, you indicate your agreement to our use of your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy. 

## What does this Privacy Policy cover? 

This Privacy Policy only applies to our website and services. It does not apply to any other BT or third party services, or to any other BT or third party sites even if we host them or you access them from our website. If you disclose your personal information directly to other companies, your personal information will be dealt with according to their privacy practices.

## What personal information do we collect about you, and when do we collect it? 

If you register for a service from BT Group, we may ask you for information such as your name, address, contact telephone numbers, email address, and other (optional) information. We may also ask you for personal information if you enter any competitions or promotions on our website.

We may receive personal information about you from third parties. Except in the cases where we are merely processing such information for them, we rely on third parties to obtain your consent for us to use this information.

## What do we use your personal information for? 

If you have registered for one of the services available through the website, we may use your personal information to:

  * Communicate with you about your access to or use of our service 

  * Let you know (by post, telephone or e-mail) about any changes to our services or our website 

  * Contact you to ask whether you would like to join in one of our research groups to help us improve our service to you 

  * Improve our understanding of the type of people we are attracting to our services and how they use our services 

  * Subject to your agreement, provide you information about BT and/or third party products and services.

  * manage our network. 

  * prevent and detect criminal activity, fraud and misuse of or damage to our network, and to prosecute those responsible. 




If you enter one of our competitions or promotions, we use the personal information you provide to manage the competition or promotion you have entered.

We may sometimes ask other companies to provide any of the above services on our behalf. If we do this, we share your personal information with them for this purpose. Please see "Do we share your personal information with anyone else?" for more information on this.

## What other information do we collect? 

We have information about your use of our services (such as the amount of time you spend on-line). We mainly use this information to manage our network.

As with most (if not all) website operators, we also collect information from visitors to our website to help us improve our website and the services we make available. This information tells us, for instance, how many visitors there were to our website, when they visited, for how long and which areas of our website they went to. This information helps us to assess which parts of our website are popular or need improving. We may share this aggregate data with our advertisers and other companies which offer their goods or services on our website so that they can see how effective our website is as a sales channel for their products but any information we would share in this way would be anonymous and you could not be identified from it. 

We **do not** use this information to:

  * identify individuals visiting our website

  * analyse your visits to any other websites (except that we do track you if you go to websites carrying our banner, but we do not identify personal details while we do this)

  * track any internet searches which you may make while on our website




## Do we share your personal information with anyone else? 

Sometimes we use other companies to provide some of our services or to provide services to us, so we may share your personal information with these other companies. However, these companies can only process this information according to the instructions we give them, may only do things with your personal information that we are entitled to do, and may only act on our behalf. In addition, they are required to meet the requirements of the Data Protection Act to keep the information secure.

We may also share your personal information with other parts of BT or other companies so that they (or we, on their behalf) can contact you with details of other products or services you may be interested in. We will only do this if you have agreed to this. 

If you agree to receive information about other companies products and services, we will only share your personal information with those companies if they agree to use your personal information for that purpose only.

If you have registered for any of the services available through the website you may choose to cancel that registration at any time, and therefore have the information held, deleted. You can do this in one of two ways:

  * return to the original registration page and following the instructions for cancelling the registration; or

  * send an e-mail to us by completing the [feedback form](https://web.archive.org/Feedback/feedbackform.htm)




Please ensure you inform us of the service which you wish to cancel.

If you do either of these, your personal details will be deleted from our database.

However, if you had previously agreed to receive information about products and services from other companies, you will need to contact those companies yourself.

We will also disclose your personal information when required to do so by law, for example under a Court Order or in response to properly made demands under powers contained in Legislation.

If there is a change (or prospective change) in the ownership of BT or any of its assets, we may have to disclose personal information to the new (or prospective) owner. 

## For how long does BT keep personal information? 

The time period for which we keep information varies according to what the information is used for. In some cases, there are legal requirements to keep data for a minimum period. Unless there is a specific legal requirement for us to keep the information, we will retain it for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be further processed.

## How do we protect your data when it is transferred out of Europe? 

Countries in the European Economic Area are required to have a similar standard of protection of personal data. This is not always the case outside that area. We do sometimes transfer data outside that area and before doing so take steps to ensure that there is adequate protection, as required by the Data Protection Act.

## How can I find out what personal information BT holds about me?

If you want specific information, please tell us, because this will speed up our reply, and give us any relevant information to enable us to locate information about you. Please also note that in some instances, we may be able to provide the information you want without you having to make a formal request as described above.

## How can I change the personal information BT holds about me?

## How do we protect your personal information? 

We are serious about guarding the security of your personal information and the details of any transactions made. We take appropriate organisational and technical security measures to protect your data against unauthorised disclosure or processing. We use a secure server to store the information you give us when you register or order (including your credit card details and your password). Any personal data you send us is securely encrypted. 

Over and above what BT does to safeguard your privacy and security, there are a number of things you can do to protect yourself from internet fraud:

  * choose a password you can remember but others will not guess, change it regularly and, if you do write it down, keep it somewhere safe and secure.

  * When you have finished your session on our website, make sure you prevent your details being seen by anyone that you do not wish to see them. So, if you have registered and logged in, remember to log off. Clear any cache so there is no record of any transactions left on screen both Netscape and Internet Explorer let you do this. We also recommend you then close your browser so any history of the session is cleared.
