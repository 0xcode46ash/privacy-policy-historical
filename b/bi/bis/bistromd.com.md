**PERSONAL INFORMATION** \- Viewing an email message or visiting our site does not enable us to collect any personal information from or about the individual. Diet To Your Door maintains the email list or web site data and in some instances, a limited amount of personal information about intended recipients, to ensure that the Campaign is accurately directed to those individuals who may be interested in receiving that type of information. We will not compile, disclose or resell this personal information.

We have taken extensive measures to safeguard our computer systems and servers, and all of our employees handle all personal information in a secure and professional manner.   


**SPAM** \- Every Diet To Your Door campaign requires our marketing partners to contractually agree that both parties will use their mutual best efforts to ensure the Campaign results in a positive email experience for all recipients of the email message. Diet To Your Door does not intentionally distribute, condone or encourage unsolicited commercial bulk email and does not intend any email Campaign to result in the proliferation of Spam. We request that all our marketing partners and clients respect and adhere to this policy and strictly conform to all State and Federal legislation relating to Spam.   


**TRACKING DATA** \- As with most websites, when you view or interact with Diet To Your Door web site or email message, our servers will automatically log and/or recognize Campaign information. This information is used not only to protect you but also to help measure the Campaign results.   


**OPT-IN PARTICIPATION** -In some email messages or web site forms, the viewer will be able to request that his/her name be added to a list of individuals interested in receiving other email messages in the future, and this list may be shared with our marketing partners in the future, but we will not release any of your personal information to any third party without your permission. For email communications you will have the opportunity to remove your name from this list at any time, using the unsubscribe button located at the end of each communication. Also, you can unsubscribe from any campaign sent by Diet To Your Door and/or its marketing partners by sending an email to: customerservice@bistromd.com and indicating the Campaign from which you would like to be removed. Your name will be immediately removed from the appropriate mailing list. When unsubscribing, please use the email address which received the communication to send your unsubscribe request.   


**PRIVACY DISCLAIMER** \- We are committed to helping you enjoy a positive email or web site experience and safeguarding your privacy, however, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted over the internet, and you do so at your own risk. Further, our marketing partners have separate privacy and data collection practices that may be different than ours. We are not responsible or liable for these independent information-handling policies, and we recommend using caution when providing personal information while interacting online.
