### Protection of Credit Card information

#### How do you protect my personal information?

We work to protect the security of your information during transmission by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) software, which encrypts information you input. When you make donations, you do so using our secure server. This makes donating to Bibleinfo.com over the Internet as secure as donating by telephone.

You can tell if you are on our secure server in two ways: a key or closed lock will be visible in the lower portion of your browser, or "https" will appear in either the address portion of your browser or in the URL of a selected hyperlink. For greater protection of your data, we recommend that you use a web-browser that supports 128-bit encryption.

#### Do you guarantee against fraudulent use of my credit card?

Your credit card is protected whenever you make a donation on Bibleinfo.com. If any unauthorized charges appear on your credit card statement within three months of your last Bibleinfo.com transaction, report this fraud to your credit card provider and contact us immediately using our phone number: 1-509-838-2761.

Most credit card companies cover all charges resulting from credit card fraud or may limit your responsibility to $50, the maximum allowed under the Fair Credit Billing Act. If your credit card provider charges you for unauthorized transactions resulting from a donation on Bibleinfo.com, we will cover this liability, up to $50, so long as certain terms and conditions are met. Bibleinfo.com is committed to making sure you're covered.

For more information, read our [Credit Card Guarantee FAQ](https://web.archive.org/donate/ccfaq.html). There you can learn how to report an unauthorized charge and how soon you can expect your claim to be resolved.
