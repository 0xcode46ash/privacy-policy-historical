# Bible.is

Bible.is Limited ("Bible.is" or "we" "our" or "us") owns or controls, and provides access to the Bible.is website, currently located at [www.Bible.is](http://www.bible.is/) (the "Website").

  * The entry of personal data on this site is completely optional and will require you to setup an account with a password and an email address. Please choose a password that is not easy for someone else to guess, such as birthday, national identification number and phone number.
  * If you want to, you can also submit additional personal information (including on your profile and on message boards). Please remember that any information you submit becomes public information that can be viewed by others.
  * Certain third parties may have access to your data (which may include personal information, but not your email contact information) via our API and web services or arrangements with our business partners. These people may use this information for their own purposes, which may be either commercial or non-commercial in nature and may include targeted advertising or direct marketing. These third parties may be based in the United States or elsewhere in the world.
  * We may use the email address provided by you to contact you from time to time about the Bible.is service. We won't pass your email address on to anyone to contact you directly about their own products or services, unless you have provided your prior consent to do so. 
  * Your pseudonymous listening habit data will be available to other Bible.is users for non-commercial use and to third parties via our API for their own commercial and/or non-commercial purposes. This statistical information is used to help third parties understand the likes and dislikes of Bible.is fans.
  * We may display links to third party sites which allow you to provide personal information to them directly. We advise you to check their terms of use and privacy policies of these sites to find out how they are treating your personal information.
  * We use cookies (which can only be read by us) to collect data that we can use to improve the efficiency and quality of our service to you. If you want, you can turn these cookies off, but it may mean that the Bible.is service doesn't function quite as well. Third party advertisement companies may also collect information (which is generally not personally identifiable) from you via cookies about the websites that you visit and your other activities on the Bible.is service. We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies if you are concerned about how they will handle your information.
  * Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our service and must not attempt to register with us and/or submit any personal information to us. Young people between 13 and 17 should not send any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet (including to us) without asking their parents/legal guardians for permission beforehand.



The Policy explains how Bible.is collects and uses information. We hope that our candor will remove any concerns you may have and will make visiting the Website a rewarding experience.

Although we endeavor to keep you up-to-date on all changes made to the Website, this Policy may be amended from time to time without notice to you. It is your responsibility to read the Policy carefully and review any changes that may have been made.

## 1\. Personal Information

In order to use certain features of the Website, you will need to register. When registering you will be asked to provide an email address and create a username and password. You may also choose to create a more detailed profile of yourself on the Website by submitting additional personal information. **Please note that even if you do not provide any additional personal information to the Website (e.g., by adding it to your user profile), if you choose a username that includes or reveals your name or any other personal information, such information may be available to other users of the Website and to the general public.**

Where you upload photographs or other content as part of your user profile, you should be aware that Bible.is is entitled to use those photographs and content in accordance with our Terms of Use. Bible.is discourages users from uploading photographs of friends or other people without their permission.

## 2\. Scripture Recordings

From the moment you register and begin listening to scripture on Bible.is, our Profile Navigation software will begin to create and maintain your record collection. This is accomplished by monitoring your activity on the website (i.e. which songs you listen to, which scriptures you skip, and the degree of difference or similarity you request when you choose to skip a particular book, chapter or verse). All of the information that is generated by your activity on the website is fed back for the purpose of monitoring user trends. Bible.is makes some of this information available to third parties to undertake development of new products and services via the API.

Bible.is does not process any personally identifiable information related to your scripture preference and/or profile in any manner other than as described in this Policy.

## 3\. Location-based Information

We keep track of the domains from which people visit Bible.is, but we cannot see a user's zip code, post code, city or country unless the user chooses to explicitly provide this information to us.

## 5\. Statistical Information

We log certain information concerning the listening, skipping and scripture-sharing activities of users and other activities whilst they use the Website, and we may match such information with personally identifiable information concerning such users. For example, it is possible for us to know which books, chapters and verses you listen to, which you skip, and which you recommend to other users. However, information related to your listening, skipping and scripture-sharing activities may be viewed by all other users (who may include other organizations or representatives of other organizations who have registered as Bible.is users) in conjunction with your Bible.is username and by third parties who have access to this information via Bible.is's API and web services, as further explained in this Policy.

## 6\. Use of Personal Information

**We will use the email address provided by you when you register to contact you from time to time. This may be for security reasons (so that we can check that you are who you say you are), to ask your opinion about the Website, or it may be to keep you updated on the services currently available on the Website and any changes to those services and those that we intend to launch in the future. We may also use such personal information to send you notices, on behalf of others and ourselves, regarding products and services that we think may be of interest to you.**

## 8\. Software Updates

In order to ensure that Bible.is is functioning at its best, from time to time we may ask you to upgrade to a newer version of our software.
