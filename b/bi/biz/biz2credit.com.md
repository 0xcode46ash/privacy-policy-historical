However, Biz2Credit does not control the actual use of transferred data by such third parties, which are governed by their internal policies and procedures. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States, in which case they may be governed by different privacy laws or policies.

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION**

**In General** : We are committed to protect the security and integrity of all information you share with us.

Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of your sensitive personal information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your personal information.

         * Session Timeout. A session timeout has been implemented so that the maximum specified period of user inactivity does not exceed 25 minutes.

         * Temporary Account Lockout. Access is locked for 30 minutes by the system if a 3 or more consecutive unsuccessful login attempts are made regardless of session or time frame.

However, the user can contact the call center/help desk to activate account when the account is locked.

          * Long Term Account Lockout. Access to accounts will be locked indefinitely (until manually unlocked by a Call Center/Help Desk Agent) if the user attempts to use login help unsuccessfully 3 or more times regardless of session or time frame. User may not login, create a new account, reauthenticate online, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. As above, the user can contact the Call Center/Help Desk to activate account when account is locked out.
