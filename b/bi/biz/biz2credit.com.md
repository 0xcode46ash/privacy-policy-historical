If you have any questions about our Policy, you can contact us through our website: [privacy@biz2credit.com](mailto:privacy@biz2credit.com), or you can write to us at the address set forth below.

  * your choices about our use and transfer of your information
  * how you can access your information

**THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

_**In General.**_ We collect information that can identify you such as your name and email address, as well as other information that does not identify you. When you provide information through our website, this information will be sent to Biz2Credit servers located in the United States.

  * _Information you provide._ We may collect and store any information you enter on our website during registration, applications or provide to us in some other manner. This includes identifying information such as your name, home or mailing address, email address, and telephone number); information about your business or prospective business; your financial information (such as your income, assets, or debts), or other personal information. We may also periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from business partners, contractors and other third parties. 
  * _Information we may request._ Examples of information that we may request and/or receive about you include credit reports, information about your business and additional demographic information. However, Biz2Credit will not request or access any credit bureau reports or other credit information in connection with a business loan, merchant cash advance or other financing product (collectively, **"loan"** or **"business loan"** ) or furnish such information to any bank, provider of merchant cash advances or other financing products or other lender (collectively, **"lenders"** ) without your prior written consent. 
  * _DocVault._ Customers also have the ability to store and access other documents and information on DocVault, Biz2Credit's information management system. These documents are protected by Biz2Credit's web security system and only the user has password-protected access. No third party has access to these documents, and Biz2Credit will only access content stored in DocVault for site maintenance and technical support purposes. Biz2Credit reserves the right to remove any content that contains a virus or other malicious code, or that otherwise violates any term of this Privacy Policy or Terms of Service.
  * _Other business tools._ Biz2Credit offers other proprietary business tools to our customers, including BizAnalyzerÂ®, the Small Business Lending IndexTM, dynamic Dashboard and Financial Calculator. All information input by our customers into these business tools are protected by Biz2Credit's web security system and only the user has password-protected access to any Business Tool where they can input information.

All the credit card information processing, including PCI security standards compliance, is done at the end of the third-party payment gateway, and we do not collect or store any such information.

Your registration information, including contact information, is never shared with any third party unless you select one of our partner links. If you select a partner link, you are informed a partner representative will contact you and that your basic business and contact information will be shared with that partner unless you opt out within the stated period of time. We will not at any time transfer your personal information to any third party unless you first select a third party service and then do not opt out of sharing this information. We may share your registration and other types of information with: 

  * _Prospective lenders._ If you submit a completed Biz2Credit Get a Loan Qualification Form, once you confirm your agreement with the Terms, we will share your information with lenders with whom you are or may be matched. However, no credit check will be performed by Biz2Credit unless you expressly authorize us to do so when you submit a completed loan qualification form. The identities of the lenders with whom you are matched, and with whom Biz2Credit has shared your information, will in each case be disclosed to you. Biz2Credit will not share information with any prospective lender not disclosed to you. These lenders on the Biz2Credit network may retain or use your information whether or not you qualify for, or obtain, a loan from them, subject to the restrictions contained in their respective privacy policies
  * _Authorized service providers:_ Once you submit a completed Biz2Credit Get a Loan Qualification Form, we may also share your information with authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These service providers include credit bureaus, title companies, insurance providers, attorneys, appraisal companies, escrow companies, closing agents and other financial institutions. Authorized service providers may also include marketing and customer services firms and credit card payment processors. These service providers may have access to information as needed to perform their functions, but are not in any case permitted to share, disclose, sell or use such information for any other purpose. 
  * _Biz2Credit Partners and Affiliates._ When you express interest in promotions or third party services, offered on our website, we may share your expression of interest with the partner or affiliate you have selected to offer you those products, services, and/or promotions.

Other people can see your feedback, businesses, products, classified ads or services that you have posted in the Community. However, no other registration or other information is displayed on the site unless you choose to post it yourself. We send notices to members regarding suspicious activity and policy violations on our sites and refer to User IDs and specific items.



_**Aggregated, non-personal information.**_ We also collect, generate, use and share Aggregated Data -- non-personalized information about you and other customers collectively that cannot be directly associated to you or any other customer. Aggregated Data may be collected from registration, applications or other use of our website or services. Aggregated Data may be used for a variety of research and analysis purposes, including in Biz2Credit's Small Business Lending IndexTM , the analysis of website metrics, and in order to develop and/or deliver targeted advertising on our website, and on websites of third parties. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or services accessed or use such aggregated, non-personal information to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. We may also combine the Aggregated Data we collect with additional non-personally identifiable information collected from other sources. In addition, we may share Aggregated Data with third parties, including advertisers, data providers and other business partners for any general business purpose. Aggregated Data is not considered "information" or "personal information" for purposes of this Information Handling Policy. 

_**Third-party websites.**_ There are a number of places on our website where you may click on a link to access other websites, each of which operates under its own Policy and not Biz2Credit's Policy. For example, if you click on an advertisement or a search result on our website, you may be taken to a website that we do not control. These third-party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal and business information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. While Biz2Credit will only directly transfer data to other websites that have adequate data protection and privacy policies, Biz2Credit cannot control such uses or use by companies whose links you click on. We therefore recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third-party websites you visit by clicking on the "privacy" link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.

_**Other circumstances.**_ We also may disclose your information:

  * In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency;
  * to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law; 
  * when we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; 
  * to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our Biz2Credit, our users, our employees, or others;
  * to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.
  * In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation or asset sale. In this event, you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out of any further promotional or other communications.



_**Third-party use of your information.**_ Biz2Credit seeks to ensure that all third parties to whom we transfer data maintain appropriate data protection protocols and privacy policies. Accordingly, Biz2Credit contractually requires its vendors and affiliates to maintain appropriate security and privacy policies, and we will not transfer personal information to any entity whose policy would permit the sale or other redistribution of personal information for any reason other than the purpose for which we provided the information to the third party. However, Biz2Credit does not control the actual use of transferred data by such third parties, which are governed by their internal policies and procedures. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States, in which case they may be governed by different privacy laws or policies. 

_**By disclosing your information to Biz2Credit through registration, the selection of services offered by Biz2Credit partners, affiliates and other third parties, the loan application process or otherwise on our website, you expressly consent to any transfer of your information as described above and in this Policy**_

**HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION**

_**In General.**_ We are committed to protect the security and integrity of all information you share with us. We have therefore implemented a number of industry-standard security measures (including physical, electronic and procedural measures) to help safeguard your information from unauthorized access and disclosure. Only authorized employees and authorized third-party service providers are permitted to access personal information, and they may do so only for specified and limited business functions. In addition, we use encryption in the transmission of certain sensitive information between your system and ours, and we use firewalls to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your information. We want you to feel confident using our website for business transactions. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure in all cases. 

_**DocVault.**_ Biz2Credit's Doc Vault system allows only registered users to upload documents. Biz2Credit does not allow any documents to be edited while in Doc Vault and maintains a log of every document uploaded, tagged and shared. DocVault's history feature also tracks every document which is shared by time and date and also time stamps when the link is clicked and document downloaded.

_**Other Business Tools.**_ Biz2Credit's other proprietary business tools, such as BizAnalyzerÂ®, the dynamic business loan and credit Dashboard, Financial Calculator and the Small Business Lending IndexTM, are also available only to registered users . Information you provide to us in connection with business loans or applications therefor will only be shared with prospective lenders with your prior consent. 

_**Account security.**_ We have also implemented the following additional features to help strengthen the security of your user account: 

  * _Session Timeout._ A session timeout has been implemented so that the maximum specified period of user inactivity does not exceed 25 minutes.
  * _Temporary Account Lockout._ Access is locked for 30 minutes if three or more consecutive unsuccessful login attempts are made, regardless of session or time frame. User may not log back in, re-authenticate online, create a new account, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. However, the user can contact the call center/help desk to activate account when the account is locked. 
  * _Long Term Account Lockout._ Access to accounts will be locked indefinitely (until manually unlocked by a Call Center/Help Desk Agent) if the user attempts to use login help unsuccessfully three or more times, regardless of session or time frame. User may not login, create a new account, re-authenticate online, order products, view products or use login help when the account is locked out. As above, the user can contact the Call Center/Help Desk to activate account when account is locked out.



For a more detailed description of these security measures, please refer to our Terms of Service, "Security Measures".
