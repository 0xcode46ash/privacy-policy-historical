Bizness Apps, Inc. (“us,” “we,” or “Company”) is committed to respecting the privacy rights of its customers, visitors, and other users of the Company Website, software platform, and all associated smartphone applications (collectively, “the Platform”). We created this Website Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to give you confidence as you visit and use the Platform, and to demonstrate our commitment to fair information practices and the protection of privacy. This Privacy Policy is only applicable to the Platform, and not to any other websites or applications that you may be able to access from the Platform, each of which may have data collection, storage, and use practices and policies that differ materially from this Privacy Policy.

**Information Gathering & Usage**

**Types of Information Collected**

**Traffic Data Collected**

We automatically track and collect the following categories of information when you visit our Platform: (1) IP addresses; (2) domain servers; (3) types of computers, smartphones, or tablets accessing the Platform; (4) types of web browsers used to access the Platform; and (5) analytics data related to mobile application use, including, but not limited to, length of time on the application, activities on the application, and features accessed on the application (collectively “Traffic Data”). Traffic Data is anonymous information that does not personally identify you but is helpful for marketing purposes or for improving your experience on the Platform. We also use “cookies” to customize content specific to your interests, to ensure that you do not see the same advertisement repeatedly, and to store your password so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Platform.

**Personal Information Collected**

In order for you to access certain services and products that we offer via the Platform, we require you to provide us with certain information that personally identifies you (“Personal Information”). Personal Information may include the following categories of information: (1) Contact Data (such as your name, mailing address, and e-mail address, or other optional information you may provide via an application); (2) Financial Data (such as your account or credit card number); and (3) Demographic Data (such as your zip code, age, and income). If you communicate with us by e-mail, post messages to any of our chat groups, bulletin boards, or forums, or otherwise complete online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such communication may be collected as Personal Information.  This shall include the e-mail addresses of those who communicate with us via e-mail, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations).

**Potential for Location Data to be Collected**

Certain applications provided via the Platform and service may provide you the choice of allowing access to your location data, particularly if you give such application access to your social media account(s) such as Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.  This means that the application provider may know the exact physical location of an end user and contact an end user to provide product offerings in a given area.  If you wish to disable this functionality, you may do so in the given application.

**Potential for Other Users to Contact You**

To the extent that a given application supports personal messaging functionality between and among end users, you may receive personal messages from other end users.  You can disable this functionality by using the unsubscribe and other disabling instructions in the given application.

**Potential for Advertisement Links to Other Sites and Applications**

A given application may provide you with an advertising link to other, third-party sites and applications.  Such third-party sites will have their own data collection practices and policies.  Please review the privacy policy for such sites and exercise caution in providing information that personally identifies you.  We have no responsibility, access, or control over the data collection practices and policies of such third-party sites and applications.  You will use such sites and applications at your own risk and outside of the scope of this Privacy Policy.  The provision of such advertisements is done on an “As Is” basis, with no endorsements or representations.

**Uses of Information Collected**

**Company Use of Information**

We use Contact Data to send you information about our company or our products or services, or promotional material from some of our partners, or to contact you when necessary. We use your Financial Data to verify your qualifications for certain products or services and to bill you for products and services. We use your Demographic Data to customize and tailor your experience on the Platform, displaying content that we think you might be interested in and according to your preferences.  We and the applications available on the Platform may use Personal Information to contact you regarding information that may interest you or to otherwise offer you coupons, services, advice, information, or other redeemable promotions.  If you wish to unsubscribe from such communications, please follow the unsubscribe instructions provided via the given application or the as provided in any such communication.

We also share Contact Data and Financial Data with our business partners who assist us by performing core services (such as hosting, billing, fulfillment, or data storage and security) related to our operation of the Platform. Those business partners have all agreed to uphold the same standards of security and confidentiality that we have promised to you in this Privacy Policy, and they will only use your Contact Data and other Personal Information to carry out their specific business obligations to Company.
