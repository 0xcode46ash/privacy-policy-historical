**BIZSUGAR PRIVACY STATEMENT**

At bizSugar, we respect and protect the privacy of those who use our website. The following Privacy Statement provides details about how your personal information is collected and used. 

**Information Collection and Use  
**bizSugar is an online service dedicated to helping users share information with one another. bizSugar is the sole owner of information collected on this website. 

In order to become a bizSugar user, you must first create an account on this website. To create an account, you are required to provide the following information: a chosen username and password and your email address. Your email address and password are not made available to the public. 

Once a user, you may provide additional publicly-available information in various areas of the website, including the "Profile" area. This includes describing yourself, your opinions and your personal contact information. Providing additional information beyond what is required at registration is entirely optional.

In order to share story information with people you personally know who are not bizSugar users, you may enter their email addresses into our "tell a friend" feature. This information will be used by bizSugar to send a link directing them to this website, including a message that you write. The email addresses of people that you invite will be used only to send your invitation.

bizSugar will communicate with you through email and notices posted on this website. These include welcome emails, occasional newsletters and notices to help inform users about various features of the service. Please be aware that while you have an account on this website, you will always receive certain emails from bizSugar related to the proper functioning of your account, such as email notices when another user has sent you a message on this website. bizSugar may send you promotional information unless you have opted out of receiving such information. Users may opt-out of receiving promotional mailings at any time (see the choice/opt-out section below).

**Sharing and Usage  
**We will never share, sell, or rent your personal information, or information collected by you through our service, with third parties for their promotional use. We may disclose or report personal information in limited circumstances where we believe in good faith that disclosure is required under the law. For example, we may be required to disclose personal information to cooperate with regulators or law enforcement authorities, to comply with a legal process such as court order, subpoena, search warrant, or law enforcement request. 

**Use of Web Technologies  
**We use a variety of technologies on our website. Like most websites, this website uses cookies to enhance your experience on the website. We also use cookies to save your password (if you choose this option) so you do not have to reenter it each time you visit the website. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our website. If you wish to disable these cookies, the "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how. However, if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access certain areas on the website. 

We may use single-pixel GIFs which are invisible graphical images. When we send you emails, we may include a single-pixel GIF to allow us to determine the number of people who open our emails. 

We also keep track of activity on our website via log files stored on our web servers. We collect information such as IP address, browser type and version, and pages you view. We also keep track of how you got to our website and any links you click on to leave our website. Once you leave our website, we do not track you. We use your website activity to assist us in offering you a personalized web experience, assist you with technical support, diagnose problems with our server, administer our websites and to tailor our service to you. 

**Links  
**Our website provides links to third-party websites, such as those of our business partners and online advertisers. While on these websites, bizSugar or its partners may collect information about you. Because bizSugar does not control the information policies or practices of these third parties, you should review their privacy policies to learn more about how they collect and use personally identifiable information. 

**Security  
**The website has security measures in place to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computer networks which may be located outside of the state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction in which you reside, and the country or jurisdiction in which these computer networks are located may not have privacy laws as protective as the laws in your country or jurisdiction. 

**Choice/Opt-out  
**bizSugar provides users the opportunity to opt-in, opt-out or change preferences via a link in the footer of most email messages. These options are also made available in the "Profile" area of your account. Alternatively, you may email us at [admin@bizsugar.com](mailto:admin@bizsugar.com)

Some communications (e.g., important account notifications) are necessary for all bizSugar customers. You must cancel your bizSugar account to unsubscribe from these communications. To cancel your bizSugar account, please email us at [admin@bizsugar.com](mailto:admin@bizsugar.com)

**Notification of Changes  
**If we decide to change our privacy statement in any way that affects your privacy, we will post those changes on the bizSugar website so that our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.

**Questions or Comments**
