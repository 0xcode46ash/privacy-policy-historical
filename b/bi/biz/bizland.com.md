# BizLand Privacy Statement

At BizLand, we are committed to protecting your privacy. The limited information we do collect is used to provide you with a personalized experience, better member service and at times, bring you value-added offers from our partners.

**The Information Collected and How It Is Used**

  * **Cookies** Our site uses cookies to deliver content specific to your interests and to save your encrypted password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site. Also, we use cookies to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. 
  * **E-mail & Demographic Data** Our site's registration form requires users to give us contact information (i.e. name and e-mail address) and demographic information (i.e. interests and business information). We use member contact information from the registration form to process quarterly Cash Back checks for our affiliate program, to send you a weekly BizLand Express newsletter and to send you information that may help your business grow. The member's contact information is also used to contact the visitor when necessary (i.e. member support issues). Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site. We use this data to tailor the visitor's experience at our site, showing them content that we think they might be interested in, and displaying the content according to their preferences. 
  * **Online Surveys** At times we conduct completely voluntary online surveys where we ask for contact information and solicit feedback on various topics from visitors. We use the collected data from such surveys to fine tune our product and service offerings. And we use contact data to follow-up with you to highlight the changes we have made to our business based on your feedback. 
  * **Contests** We run contests on our site from time to time where we may ask for your name, address, and e-mail address so we can administer the contest and notify winners. 
  * **Public Forums** This site makes chat rooms, forums, message boards, and/or news groups available to its users. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

  
**Security** All data collected at BizLand is done so with the use of secure servers. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all payment information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, all of the member data we collect is protected against unauthorized access.

**Choice/Opt-Out** Our site provides users with the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from BizLand and our partners that are not directly related to the services we provide. Please note: BizLand does reserve the right to send account-related e-mail communications to all active members.
