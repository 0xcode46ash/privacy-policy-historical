# Online Incorporation - Business Filings Incorporated Privacy Policy

**Business Filings Incorporated respects the privacy of the users of our services and web site. To that effect, we have instituted the following Privacy Policy:**

**Collection of Information from Our Clients**

In order to process your order, we need to know some standard information, such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number, and telephone number. For the purpose of forming your corporation or limited liability company (LLC) we need to know the following information: the name you want your business entity to have, a brief description of the purpose of your business, the name and address of the corporation's registered agent, the name and address of the directors and officers of your corporation or members or managers for an LLC, and how many shares of stock your corporation will be authorized to issue and the par value of such stock. We also ask for a username and password that allow you to access your account information in Business Filings' secure Online Corporate Status Center. It is our policy that the information you provide is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information. When you submit an order, your order information is encrypted with secure server software to protect the information from unauthorized access. Your credit card information and password for accessing the Online Corporate Status Center remain encrypted within our database. 

Additionally, Business Filings will not sell, rent, or trade any personal information you provide during ordering. 

**E-mail Updates and Newsletter**

Customers and website visitors may opt-in to receive Business Filings’ electronic newsletter, The Best Ideas in Business. Business Filings uses a double opt-in procedure to confirm subscriptions requests are valid. Subscribers may choose to opt-out at any time. To opt-out, simply click the Unsubscribe button, which is found both at the top and bottom of the electronic newsletter, or send a blank email to [newsletter@bizfilings.com](mailto:%20newsletter@bizfilings.com). 

Customers and website visitors may also opt-in to receive special offer emails, which are only sent from Business Filings. Such emails may include announcements of new product or service offerings from Business Filings or promotions from Business Filings’ partners.

**Business Filings values your privacy,** and promises never to sell or rent your email address for your lifetime. 

**Identifiable Information**

Our computer is not set up to track, collect, or distribute personal information about our web site visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses, or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites. When visitors type information into our online order form, but do not complete the order process, that information is temporarily stored in our database. 

Solely for purposes of confirming valid traffic from certain pay per click search engines, IP addresses for these visitors are monitored, and may be compared to the records of that search engine.

In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and from which countries those requests come. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
