**Business Filings Incorporated respects the privacy of the users of our services and web site. To that effect, we have instituted the follow Privacy Policy:** **Collection of Information from our Clients.**

In order to process your order, we need to know some standard information such as your name, e-mail address, mailing address, credit card number and telephone number. For the purpose of forming your corporation or limited liability company (LLC) we need to know the following information: the name you want your business entity to have, a brief description of the purpose of your business, the name and address of the corporation's registered agent, the name and address of the directors and officers of your corporation or members or managers for an LLC and how many shares of stock your corporation will be authorized to issue and the par value of such stock. It is our policy that this information is private and confidential. Accordingly, the personal information you provide is stored in a secure location, is accessible only by designated staff, and is used only for the purposes for which you provide the information. When you submit an order, your information is encrypted with secure server software to protect the information from unauthorized access. We will not sell, rent or trade any personal information we collect from you on our web site.

 **E-mail Updates.**

Business Filings Incorporated may occasionally notify you of new services and special offers via e-mail updates. If you would rather not receive any updates from us, please send a request to be removed from our e-mail update list to: info@bizfilings.com.

 **No Computer Tracking of Identifiable Information**

Our computer is not set up to track, collect or distribute personal information about its visitors. It does recognize the home server of visitors, but not e-mail addresses. For example, we can tell which Internet Service Provider our visitors use, but not the names, addresses or other information about our visitors that would allow us to identify the particular visitors to our sites.

In addition, our web sites track information about the visits to our web sites. For example, we compile statistics that show the daily number of visitors to our sites, the daily requests we receive for particular files on our web sites, and what countries those requests come from. These aggregated statistics are used internally to better provide services to the public and may also be provided to others, but again, the statistics contain no personal information and cannot be used to gather such information.
