## _JDD Publishing's Bizweb2000.com...  
**Private and Secure**_

JDD Publishing has been doing business online since 1996. Over the years, some 20,000+ customers have placed orders from our websites -- privately, safely and securely.

In order to demonstrate our firm commitment to you, our web site patrons and customers, we'd like to share our policies on information gathering, privacy, security, returns, unsolicited email, and more...

**1\. Your Personal Information:** Our site uses forms for information requests and orders. Contact information from all forms (including name, address, email address, payment info, etc.) is used to process and deliver orders and mail information about our company to our customers. At no time will we share any of this information with any other person or company. Any financial information our customers submit, such as credit card number and expiration date is used _only_ to charge the customer for [products and services](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205025544id_/http%3A//www.bizweb2000.com/products.htm) they are purchasing.

**2\. Security:** This site has extensive security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All orders are processed using SSL technology via secure server. All customer contact information including credit card number and name and address is guarded with the utmost security and discretion. 

**3.** **Return Policies:** We offer a "no questions asked" return policy on all our products. If you're not 100% satisfied, we want you to tell us!

**4\. Unsolicited email:** We **** do ****_not_ **** use, nor do we condone the use of unsolicited bulk email. **** Validated complaints against our [affiliates/associate publishers](http://www.bizweb2000.com/hlpwantd.htm) result in cancellation of their account(s). We take this issue very seriously. Please report any incidents of unsolicited email coming from or mentioning the bizweb2000.com domain to [ webmaster@bizweb2000.com](mailto:webmaster@bizweb2000.com) for a prompt and personal reply. All matters will be investigated and dealt with promptly.

**5.** **Subscribe/Unsubscribe:** We offer a free e-newsletter, [The BizWeb E-Gazette](https://web.archive.org/web/20061205025544id_/http%3A//www.bizweb2000.com/sample.htm). We never rent this opt-in list of email addresses. We do however, offer [sponsorship advertising](http://www.bizweb2000.com/ads.htm) in each issue and send special alerts and promotion / sale announcements to our subscribers from time to time. (Average quarterly) Subscribers may opt-out of receiving any future messages by sending an email message to: [ webmaster@bizweb2000.com](mailto:webmaster@bizweb2000.com?subject=remove%20from%20all%20subscriber%20lists) from the address which they subscribed.

**6\. Cookies:** Cookies are small bits of data that can be stored on visitors computers. BizWeb2000 uses cookies at links to various affiliate programs, to ensure proper commission tracking. We also use cookies to handle special popup windows which contain giveaways and limited offers. 

**7\. Public Forum:** This site makes available a [discussion forum/message board](http://www.bizweb2000.com/wwwboard). Please remember that any information that is disclosed in that area becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information.

## 8. **Children’s Privacy:** We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems. BizWeb2000.com encourages parents to go online with their kids. Here are a few tips to help make a child's online experience safer:

* Teach kids never to give personal information, unless supervised by a parent or responsible adult. Includes name, address, phone, school, etc. 
* Know the sites your kids are visiting and which sites are appropriate. 
* Look for Web site privacy policies. Know how your child's information is treated.
