# Note: Your personal information will

Note: Your personal information will only be used for the purpose of research and never for selling
anything to you, nor for advertising purposes. The Bizpinion Research Community is comprised of
business professionals from all walks of industry. Bizpinion invites its website visitors to join a panel
community of willing respondents to express opinions on various topics. We assist firms in making
better decisions through the use of information. We understand the need to have a formal privacy policy
and are committed to protecting the privacy of our clients, panelists and visitors.
We endeavor to conform to the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (CASRO) Code of
Standards and Ethics for Survey Research, the American Association for Public Opinion Research
(AAPOR) Code of Professional Ethics and Practices and all relevant US regulations regarding privacy.
Bizpinion is active in supporting the following additional organizations created to uphold ethical survey
research practices:
    •   Marketing Research Association (MRA)
    •   American Marketing Association (AMA)
    •   Advertising Research Foundation (ARF)
    •   European Society of Opinion and Marketing Research (ESOMAR)
Information drives the research process. Bizpinion gathers your personal information upon registering to
become part of our Research Community including, but not limited to, your demographics and career
information. After registering we may ask panel members to provide us with additional personal
information in order to invite them to appropriate surveys. We require your email address in order that
we can send you email invitations to participate in our upcoming surveys. The additional information we
gather, such as your address, gender, birthday, and employment status, is used to match you with the
appropriate market research projects. We will never share your birthday, but it is required to
automatically update your age for age-related survey opportunities. We only use your information in
order to send you opportunities to participate in market research.
Bizpinion Research Community encourages panel members to supply demographic information (gender,
birth date, income level, employment, and medical conditions) and keep that information current as it
will be used to pre-qualify panel members for survey opportunities and for topics that would be of
interest to them. Occasionally we ask panel members and survey participants for additional information
related to their interests, hobbies and product usage. Such information facilitates our ability to send
surveys corresponding with their area of interest and expertise.
We may also be required to collect social security numbers of panel members for tax purposes in
connection with incentive fulfillment.


Occasionally we may use a trusted third-party for email list management and email distribution, or may
use third party list management providers to match the members of our Panel to members of other lists
or panels, or to validate accuracy of personal information provided by the panelists. Third parties may be
used to provide us with data they have collected about you, and append this data to your demographic
profile. In such cases only a minimum amount of information is transferred to these third parties so as to
enable them to perform specific functions on our behalf and to ensure your privacy. If a panel member
desires to end his or her membership with Bizpinion, such panel member may terminate their
membership by (a) following the instructions set forth in their membership account, (b) sending an email
request to wendy@bizpinion.com, from the email address associated with their membership, or (c)
selecting the opt-out link contained in each email invitation sent to members of our panel. Regardless of
the method used, opting out deactivates the member's account and terminates their membership
(including all redemption reward points earned) with Bizpinion.com.
Bizpinion will then deactivate the applicable membership account and the individual will not receive
any further survey invitations; the individual may continue to receive some previously prepared survey
invitations for a few days following the termination of membership. Bizpinion will retain the personal
information of a terminated member for an indefinite period of time. Even after termination of
membership Bizpinion will continue to protect such personal information in accordance with this
Privacy Policy.
Digital fingerprinting is a technique used to assign a unique identifier to a user's computer to identify
and track the computer. Bizpinion will NEVER use digital fingerprinting to collect personal
information, or track online activities. Also, Bizpinion will not interfere or disrupt the control or use of
a computer or alter, modify, or functionally change the settings of a computer.
Bizpinion may use digital fingerprinting to assist our clients in establishing and ensuring the integrity of
survey results. To do this Bizpinion (a) might associate or link said unique identifier to you and any of
your personal information; (b) may share your unique identifier with our clients and with other sample
or panel providers; and (c) may receive or obtain a unique identifier linked to you from a related or
unrelated third party. Any unique identifier received or obtained by Bizpinion and linked to a specific
individual will be protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
