This technology also includes the use of cookies which benefit visitors by saving their information so they don't have to retype it on subsequent visits to our site.

We also collect payment information in order to bill shoppers for items they ordered. To complete business transactions, credit card numbers are verified by a qualified financial institution using secure encryption technology before an order is shipped.

In some instances, when an e-mail address has been provided by the visitor, and the visitor is 18 or older, we will send notices to the visitor, usually in the form of e-mail. These periodic notices will announce the status of an order, Web site changes, special promotions and other similar updates.
