Birthday Express.com is very concerned about the protection of online privacy for all our Web site visitors. Although we track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site, personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process. 

Our Web site uses Microsoft Site Server technology which allows IP Addresses to be collected and used for administrative purposes, and to analyze traffic patterns for this site. However, no single individual is identified in the analysis of Web traffic. This technology also includes the use of cookies which benefit visitors by saving their information so they don't have to retype it on subsequent visits to our site. 

We make it our top priority to safeguard the privacy of our online customers, and we take great care in making sure that your personal identifiable information is secure. We limit access to personally identifiable information to a very small number of employees who are committed to our privacy and security policies, and who need access to the information in order to perform their jobs. We review our Web security, and our security policy and practices, with employees on a monthly basis. And all employees are required to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Any employee who violates our privacy and/or security policies is subject to immediate disciplinary action. 

Birthday Express.com collects only personally identifiable data, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and the like, when voluntarily submitted by visitors. We also collect financial information in order to bill shoppers for items they ordered. In some instances, when an e-mail address has been provided by the visitor, and the visitor is 18 or older, we will send notices to the visitor, usually in the form of e-mail. These periodic notices will announce Web site upgrades, new product information, and other similar updates. Birthday Express.com does not provide any personally identifiable information to third parties. 

We collect e-mail addresses of individuals who communicate with us via e-mail, and when such information is volunteered by the consumer, such as when ordering products from our company. The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site and used by us to contact consumers for marketing purposes, and when confirming orders. 

If you do not wish to receive marketing-related e-mail from us, you may opt-out by [clicking here](https://web.archive.org/web/19991110045528id_/http%3A//birthdayexpress.com/bexpress/info/unsubscribe.asp) and we will immediately honor your request.

When requested, Birthday Express.com will send our online newsletter, Birthday Expressions, to individuals via e-mail.

Each newsletter also includes instructions on how you can stop receiving the newsletter in the future.
