Request a Paper Catalog

Although it is sometimes convenient to have a printed catalog to view, we have decided not to offer a paper catalog. Our decision not to offer a paper catalog saves resources and helps keep our prices low.

A paper catalog can quickly become out-dated while our online catalog is always up-to-date with our latest products. Therefore, we have devoted our merchandising efforts to an extensive online catalog with new items added on a frequent basis.

Terms of Sale

Because we offer rapid order processing, in most cases, we can not make changes to your order, once it has been submitted.

Normally orders are shipped within 1 business day. Stock is usually on hand for all products shown in our online catalog for immediate shipment.

All orders must be prepaid with US dollars in the form of a credit card. Fax/mail in orders must pay in the form of a cashier's check or money order made payable to "Birthday Direct, Inc.". We accept Visa, Master Card, Discover, and American Express. Ownership of products transfers to you upon delivery to the carrier.

The current prices shown on this web site supersede any previous price list. Due to market conditions, our prices may change without notice.

Product Disclaimer

We do our very best to make sure our products are as close to the exact product as possible in both our product images and descriptions. However, certain circumstances may cause actual product size and color to vary from that presented on our website.

Due to the many variations in monitors and browsers, product colors may appear different on different monitors. Computer monitors are not all calibrated equally and color reproduction on the Internet is not precise. Since it is not possible to guarantee our online colors will look the same on all computers, we cannot guarantee that what you see on your monitor accurately portrays the color of the actual product.

Due to manufacturing conditions, actual product sizes may vary slightly from product descriptions. Our objective is to provide you with as much information and detail about the product as possible. Please understand that sometimes typographical errors occur. We will never try to intentionally deceive or misrepresent our products.

If exact size and color matching is of extreme importance, it is highly recommended that you order a "test" product before placing your complete order. We hope you understand these circumstances as it is an issue for all online and catalog retailers.
