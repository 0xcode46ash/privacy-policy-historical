PRIVACY POLICY  
Protecting your privacy is important to us at Birthnet Pty Ltd (ACN 089 827 878) and all our related companies (collectively known as "Birthnet"). As part of our commitment, we have developed the following policy in compliance with the voluntary National Privacy Principles developed by the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner. 

Our privacy policy will help you understand how Birthnet collects, uses and safeguards any personal information provided to us by you. This policy should be read in conjunction with the [terms and conditions](https://web.archive.org/about.asp?terms) governing use of this website.   
  
1\.  | What you should know about your privacy  
Whenever a member, or subscriber, voluntarily discloses personal information online - for example on message boards, through email, or in discussion areas - that information can be collected and used by others. If a member posts personal information online that is accessible to the public, they may receive unsolicited messages from other parties in return. Whilst we discourage the collection of emails for the purposes of unsolicited emails, Birthnet cannot be held responsible for any messages, advertising material, spam or other information sent to you by third parties that obtain your details in this way.   
2\.  | What you can do to protect your privacy  
You can also play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the secrecy of your subscription password and/or any account information. Please also remember to logoff and close your browser when you have finished your user session. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place. You are responsible for the security of and access to your own computer. 

Please notify us immediately if there is any unauthorised use of your membership account by any other Internet user or any other breach of security.   
  
3\.  | What personally identifiable information is collected from you through our website  
When you become a subscriber of birth.com.au, you will be provided with a unique user ID or passcode. You can change this passcode by going to your 'account' page once logged on. You will be required to provide your name and email address. If you live outside Australia, your residential address is also required if you are not paying Australian GST . You may also be asked to provide additional information such as your gender and age group. Information of this type is optional and need only be provided if you wish to do so. 

To subscribe to birth.com.au, you may click on the NAB symbol displayed on the payment page of the website. This will link you to the National Australia Bank, which will record your credit card and payment details. The NAB will then email us with confirmation of payment and email you with the receipt. We will not see any credit card details unless you elect to pay our subscription fees by fax, telephone or mail. If you do provide us with credit card details, we will hold them in the strictest confidence. 

Birthnet does not use "cookies" (text files containing information about your website preferences which is stored by your browser on your hard disk). However, it is the requirement of the National Bank's Secure Internet Payment Service (N-SIPS) that all subscribers paying by credit card via the internet have their Web browser option 'on' to accept cookies to facilitate their one-off payment. Cookies are used to participate as a user in the 'birthtalks' forums to hold your username, password and viewing options to allow you to login. IP addresses can be viewed by Birthnet administrators in the birthtalks discussion forums, but are not used for tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer. 

The only way Birthnet can know who each member is, is if the member logs on using their user name and password. When the member does this, it allows us to: 

a) Provide access to each member's account information and the services available to them as members of birth.com.au; and 

b) Track each member's progress through the site and the time they spend so that we can better understand how the site is used and make improvements to its functionality. 

Birthnet may also ask members for personal information at other times, including (but not limited to) member surveys, contests or promotions sponsored by birth.com.au or when a member reports a problem with our site or services. If a member submits feedback about our site's features and content, we will keep a record of that correspondence. Wherever birth.com.au collects personal information we will include a link to our Privacy Policy on this page.   
  
4. | The organisation collecting the information

Birthnet will not share personally identifiable information about any visitor and/or member and/or subscriber with unrelated third parties without first obtaining the consent of that person. Birthnet will not sell or disclose your personal information to unrelated third parties without your consent. 

We may share non-personal, aggregate information about our customers, sales, traffic patterns, and site usage with unrelated third parties, including sponsors and advertisers. We may also disclose account information in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may by violating birth.com.au's Terms and Conditions of Use or may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) birth.com.au, other birth.com.au users, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.

6\.  | Receiving email from birth.com.au  
Birthnet will contact you by email when you subscribe, or register as a member for the forums and to respond to any questions or problems you may notify us of. We use email links on the 'about us' page of our website to allow you to contact us directly with any questions or comments you may have. We read every message sent in and try to reply promptly to each one. 

If you are interested, we can also send you email communications to provide information which we think you will find useful, including announcements about new products and services from Birthnet, sales alerts and newsletters on specific topics, as well as communications on behalf of third-party companies who offer products and services we think would be of value to you. It is our policy to send such email only to members or subscribers who explicitly give us permission do so. In every such email message, we will also have instructions on how to unsubscribe so that you will not receive any such messages from Birthnet in the future if you do not wish to.

Birthnet endeavours to protect the quality and integrity of your personal information. Birthnet has implemented appropriate technical and managerial procedures to maintain information that is accurate, current, and complete, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. 

While we strive to protect your personal information, birth.com.au cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or receive from our services. These activities are conducted at your own risk.   
  
9\.  | Chat rooms, bulletin boards and discussion forums  
Birthnet provides public forums for our visitors, members and subscribers to read and share information with other individuals. Disclosing personally identifiable information online through chat rooms, forums, and message boards makes the information submitted public information. Please be careful, and use discretion when disclosing any information in such a public forum.

When you order products from these vendors, all information provided by you (such as credit card details) will be collected and held by that vendor. It is up to you to satisfy yourself that the vendor's privacy policy is acceptable to you. 

Birthnet may also have arrangements with third parties who provide advertising banners or sponsored links. These linked sites are not under the control of birth.com.au, and we are not responsible for the conduct of companies linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the privacy policies / terms and conditions of using their websites. If you have questions about the privacy policies of such third parties, we suggest contacting them directly or visiting their websites to review their posted privacy policies. Please note that this privacy policy does not apply to use of third party sites that are available through and/or hyper linked to the birth.com.au website.
