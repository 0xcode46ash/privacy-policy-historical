Birds Eye Foods handles your personal information with care. We only ask for personal data that will allow us to serve you better and we carefully safeguard this information. No personal information is ever shared or sold to third parties except in the following limited circumstances:

  * Agents: We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. They may have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
  * Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy companies or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, in the unlikely event that Birds Eye Foods, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
  * Legal Protection: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with law; enforce our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Birds Eye Foods or others.
  * With Your Consent: Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when information about you might go to third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.



If you can choose not to provide certain information, you might not be able to take advantage of some of the website features.

Content on other domains, even those linked to by Birds Eye Foods, is not covered by this privacy policy. Birds Eye Foods does not guarantee the content of any third party sites and advises users to review the privacy policies of all sites before submitting personal information.

Birds Eye Foods collects names, mailing addresses, email addresses, telephone/fax information, and in some cases description of products purchased, personal recipe information, or personal anecdotes through the online properties listed above. Birds Eye only gathers personal information voluntarily provided by a user.

Personal information gathered is used for internal purposes only. These purposes include but are not limited to: replying to online customer inquiries, accepting online recipe and story submissions, and operating opt-in marketing email campaigns.

Federal law mandates that sites directed to an audience of children under age 13 only gather information from children that is reasonably necessary to participate in the website's activities. Although Birds Eye Foods offers online activities designed for children under 13, no personal information is required or gathered. If you are under 13, you should not submit any personal information to us.

Birds Eye Foods reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time and any changes will be posted here. Unless stated otherwise, our current Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you.
