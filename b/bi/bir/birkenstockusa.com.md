## Data Analytics

Our Site uses “cookies”, which are small data files that are stored on your computer when you visit a website. Cookies enable you to shop on our Site and may be used in a variety of ways to enhance or personalize your online browsing and shopping experience. For example, we may use cookies to remember the items in your shopping cart, store your preferences, recognize you when you return to our Site, track your orders, and monitor and maintain information about your use of our Site.

You may be able to set your browser to not accept cookies, or to notify you when you are sent a cookie so that you may decide whether or not to accept it. If you do not accept cookies, however, you may not be able to access your account information or make purchases on the Site.

This Site uses third-party web analytics services such as Google Analytics to help us analyze how visitors use the Site. To learn more about opting out of data collection through Google Analytics, [click here](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

Your web browser may have settings that allow you to transmit a “Do Not Track” signal when you visit various websites or use online services. Like many websites, this Site is not designed to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from browsers. To learn more about “Do Not Track” signals, [click here](https://allaboutdnt.com/).

Information about your use of the Site and other websites may be collected across time and services, and used for various purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and to deliver relevant and retargeted content, including interest-based advertising.  


## Information Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your information, except as is described in this Notice. We may permit our agents, vendors, consultants, and other service providers to access information collected through the Site to carry out work on our behalf. For example, we may share your information with our service providers who help us to fulfill customer orders, send communications, or conduct surveys. We do not authorize these service providers to make any other use or disclosure of your information.

In the event of a sale, merger, or other transfer of our assets, personal information and other information we have collected as described in this Notice may be among the transferred business assets, or may be shared with third parties as part of the transaction or negotiation.

We may release your information if required to do so by law, or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with any law, or to respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant. We also reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information as appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Use, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves against third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Site, or to protect anyone’s rights, property, or personal safety.  


## Security

Although the security of information transmitted via the Internet cannot be guaranteed, we strive to provide you with a safe and convenient shopping experience. We have implemented appropriate safeguards to protect the security and privacy of personal information we obtain through the Site. For example, when you enter your personal information on our Site, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your information as it is transmitted to us. To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the URL or Location line of your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from "http" to "https."  


## Links to Other Websites

For your convenience and information, this Site may contain links to other websites that may have privacy policies that differ from our own. We are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of any linked site that we do not control. We recommend that you review the privacy policy of any site that you access through this Site.  


## Remarketing

**Use of Google Remarketing:** This website uses the remarketing feature of Google Inc, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA (“Google”). This feature makes it possible to present interest-based advertising to website visitors as part of the Google Network. The remarketing feature uses "cookies", small text files, which are stored on your computer. They are used to remember your information and settings when you visit websites that are part of Google's advertising network. These websites can then show you relevant ads that refer to the content you previously viewed on websites that use the remarketing feature of Google.

According to Google, it does not collect any personally identifiable information in this process. If you do not want the remarketing feature to be used, however, you can always disable it by changing the appropriate settings at <http://www.google.com/settings/ads>.  


**Use of Facebook Remarketing:** On our website, the remarketing feature of Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA (“Facebook”) is used. It allows us to show visitors to our website personalized, content-related Facebook ads when they visit the social network Facebook.

Our website therefore contains remarketing tags from Facebook. Through these tags, your browser establishes a direct connection to the Facebook servers when you visit our website. Facebook is informed which of our websites you have visited and can assign this information to your personal Facebook profile. This information then enables us to display personalized, interest-related Facebook ads.

Please refer to Facebook’s [Data Policy](https://www.facebook.com/privacy/explanation) for information on the purpose and scope of data collection and the processing and use of the data by Facebook, as well as the rights and settings to protect your privacy. If you do not want Facebook to assign the collected information directly to your Facebook profile, you can disable the function [here](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads#_=_) when you are logged in to Facebook.

**Use of Rocket Fuel Inc.’s Remarketing Feature:** We use the services of Rocket Fuel Inc., San Francisco, California, USA, ([www.rocketfuel.com](http://www.rocketfuel.com/)), to collect statistical data about the use of our website and to optimize the site for you accordingly. More information about how this data is processed and used can be found in Rocket Fuel Inc.’s privacy policy, which is available here: [www.rocketfuel.com/privacy/](http://www.rocketfuel.com/privacy/) You can prevent Rocket Fuel Inc. from collecting and saving this data about you in the future by visiting [www.rocketfuel.com/opt-out/](http://www.rocketfuel.com/opt-out/) and clicking on the word “here” in the section labeled “Opt Out”.
