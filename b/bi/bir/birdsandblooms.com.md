# Privacy Policy | Birds & Blooms

The policy below applies to the following websites owned and operated by Reiman Media Group, Inc. (collectively “Reiman Websites” or “Websites” ) [www.birdsandblooms.com](http://www.birdsandblooms.com/), [www.reminisce.com](http://www.reminisce.com/), [www.countrywomanmagazine.com](http://www.countrywomanmagazine.com/), [www.country-magazine.com](http://www.country-magazine.com/) and [www.farmandranchliving.com](http://www.farmandranchliving.com/). For privacy policies regarding our other websites, please go to the individual website and click through to its privacy policy.

Your privacy is important to us. With that value in mind, we’ve developed this privacy policy (this “Policy”) explaining the ways in which we collect personal information for the Reiman Websites and how we protect it, and what choices you have about how information is used.

**Changes to this Policy**

We may revise or update this Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will post the revised Policy on the Websites and update its “last updated” date. We encourage you to check this Policy whenever you visit the Websites to see if it has been updated since your last visit.

**Scope of this Policy**

This Policy distinguishes between personally identifiable information, which we refer to as “personal information,” and “aggregate information” and other forms of non-personally identifiable information.

Personal information as used herein means information that personally identifies you, such as your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card or other account number, and other information that is linked to personal information about you.

Aggregate information is aggregated information from which we have removed individual identities or other personal information, or information that we collect about the Websites or about a group or category of products, services or customers that does not identify you personally. Aggregate data helps us understand trends and our users’ needs so that we can better consider new features or otherwise tailor our Websites.

This Policy applies to personal information collected by us on the Websites. This policy in no way restricts or limits our collection and use of aggregate information.

**How We Collect Personal Information**

Information you provide to us. We may collect certain information that you voluntarily provide to us when you use the Websites. You may provide personal information to us at various locations on the Websites. For example, we may collect your name, billing and shipping address, email address, telephone number, and credit card account number when you register and set up an account, subscribe to a newsletter or other publication, or purchase products or services on the Websites. Personal information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection with participating in discussion forums, blogs, social networking services, or other interactive services on the Websites. In addition, we may collect personal information you provide in connection with sending us emails or other communication through the Websites or your participation in or response to surveys, sweepstakes, contests, games, promotional offers, and other activities on the Websites. We may also collect other information about you that we may associate with your personal information such as your interests, preferences and demographics. For example, we may collect information about your interests in certain lifestyle topics. We collect this personal information for example, when you order a product, enter a contest or sweepstakes, request a catalog or register for a mailing list.

From time to time, we may make available certain applications for use on mobile devices (each application an “App” and each mobile device a “Device”). The type of Personal Information we collect will vary by App, but may include both precise and non-precise geolocation information in order to provide you with access to local service, offers and promotions relevant to the App (e.g., coupons for local stores). It is our practice not to store precise location information outside of your Device. In most instances, you will be provided with the ability opt-out of collection of location-based information in the user account settings for the particular App. As a general practice, we do not share precise location information with third parties except as necessary to complete a request that you initiate. Each App will include its own privacy policy explaining how we collect Personal Information when you use that App. You should always read the Privacy Policy before downloading the App.

We, our related web hosting providers, and our advertisers and ad serving and tracking companies sometimes utilize “cookie” technology on the Websites. Cookies are bits of data stored on your hard drive that contain no personally identifying information but which help enhance your web-browsing experience. Not all web browsers accept cookies, and those that do usually provide a preference or setting that allows you to refuse and remove most types of browser cookies. If your browser does not accept cookies, you may still enjoy our Websites.

We may also use local shared objects, also known as Flash cookies, to store your preferences such as volume control for videos, or display content based upon what you view on the Websites to personalize your visit. Third party partners provide certain features on the Websites and may display advertising based upon your web browsing activity, using Flash cookies to help track and store information about you. Flash cookies are different from browser cookies because of the amount of, type of, and how data is stored. Cookie management tools provided by your browser usually will not remove Flash cookies. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for certain Flash cookies, click here.

Web Beacons. We may use, and may permit third parties to use, “Web beacons” (also known as pixel tags, clear GIFs and web bugs) on the Websites and in email communications we send. We use Web beacons to monitor the effectiveness of advertising, to track aggregate Website usage, and for other lawful purposes. These web beacons do not collect personal information about you on the Websites.

Automatically collected information. We collect into our log files certain standard information from your web browser—such as your IP address, browser type and language, screen size and the time of your visit—when you visit the Websites. This information is used by us to analyze trends, administer the Websites, and gather broad information for aggregate use. We may aggregate some or all of the information we collect from our log files to information stored on a cookie in your computer. We also collect information about keyword searches performed by visitors on the Websites. We do not collect your name or email address as a result of using a search feature. We may keep logs of all words searched to help us learn what kinds of information visitors to the Reiman Websites are seeking, and to improve our service to visitors.

**Disclosure of Personal Information**

Except as set forth in this Policy, we do not disclose, sell, rent, loan, trade or lease personal information we collect on the Websites to any third party.

We will disclose personal information in the following circumstances:

If you consent to the disclosure of your personal information, we may share your personal information with our affiliates, our technical consultants, third-party auditors and other third parties who act on our behalf, for example, to make the Websites available, enhance its functionality, or provide associated services and/or who deal with you in delivering content, samples, products, and gifts and prizes, have access to and may use this information to provide us with services.

Occasionally, we may make names and postal addresses we collect through the Websites along with certain other information about you such as your interest in particular lifestyle topics available to reputable companies whose products and/or services may interest you, unless you opt out of being included in our postal mailing list. (See the section below on opting out of postal mailings).

We may transfer your personally identifiable information and other information in connection with or during negotiation of any merger, financing, acquisition or dissolution, transaction or proceeding involving sale, transfer, divestiture or disclosure of all or a portion of our business or assets to another company.

We will consider, and may release, personal information to third parties: to (i) comply with laws or to respond to lawful requests and legal process, (ii) to protect our rights and property of those of our agents, customers, members, and others including to enforce our agreements, policies and terms of use or (iii) in an emergency to protect the personal safety of our employees, customers, or any person.

We may also provide aggregate statistics and deidentified data about our customers, including traffic patterns and related site information, to reputable third parties for their own purposes, including statistical analysis.

The Websites may include personal profiles, discussion forums, blogs, social networking services or other interactive areas (“Interactive Areas”) in which you or third parties may create, post or store content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the Websites. If you use these Interactive Areas, you should be aware that any personal information you post on the Websites or provide to others through the Websites may be read, collected and used by others and may be posted on publicly available portions of the Websites. Such information may be retained indefinitely, and may be saved by caching services on the Internet. We recommend you be cautious in giving out personal information to others in public or private online forums. We are not responsible for personal information you chose to post in Interactive Areas of the Websites or the use by third parties of such personal information.

We are not responsible for the actions of Service Providers or other third parties, nor are we responsible for any additional information you provide directly to Service Providers or other third parties and we encourage you to become familiar with their practices before disclosing information directly to them.
