# RP privacy policy

At Reiman Publications, we respect you and your choice to do business with us, both on-line and off. That’s why we’ve taken extra care to thoroughly explain what you can expect from us.

As a company, we strive to provide our customers with quality magazines, books and merchandise. We are also committed to exceptional service, which includes maintaining your privacy and any information that you provide to us.

The following statement details our privacy policy in three parts:

  * How and what information is collected 

  * How Reiman Publications uses customer information 

  * What customers can do to retain their privacy  





We urge you to carefully review this statement.

**  
Gathering information**

Every time you visit the Reiman Publications Web site, our server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your e-mail address. This means our server can identify “where” you’re from, but not “who” you are.

General information is collected on what pages you access or visit.

Reiman Publications also retains any customer information volunteered, such as an e-mail address you might supply in a letter or while placing an order, as well as survey information and/or site registrations.

 **Important:** No personally identifiable information can be retrieved or captured by our Web site server unless you volunteer it.

**  
Building a better business for you**

The information we collect is used to improve the content of our Web site, making it easier for you to enjoy your time on-line with us.

If you supply us with your postal address or e-mail address, you may receive periodic mailings from us about new products, services or upcoming events. Likewise, if you provide us with your telephone number, we may contact you by telephone regarding your on-line order.

From time to time, your postal address or e-mail address may be made available to other reputable companies that we think may have a product or service you’d be interested in. However, you have the right to request that your name, postal address or e-mail address not be shared with any other business.

It is our policy NOT to allow disclosure of your telephone number to outside individuals or companies for the sale of products not produced by Reiman Publications. 

**Maintaining your personal privacy**

If you do not wish to receive mailings or telephone calls from Reiman Publications, or if you wish to request that your name not be shared with other reputable companies, simply let us know by e-mailing [subscriberservices@reimanpub.com](mailto:subscriberservices@reimanpub.com) or by calling toll-free, 1-800/344-6913.

Correspondence can also be mailed to the attention of Subscriber Services at the following address:

Reiman Publications  
5400 South 60th Street  
Greendale WI 53129

All requests to be removed from telephone or mailing lists will be honored promptly. However, please note that there may be circumstances where your request overlaps current mailings. We apologize for any temporary inconvenience this may cause.

Any questions regarding this privacy policy may be directed to Subscriber Services by mail at the above address, by calling 1-800/344-6913 or by e-mailing [subscriberservices@reimanpub.com](mailto:subscriberservices@reimanpub.com).

About Your On-line Security...**

Every on-line purchase you make with Reiman Publications is 100% safe. That’s because our server uses the best software available (Secure Sockets Layer protocol) for secure Internet transactions. When you place an on-line order, your information, such as a credit card number, is encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. This means that any information you send to Reiman Publications via the Internet is unreadable in transit. That makes ordering on-line through a secure connection one of the safest ways to shop!
