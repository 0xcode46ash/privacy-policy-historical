**Privacy Policy** ****

BirthdayPartyIdeas.com is very concerned with protecting our reader's online privacy. 

Although our server can collect IP addresses, we only do so to understand the traffic patterns of our site.  Our traffic pattern analysis allows us to make better site improvements.  Individuals are not identified by our server.

BirthdayPartyIdeas.com does collect personal data that is voluntarily submitted by our readers when submitting a party idea.  Most reader submissions are limited to an e-mail address, first name and general location (usually city, state & country). Readers who have won awards submit additional information so that the award can be delivered to the reader. 

Reader ideas that are included in the BirthdayPartyIdeas.com site are accompanied with the reader's first name and general location (usually city, state & country).

We currently do not publish a newsletter or distribute e-mail advertisements.  Readers who have submitted ideas do not receive follow-up correspondence unless they win an award, ask a question of our team, or our team has a question for the reader, etc.

BirthdayPartyIdeas.com is committed to ensuring the security of reader information maintained by BirthdayPartyIdeas.com, therefore, access is extremely limited.
