# bimmerfest Privacy Policy

  


###  You are visiting a performanceIX site 

Protecting your privacy is important to us. We strive to keep your personal information confidential. By ensuring that you are aware of and understand the performanceIX Privacy Policy, we can provide you with better service. Please take a moment to read the following policy to learn how we handle your personal information. 

###  Information we gather 

When you visit a performanceIX website, you are being watched, studied and in some cases even probed. However, we only gather typical non-personal information about you so relax and enjoy it. 

We gather things like: 

> **Ø** Operating System  
>  **Ø** Browser type  
>  **Ø** Connection Speed  
>  **Ø** Computer speed and size (it does matter)  
>  **Ø** Your zodiac sign  
>  **Ø** Monitor resolution  
>  **Ø **IP settings 

###  Cookies 

Sometimes we use cookies (white chocolate macadamia nut if you were curious), which we feel better enable the site and make it more user friendly. Should you decide to disable or reject our freshly baked goodies, some services may not function as we had intended. But you probably knew that would happen since like the whole Internet uses them. 

###  What we do with your information 

The information we gather is used in brainstorming sessions to help us make better decisions regarding the performance of our site. **WE NEVER SELL, LEASE, or RENT ANY INFORMATION WE GATHER TO THIRD PARTIES AND FOR THAT MATTER FIRST AND SECOND PARTIES. INSTEAD WE GIVE YOUR INFORMATION AWAY TO ANYONE THAT WANTS IT TO HELP PROMOTE THE FUTURE OF SPAM.** (Just kidding). 

###  Gratuitous Sensitive Appeal 

We are Internet users ourselves; in fact, you might go so far as to say we love the Internet. And unless some certified legal action is all up in our face, we will not reveal any information we know about our you or any members nor we will use your information for any ill intent. That's just not cool. 

###  On a serious note 

This is not a legally binding document. This is us, performanceIX, letting you know how we truly feel about your privacy online. If you have no sense of humor, please read [this version](https://web.archive.org/web/20051212153714id_/http%3A//www.bimmerfest.com/privacy_serious.php), which essentially says the same thing only without the hilarious wit.
