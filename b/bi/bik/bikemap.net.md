# Our Privacy Policy - Bikemap - Your bike routes online

**Summary:** We store your data only as far as it is needed to provide you good services and we try to be very transparent about how we do that. Your data is safe with us. 

## Which data do we collect?

We use technologies like cookies (small files stored by your browser) to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your browser, operating system and IP address.

We also may collect personally identifiable information that you provide to us, such as your name or email address. If authorized by you, we may also access profile and other information from services like Facebook.

Our systems are not designed to associate personal information with your activities (such as pages you view or things you click on or search for).

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.

In serving you, we may use or store your precise geographic location, if you give us permission to do so. We do not use or share this data for any other purpose. Many devices will indicate through an icon when location services are operating. We only share this location information with others as approved by you.

In addition to our own services we also use [Google Analytics](http://analytics.google.com/) for statistics. They may access anonymous data (such as your IP address or device ID) to help us understand how our services are used. They use this data solely on our behalf. They do not share it except in aggregate form; no data is shared as to any individual user. See their privacy policy [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

## How can you access or delete your data?

You can sign into your account to see or delete any personally identifiable information we have stored, such as your name, address, email or phone number. You can also contact us by email to request to see or delete this information.

We remove personally identifiable information (such as your name or email address) and other preferences associated with your account after a security period of two months after you delete your account. We may retain other data indefinitely.

## Are your personal identifiable data shared with other companies?

No.

## Is ad tracking used?

Ad companies such as Google Adsense ([Privacy policy](http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads/)) or Discover Outdoor ([Privacy policy](http://www.discover-outdoor.com/de/info-service/datenschutz.php)) may use and collect **anonymous** data about your interests to customize content and advertising here and in other sites and applications. Interest and location data may be linked to your device, but is not linked to your identity. 

## Is your data safe?

We take reasonable steps to secure your personally identifiable information against unauthorized access or disclosure. We encrypt transmission of data on pages where you provide payment information. However, no security or encryption method can be guaranteed to protect information from hackers or human error.

Information we collect may be stored or processed on computers located in any country where we do business.

## What happens with your data under special circumstances?

To operate the service, we also may make identifiable and anonymous information available to third parties in these limited circumstances: (1) with your express consent, (2) when we have a good faith belief it is required by law, (3) when we have a good faith belief it is necessary to protect our rights or property, or (4) to any successor or purchaser in a merger, acquisition, liquidation, dissolution or sale of assets. Your consent will not be required for disclosure in these cases, but we will attempt to notify you, to the extent permitted by law to do so.
