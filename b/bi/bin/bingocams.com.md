Privacy Conditions 

You can rest assured that your details and transactions will be treated with complete confidentiality by Bingocams. As a token of our commitment to the privacy of our players, we have compiled the following guidelines for our Bingocams website and all related activities. 

Gathering of information.

We gather, control and use personal information exclusively for the purpose of providing optimal service. Most information is provided by you. Some details are automatically gathered by our system (such as your choice of game or preferred method of payment). 

Use of Information.

Information is used to protect and control your file, account or other details. Information is also used to process your transactions and to ensure compliance with legislation and regulations. Your details also help us to develop new services and improve existing ones so that we can keep providing you with quality products and services. In addition, your information enables us to contact you and inform you about our software, services and/or website. 

Confidentiality of Information.

We do not exchange any personal details. All card payments take place on a securely hosted page provided by Paypoint. All transactions are conducted in accordance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. Your personal details and account information will never be divulged to third parties. 

Non-personal Information.

We may use non-personal, non-specific information to create player activity statistics for market research or promotional purposes. This can involve transaction patterns, payouts and betting trends. Personal identifying information will not be used without the consent of the player. 

Use of username and profile photo/webcam image for promotional purposes

Bingocams at all times reserves the right to publish your username when a prize is won. When you activate your webcam, you give Bingocams permission to use its images for promotional purposes. However, this only concerns your public profile and webcam image. Other personal information will never be published. 

An example of such use is the display of your profile to other players when you win a prize. 

Securing of Information.

To secure your information, we have put various measures in place. Your information is safely stored on a strictly secure network and can only be accessed by a small and select number of employees. If you need to access your personal data, you do this through a secure connection. When details are exchanged, a special coding system is used. The technology applied is regularly updated in order that we can continue guaranteeing the safety of your information and the reliability of our systems.
