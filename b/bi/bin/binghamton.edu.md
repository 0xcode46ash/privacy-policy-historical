Binghamton University Commitment to Privacy

At Binghamton University (binghamton.edu) we are committed to protecting your privacy and making it easier and more efficient for individuals and organizations to interact with us.  In developing this policy, Binghamton University adhered strictly to federal and state laws, rules and regulations, policies and procedures of the State University of New York and Binghamton University, specifically the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law. We recognize that it is critical for individuals and organizations to be confident that their privacy is protected when they visit binghamton.edu.  You can travel through most of binghamton.edu without giving us any information about yourself.  Sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request, and this commitment of privacy explains our online information practices. 

Binghamton University does not collect any _personal information_ about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending an e-mail or by voluntarily completing a data collection instrument (i.e. survey, application, request for information) available through binghamton.edu 

When visiting binghamton.edu, Binghamton University automatically collects and stores the following information about your visit:

  * The Web page from which the user accessed the current Web page
  * The date and time of the _user_ 's request
  * The pages that were visited and the amount of time spent at each page.



None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute _personal information_ by the [Internet Security and Privacy Act](http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?cl=114&a=3). The information that is collected automatically is used to improve binghamton.edu's content and to help Binghamton University understand how _users_ are interacting with its Web site. This information is collected for statistical analysis and to determine what information is of most and least interest to our _users_.  The information is not collected for commercial marketing purposes and Binghamton University is not authorized to sell or otherwise disclose the information collected from binghamton.edu for commercial marketing purposes.
