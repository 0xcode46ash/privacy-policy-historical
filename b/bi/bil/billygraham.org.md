# BGEA: About Us: Privacy Policy

**Awareness**  
BGEA provides this online privacy policy to inform you of the way your information is collected and used as well as to make you aware of our security practices. We also provide you with the opportunity to remove your name from our postal mailing list, if you desire to do so. 

**Information We Collect**  
There are three different ways in which we collect information from visitors on our Web site: 

1\. From online requests for information (i.e. [e-mail newsletters](https://web.archive.org/elist.asp), [contact forms](https://web.archive.org/Contact_BGEA.asp), etc.); 2\. From online requests for materials from our organization (i.e. [requesting a free offer](https://secure.billygraham.org/freeoffer.asp), or [committing your life to Christ](https://secure.billygraham.org/commitment.asp).); and 3\. From [online donations](https://secure.billygraham.org/donate.asp)

The information we collect online includes name, address, city, state, ZIP/postal code, telephone number, e-mail address, and, in the case of [online donations](https://secure.billygraham.org/donate.asp) or [online shopping](http://www.grason.org/), credit card number and expiration date. In order to continuously improve our service to you and tailor our future communications to you, we may also ask you to provide us with information regarding your demographics, comments, professional interests, and contact preferences. 

**How the Information is Used**  
BGEA uses your information to understand your needs and provide you with better online service. We may use your information to complete a transaction, issue you an income tax receipt for a donation, or to personalize our Web site for you. If you so desire, we may also use this information to update you on ministry projects and activities. Credit card numbers are used only for donation or payment processing and are not retained for any other purposes. We also provide you the opportunity to remove your name from our postal mailing list, if you desire to do so. Please review the corresponding section of this privacy policy below. 

In addition, BGEA will not send you e-mail that you have not agreed to receive. We may periodically send you e-mail announcing news and event information. If you choose to supply your postal address in an online form, you may receive mailings from us as well. 

**No Sharing of Personal Information**  
BGEA never sells, rents, leases or exchanges your personal information with other organizations. BGEA assures you that the identity of all who contact us through this Web site will be kept confidential. BGEA may occasionally send mailings on behalf of other organizations or ministries when their interests align with BGEA. Use of your personal information will be limited to further the ministry activities of BGEA and partner ministries. 

****Canadian Residents**  
**The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association of Canada (BGEAC) retains your personal information as confidential.

BGEA is committed to ensuring the security of your personal information.
