# Bills.com Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 15, 2006.

Bills.com recognizes your expectation of privacy and security, and we greatly respect your privacy concerns.  Your security and the security of your personal information is a top priority for Bills.com.  This privacy policy applies to the information you submit on the [www.bills.com](http://www.bills.com/) website, and outlines how we gather information and how bills.com maintains your private data to ensure our goal of satisfied and trusted users.  This Privacy Policy does not apply to websites maintained by other partners or companies that we link to or that we work with – for information on other partners’ policies, please refer to their own privacy policies.  If you have questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy, you contact Bills.com at customercare@bills.com.

By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine® Reliability Program, we have made a commitment to meet the program's strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have our practices approved by BBBOnLine. 

**Information Collection**  
In order to operate the Bills.com service and to provide to you the valuable services that you request through this website, Bills.com, Inc. ("Bills.com" or "we") must ask you to provide us information about yourself. 

**Information Sharing, Use and Disclosure**  
If you apply for any services offered through the Bills.com Web site that are provided or fulfilled by third parties, those third parties will have their own privacy policies governing the use of the information that you have requested for Bills.com to provide or transfer to them.  You authorize Bills.com to exchange the information you provide in the application forms with the third party service providers.  These third-parties are prohibited form using this information for any other purposes, including marketing other offers directly to you.   
We do not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide product or services you have requested or under the following circumstances:

**Products or Service Requests  
** If you submit a request for a product or service such as debt consolidation, debt management, mortgage, bill pay, loans, credit products, insurance or other services we may offer, we will share the personal information contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number and email address with our business partners to process and fulfill your request. Our business partners may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of our partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that partner not to contact you again.   
**  
As Permitted by Law -** We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Bills.com's 

_Terms of Use_

, or as otherwise required by law.

**Business Transfer -** As with any other business, it is possible that Bills.com in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Bills.com, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy Policy unless you consent otherwise.   
**  
Framing & Masking**   
Bills.com frames and masks certain business partners’ urls, to help you more easily return to Bills.com’s site.  One way we do this is when Bills.com directs you to the website of a recommended business partner – for example, when you want to apply for a health insurance quote through our business partner eHealthInsurance.com –  Bills.com will take you to their page to complete the application.   In this scenario,  the information these providers request and make available is presented in a “framed" format, where Bills.com’s  border will surround the pages served by the service provider.  Another way we do this - for example – is when you request our Bill Pay service, you will be directed to to a page where Bills.com’s branding is framing the site and masking the url  which gives the user the look and feel of Bills.com’s site, when they are actually on [www.ehealthinsurance.com](http://www.ehealthinsurance.com/) or other business partner site.  This helps the user to easily return to Bills.com’s site.  In either scenario, the trusted service provider is prominently identified  and you will be told in the header that a third party is collecting your data and their privacy policy governs this colletion and use.  Please be aware that any information you provide on these framed or masked pages is provided directly to those service providers and is subject to their security and privacy policies. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of these outside service providers’ sites,  because their privacy practices may differ from ours 

 The information transmitted to third parties or business parties may include your name, telephone number, street address, email address and information that you provide about your specific financial situation.  
**  
Advertisements & Pop Up Windows**  
On occasion, you may receive advertisements for Bills.com from third parties. For instance, when visiting a third party website, you may receive a "pop up" window advertising Bills.com. Please note that such advertisements are served by the third party website that you have visited and are not controlled by Bills.com. In addition, such advertisements may be placed by third party ad servers or ad networks. We maintain relationships with a number of the third party ad networks currently operating.   
**  
Anti-Spam Policy**  
You will not receive Bills.com email communications unless you submit your email address to us and register to receive them. Additionally, you may also receive emails that advertise Bills.com's services from third party publishers. We have established firm ground rules for dealing with any third party email services to ensure that advertisements for Bills.com are not sent out through a "Spam" mailing -- ensuring that our offers are sent only to those individuals who have given their permission to the third party email service to receive email communications. If any third party email publisher refuses to abide by Bills.com's anti-Spam policy, we will not use that publisher's services. If you want to stop receiving emails from a third party, you should follow the opt-out instructions included in the third party email so that you will not be included in any future mailings. An "unsubscribe" link should appear within or at the top or bottom of the email you received. However if for any reason it does not work, please bring that to our attention by emailing us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com).  
**  
Testimonials**   
If you submit a testimonial to us, we will ask for your permission to post your testimonial prior to posting on the Web site. We will post your first name and last initial.  We may post a photo of you or use a stock photo.  Please be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit as a testimonial to be posted can be read, collected, or used by the general public, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit to us as a testimonial.  If you would like to your testimonial removed at any time, please contact us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com). 

**Log Files**  
As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files.  This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data.  We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole.  We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.  IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help us remember your information during your visit to the Bills.com Web site.  We use an internal program that uses log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors (what pages were visited, for how long and in what order) to our site in the aggregate to assist us in analyzing user behavior and to improve the layout of the website to make it easier to use.  
**  
Web Beacons**  
We employ a software technology called Web Beacons, that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective.  Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information in order to track 1) which website the customer came from and 2) which form the customer may have completed.  This tracking helps us to improve the website for the benefit of future website visitors. 

**Cookies and IP Addresses**  
To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. "Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a Bills.com customer if you return to the Bills.com site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you log in to your Bills.com account by entering your e-mail address and password. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your password multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site.  We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Links.”

 **Third Party Advertisers  
**We allow some of our business partners to use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, allowing them to track a successful completion of a form when a user visits this site. The information collected through this technology is not personally identifiable.  
**  
Confidentiality and Security**  
The security of your personal information is very important at Bills.com and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example: 

**Opting-Out**  
If you do not want us to share your information with our partners, do not submit your information on the loan request or other forms on our Web site. Information submitted on our site is shared with our trusted third parties, in order to provide you with the specific services or information that you requested.  If you no longer wish to receive communications from these third parties, please contact them directly.  Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their email communications.   
**  
Third Party Links**  
This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide to Bills.com. However, when you visit websites to which Bills.com provides a link, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own privacy and security policy. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's privacy policy. A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any other service provider from whom you request services.

If Bills.com receives personal information from a third party that is not in conjunction with a service offered on our site, the use and disclosure of such information is governed by the agreement (if any) between Bills.com and such third party.   
**  
A Special Note about Children's Privacy**
