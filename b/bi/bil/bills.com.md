**Information Collection**

In order to operate the Bills.com services and to provide to you the valuable services that you request through these websites, Bills.com, LLC. ("Bills.com" or "we") must ask you to provide us with information about yourself.

The information we collect may be from the following sources: 

  * Information provided by you in connection with obtaining financial products or services that you have requested; this may include, but not limited to, the following: full name, address, city, state, zip code, work phone, home phone, email address, home type, current home value, loan amount requested, 1st mortgage balance, rate and payment, estimated credit rating, employment status, yearly income and bankruptcy history.
  * Information you provide us when you register (such as your email address).
  * On www.bills.com only - Information, including your email address, when you ask a question in the “Ask Bill” section of the website (so that we can respond and post our answer to your question).



**Information Sharing, Use and Disclosure**

If you apply for any services offered through the Bills.com Web sites that are provided or fulfilled by third parties, those third parties will have their own privacy policies governing the use of the information that you have requested for Bills.com to provide or transfer to them. You authorize Bills.com to exchange the information you provide in the application forms with the third party service providers. These third-parties are prohibited from using this information for any other purposes, including marketing other offers directly to you.

When you register on our sites you will have the opportunity to opt to receive special offers from trusted third parties. If your preferences should change, please contact us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com).

We do not share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies who are not agents or service providers except to provide products or services you have requested or under the following circumstances: 

  * **Products or Service Requests on www.bills.com** \- If you submit a request for a product or service on our site we will share the personal information contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number and email address with our service providers to process and fulfill your request. For example, when you go to the Mortgage/refinance services pages at https://www.bills.com/mortgage/mortgage_refinance2/, the information that you submit will be shared with our service providers to provide you with a refinance quote. Our service providers will contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of our service providers contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that service provider with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that service provider not to contact you again.
  * **Products or Service Requests on www.theeasyloansite.com** \- If you submit a request for a product or service such as home refinance, cash-out refinance, home equity, and home purchase loans, we will share the personal information contained in your request form such as your full name, telephone number and email address with our business partners to process and fulfill your request. Our business partners may contact you by telephone, email, or mail based on the information you provided to us, even if you have opted into the National Do Not Call List administered by the Federal Trade Commission, any state equivalent Do Not Call List, or the Do Not Call List of an internal company. If one of our partners contacts you by telephone and you wish not to be contacted again by that business partner with respect to your inquiry, then you should specifically make a request to that partner not to contact you again.
  * **As Permitted by Law** \- We may be required to share your personal information with law enforcement or government agencies in response to subpoenas, court orders, federal/state audits or similar circumstances. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Bills.com's Terms of Use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * **Business Transfer** \- As with any other business, it is possible that Bills.com in the future could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by Bills.com, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this privacy Policy unless you consent otherwise.



**Advertisements & Pop Up Windows**

On occasion, you may receive advertisements for Bills.com from third parties. For instance, when visiting a third party website, you may receive a "pop up" window advertising Bills.com. Please note that such advertisements are served by the third party website that you have visited and are not controlled by Bills.com. In addition, such advertisements may be placed by third party ad servers or ad networks. We maintain relationships with a number of the third party ad networks currently operating.

**Newsletter**

You may sign up to receive our newsletter that is sent via email on the home page and also on various pages on the site. If you decide you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may unsubscribe using the “unsubscribe” link on each email. If you have any problems, please contact us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com) or [customercare@theeasyloansite.com](mailto:customercare@theeasyloansite.com).

**Anti-Spam Policy**

You will not receive Bills.com email communications unless you submit your email address to us or register to receive them (see “Newsletter”). Additionally, you may also receive emails that advertise Bills.com's services from third party publishers. We have established firm ground rules for dealing with any third party email services to ensure that advertisements for Bills.com are not sent out through a "Spam" mailing -- ensuring that our offers are sent only to those individuals who have given their permission to the third party email service to receive email communications. If any third party email publisher refuses to abide by Bills.com's anti-Spam policy, we will not use that publisher's services. If you want to stop receiving emails from a third party, you should follow the opt-out instructions included in the third party email so that you will not be included in any future mailings. An "unsubscribe" link should appear within or at the top or bottom of the email you received. However if for any reason it does not work, please bring that to our attention by emailing us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com) or [customercare@theeasyloansite.com](mailto:customercare@theeasyloansite.com).

**Testimonials**

If you submit a testimonial to us, we will ask for your permission to post your testimonial prior to posting on the Web site. We will post your name as given to us in your testimonial. We may post a photo of you or use a stock photo. Please be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit as a testimonial to be posted can be read, collected, or used by the general public, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit to us as a testimonial. If you would like to your testimonial removed at any time, please contact us at [customercare@bills.com](mailto:customercare@bills.com) or [customercare@theeasyloansite.com](mailto:customercare@theeasyloansite.com).

**Log Files**

As is true of most Web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information. IP addresses are tied to personally identifiable information to help us remember your information during your visit to the Bills.com Web sites. We use an internal program that uses log files to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors (what pages were visited, for how long and in what order) to our site in the aggregate to assist us in analyzing user behavior and to improve the layout of the website to make it easier to use.

**Tracking and Web Beacons**

We utilize session variables to 1) help us manage our online advertising efforts by tracking where consumers come from and 2) remember what forms a consumer has already completed so that they won’t need to complete the same form twice. The session variables are attached to each user who begins to complete one of our forms (session variables are not attached to a site visitor who does not initiate a form) and let us know whether or not a consumer has completed a form on our site; these completions or non-completions are then attributed to our various advertising campaigns, which then tell us whether or not these campaigns are successful. The variables are stored along with a consumer’s personally identifiable information, and are used solely for the purposes outlined above. The variables expire when either, the customer leaves the site, or after twenty minutes, whichever comes first. We allow some of our business partners to use cookies and clear GIFs on this site, allowing them to track a successful completion of a form when a user visits this site. The information collected through this technology is not personally identifiable. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence.

**Cookies and IP Addresses**

To serve you faster and with better quality, we use "cookies" technology. "Cookies" are small files of data that reside on your computer and allow us to recognize you as a Bills.com customer if you return to the Bills.com site using the same computer and browser. We send a "session cookie" to your computer if and when you enter personal information on the Bills.com site. These cookies allow us to recognize you if you visit multiple pages in our site during the same session, so that you don't need to re-enter your personal information multiple times. Once you log out or close your browser, these session cookies expire and no longer have any effect. Cookies are not tied to personally identifiable information. Some of our business partners (e.g., advertisers) use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. See “Third Party Links.”

**Confidentiality and Security**

The security of your personal information is very important at Bills.com and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. For example: 

  * We limit access to personal information to those employees or agents who assist us in providing requested products and services to you. Employees are required to comply with our strict policies and procedures regarding the handling of your personal information. Employees who violate these policies are subject to our normal disciplinary process.
  * We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard personal information about you.
  * We use industry standard data encryption technologies when transferring and receiving consumer data on the Bills.com website.
  * We have partnered with VeriSign to protect against the loss, misuse or alteration of information that we collect from you.



**Opting-Out**

If you do not want us to share your information with our partners, do not submit your information on the loan request or other forms on our Web site. Information submitted on our site is shared with our trusted third parties, in order to provide you with the specific services or information that you requested. If you no longer wish to receive communications from these third parties, please contact them directly. Third party advertisers that maintain their own mailing lists may send communications that advertise our services, and you may need to contact these parties directly in order to stop receiving their email communications. You may not opt-out from receiving critical services update emails. If have signed up to receive our newsletter, you may unsubscribe by clicking on the link within each email sent to you.

**Third Party Links**

This Privacy Policy applies to all information that you provide to Bills.com. However, when you visit websites to which Bills.com provides a link, keep in mind you will be interacting with a third party that operates under its own terms and conditions and/or privacy policies. If you choose to obtain certain services through a third party site, the data collected by the third party is governed by that third party's terms and conditions and/or privacy policy. On www.bills.com only - A third party site will also have its own policy regarding the use of cookies and clear gifs. We encourage you to review the terms and conditions and privacy policies of third parties from whom you request services and share personally identifiable information...
