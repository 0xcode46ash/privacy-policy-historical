**Routine information collection**

All web servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to the site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and helps us to understand which pages and information are useful and helpful to our visitors and customers.

PRIVACY

**

Your privacy, security and confidentiality are very important to us. Collection of your data is done solely to understand better what our customers require, so that we may provide the best service suited to you the customer. We may from time to time contact you with offers or information, this would be via SMS, Phone or Email, however you will always be given the option to no longer recieve such information if you wish to do so. It is important to realise that we do not hold any credit card information at any time - all debit/credit card transactions are done via a secure card processor, (we currently use PayPal, Worldpay and Ukash) each of which will process data on a secure server and safe environment. If you call us to place an order over the telephone, your information is entered into a secure online payment environment powered by Worldpay, in this instance your card details ,although provided to a member of our staff, are never recorded in anyway and are used solely for that one order and entered directly into the payment processor. You will be provided with a Transaction ID from this purchase. With this in mind we will not accept any orders that have come via email with credit card details provided. Sending your debit/credit card details via email is not always secure so best practive suggests you refrain from doing this.

COOKIES

**

Cookies are small pieces of information used to gather information on the user of the site for various purposes, many people think of them being used to serve advertising, however most are used to actually make the shopping cart work! Without them we would not get the information required to process your order, whether this be adding items to the shopping cart or using the checkout. (1st Party Cookies) 

The use of '1st party cookies' on our website is limited and are only there to enable the shopping cart to operate and recognise you as a shopper and what is or has been in your basket. These are as follows:

 PHPSESSID

(Contains a PHP "session ID", expires when the browser is closed)

session

(Contains a PHP "session ID", can also contain an email address and encrypted password, expires after one year)

The "PHPSESSID" cookie is required so that the site can recognise the same user clicking from page to page. Without it, every page would be treated as the first visit to the site, and anything added to the shopping basket would be instantly forgotten. Online shopping would, therefore, be impossible.  


The "session" cookie is intended for the user's convenience, the site creates this with a copy of the initial session ID so that they can be classed as "returning" and the contents of their shopping basket will still be available. If the user signs in with an email address and password, these login details are are also saved so that they can remain logged in when returning (the password is encrypted). If the user signs out, their login details are removed from the cookie.

**3rd party cookies**  are created outside of our control, again to track movement from one site to another - an example would be Facebook and Twitter - without these you would not be able to "like" or "unlike" products amongst other things.   


In addition BilliardsBoutique.com makes use of Google Analytics, this enable us to see what pages you use so we can make the site more useful for the visitor. Google Analytics creates 3rd party cookies in order to provide reports about the site visitors. This is being done for statistic tracking, and Google Analytics cookies do not collect personal data about the website visitors (For example, it will tell us that so and so visitors from the UK visited our site yesterday, but not who they were individually). [See how Google Analytics uses Cookies](http://www.google.co.uk/policies/privacy/ads/#toc-analytics). 

3rd party cookies can be limited and controlled through your own web browser settings.

It is important to note that you can change your browser settings to disable cookies if you have privacy concerns. Disabling cookies for all sites is not recommended as it may interfere with your use of certain websites and the functionality of those websites. It is suggested that if you do have privacy concerns regarding cookies that you disable or enable cookies on a per-site basis. Consult your browser documentation for instructions on how to block cookies and other tracking mechanisms.
