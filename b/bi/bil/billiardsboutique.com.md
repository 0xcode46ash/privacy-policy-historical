[](https://web.archive.org/)

### **Privacy Policy & Cookies **

This privacy policy sets out how [Billiards Boutique](http://www.billiardsboutique.com/) uses and protects any information that you provide when you use this website.

Billiards Boutique is committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected. Should we ask you to provide certain information by which you can be identified when using this website, then you can be assured that it will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

Billiards Boutique may change this policy periodically by updating this page. You should check this page from time to time to ensure that you are happy with any changes.

### Routine information collection

All Internet servers track basic information about their visitors. This information includes, but is not limited to, IP addresses, browser details, timestamps and referring pages. None of this information can personally identify specific visitors to the site. The information is tracked for routine administration and maintenance purposes, and helps us to understand which pages and information are useful and helpful to our visitors and customers.

### Privacy

Your privacy, security and confidentiality are very important to us. Collection of your data is done solely to understand better what our customers require, so that we may provide the best service suited to you the customer on an as-needed basis. We may periodically contact you with offers or information and competitions that might be of interest to you, this would be via SMS, phone, post or email, you always have the option of opting out of this marketing activity if you wish to do so.

As Internet shoppers ourselves we know how important it is to be clear on how your information is used, any information we have collected has been entered by you as a shopper on this website and will never be given, sold or rented to any 3rd party. You are our customer and that is the the thing that is most important to us. 

It is also of great importance to your piece of mind to realise that we do not hold any credit card information at any time - all debit/credit card transactions are done via a secure card processor, (we currently use V12 Finance, PayPal and Shopify Payments) each of which will process data on a secure server and safe environment.

If you call us to place an order over the telephone, your information is entered into a secure online payment environment powered by PayPal, in this instance your card details, although provided to a member of our staff, are never physically recorded or stored in any way and are used solely for that one order and entered directly into the payment processor whilst you are on the phone. You will be provided with a Transaction ID from this purchase which will be the ID from your own bank or card issuer.

Please bear in mind that we will not accept any orders with credit/debit card details sent via email, this is not secure and for your own safety it is heavily advised that you do not do this.

### Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of information used to gather information on the user of the website for various purposes, many people think of them being used to serve advertising, however, most are used to actually make the shopping cart work! Without them we would not get the information required to process your order, whether this be adding items to the shopping cart or using the checkout.

1st Party Cookies - The use of '1st party cookies' on our website is limited and are only there to enable the shopping cart to operate and recognise you as a shopper and what is or has been in your basket. These are as follows:

PHPSESSID (Contains a PHP "session ID", expires when the browser is closed)

session (Contains a PHP "session ID", can also contain an email address and encrypted password, expires after one year)

The "PHPSESSID" cookie is required so that the site can recognise the same user clicking from page to page. Without it, every page would be treated as the first visit to the site, and anything added to the shopping basket would be instantly forgotten. Online shopping would, therefore, be impossible. The "session" cookie is intended for the user's convenience, the site creates this with a copy of the initial session ID so that they can be classed as "returning" and the contents of their shopping basket will still be available. If the user signs in with an email address and password, these login details are also saved so that they can remain logged in when returning (the password is encrypted). If the user signs out, their login details are removed from the cookie.

3rd party cookies are created outside of our control, again to track movement from one site to another - an example would be Facebook and Twitter - without these you would not be able to "like" or "unlike" products amongst other things.  In addition Billiards Boutique makes use of Google Analytics, this enable us to see what pages you use so we can make the site more useful for you and to see which products are most popular. Google Analytics creates 3rd party cookies in order to provide reports about the site visitors. This is being done for statistic tracking, and Google Analytics cookies do not collect personal data about the website visitors (For example, it will tell us that _X_ number of visitors from the UK visited our site yesterday, but not who they were individually). [See how Google Analytics uses Cookies](http://www.google.co.uk/policies/technologies/cookies/). 3rd party cookies can be limited and controlled through your own web browser settings.
