**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

**The Information We Collect:**

This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on this website. At present, the only information that we gather regarding our users is the name, email address and telephone numbers of users who voluntarily provide this information to us. Users who elect to contact us may give us their names, email addresses and other information.

**The Way We Use Information:**

We may use the information you provide about yourself to provide you with information about the site and about BITMOJI’s other projects, to manage your account, to provide you with information regarding products, services, sweepstakes, contests and promotions available through the website and to respond to your inquiries. If you wish to stop receiving emails from us, you may opt out of receiving further emails at the email address that you have provided to us by replying to any email that we send to you with the word “remove” in the subject line.

From time to time we may engage in co-promotions with third parties in connection with the website and/or in connection with BITMOJI’s and its partners’ other projects. In these cases, if you have not opted out from receiving emails from us, your contact information may be provided to the third party with which we are engaging in the co-promotion.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We may use cookies only for the purpose of storing session information. No personal information is saved by us in a cookie.

**Links**

We may include links on our site to third party websites which we do not control and which are not covered by this privacy policy. When you access third party sites through links on our site, you should review the privacy policies of those sites in order to learn what personal information may be collected and how it may be used.

**Log Files**

Like most standard website servers we use log files. The information collected in log files may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks. We do not currently run reports to analyze this data, but we reserve the right to do so in the future to analyze trends, administer the site, track user’s movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Neither IP addresses nor other information collected in the log files are linked to personally identifiable information.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

**Our Commitment To Children’s Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13 years of age, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 13.

**Business Transitions**

In the event our site goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users’ information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via notice on our site prior to a change of ownership or control of their information. If as a result of the business transition, the users’ personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

You can access all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by contacting us at the email address provided below. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information.

You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows error. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

**How To Contact Us**

Should you have other questions or concerns about these privacy policies, please send us an email at privacy@bitmoji.ch

This privacy policy may be modified by us from time to time by posting new versions of the policy at our website. Since we do not undertake to notify you of changes in the policy you should review our privacy policy from time to time to ensure that it continues to be consistent with your needs. Your continued use of our site signifies your acceptance of this privacy policy as it may be changed from time to time.
