# Privacy Policy | Bitwarden

_Your privacy is critically important to us. At Bitwarden we have a few fundamental principles:_

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. 
  * We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services. 



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:

If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact/). 

Bitwarden operates several websites including bitwarden.com. It is Bitwarden's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites. 

### Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Bitwarden collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bitwarden's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bitwarden's visitors use its website. From time to time, Bitwarden may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. 

Bitwarden also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Bitwarden does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. 

### Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Bitwarden's websites choose to interact with Bitwarden in ways that require Bitwarden to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Bitwarden gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account at bitwarden.com to provide and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Bitwarden are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Bitwarden collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Bitwarden. Bitwarden does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

### Use of personal data

Bitwarden may collect aggregated statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Bitwarden may monitor the most popular user accounts on the platform. Bitwarden may display this information publicly or provide it to others. In addition, Bitwarden may use your behavioral data and other data you provide to Bitwarden to customize internal advertisements on its platform to its users (for example, to offer you a premium membership). However, Bitwarden does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. 

### Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Bitwarden discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Bitwarden's behalf or to provide services available at Bitwarden's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Bitwarden's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Bitwarden will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Bitwarden discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when Bitwarden believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Bitwarden, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Bitwarden website and have supplied your email address, Bitwarden may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Bitwarden and our products. We expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Bitwarden takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Bitwarden uses cookies to help Bitwarden identify and track visitors, their usage of Bitwarden website, and their website access preferences. Bitwarden visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Bitwarden's websites, with the drawback that certain features of Bitwarden's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

### Business Transfers

If Bitwarden, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Bitwarden goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Bitwarden may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. 

### Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Bitwarden may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Bitwarden's sole discretion. Bitwarden encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
