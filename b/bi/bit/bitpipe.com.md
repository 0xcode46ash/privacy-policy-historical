# Bitpipe: Privacy Policy

**Bitpipe's Overall Philosophy**  
Bitpipe is committed to protecting our users' privacy. This statement is meant to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personally identifiable information. Bitpipe will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the law. 

**Information Collected**   
As a standard practice, Bitpipe assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. (This random number is kept in a file called a "cookie" on each user´s computer. More on cookies below.) This random number lets us keep track of how many times users are doing specific things (such as visiting our site each month) without really knowing who those users are. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. We also gather information about what users are searching for. We use all this information in order to improve our content, plan site enhancements, and measure overall site effectiveness. The overall goal of is to make the site better - and hopefully more useful - for our users. 

**Cookies**   
Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user. Unless users specifically tell us (e.g. when signing up for _KnowledgeAlert_ ), Bitpipe will not know who users are, even though we assign a cookie to users´ computers. Users can set their browsers to notify them when they receive a cookie, giving them the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, note that by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly, or users may not be permitted to access certain information.) 

**Sharing Information**   
We provide summary reports to the companies that put information into our database. An example of the type of information included in a summary report is "5,000 people looked at your information this week, and 25% of those people clicked through to read the full report." Our clients who put content into our database need this information to determine the effectiveness of their content. We don´t tell the content providers details about who saw their data or clicked through to their reports unless our users have specifically told us this doing so is acceptable. 

Bitpipe discloses aggregated user statistics (e.g., "25% of our users are interested in Networking") in order to describe our services to prospective partners, to other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**Partners and Other Sites**  
Bitpipe does not control the information collection and distribution policies third-party sites, although we do encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one. 

_**KnowledgeAlert**_   
_KnowledgeAlert_ is a customizable e-mail delivery system for keeping users up to date on their areas of interest. The quality of the information and services that Bitpipe can provide depends on the accuracy and depth of information that users supply. Bitpipe uses this data to provide a customized, personalized e-mail service. A user may edit his/her _KnowledgeAlert_ Information at any time by using his/her e-mail address and password. _KnowledgeAlert_ accounts can be deleted, or individual subscriptions can be deactivated, but doing so will result in the affected users not receiving e-mails on their topics of interest. 

Summary reports of content accessed via _KnowledgeAlert_ are provided to the companies that put content in our database. We do not give these companies individual details except as noted below under " _KnowledgeAlert_ Partners." 

**_KnowledgeAlert_ Partners**  
If a user initially signs on to _KnowledgeAlert_ through a partner´s website (i.e. other than on bitpipe.com), we will share the user´s name, e-mail address, and interest in that partner´s offerings with that partner. We encourage our partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one, but ultimately they control their use of users´ information. Users should contact these partners directly if they have any questions about the partner´s use of this information. If a user subsequently signs up for other information via _KnowledgeAlert_ that is not related to the original source partner, we do not share those individual details with the original partner or anyone else. Since _KnowledgeAlert_ is customizable by users, users may opt out of (i.e. delete or make "inactive") any of their _KnowledgeAlert_ subscriptions at any time. 

_**KnowledgeAlert**_ **Password**   
_KnowledgeAlert_ account information is password-protected so that users have access to this personal information. Bitpipe recommends that users do not divulge their passwords to anyone. Bitpipe never asks for passwords in unsolicited phone calls or unsolicited e-mails. Users should sign out of their _KnowledgeAlert_ accounts and close their browsers when they have finished with a particular session. This is to ensure that others cannot access personal information (e.g. if a user shares a computer with someone else or is using a computer in a public place such as a library, airport, or Internet cafe). 

Finally, Bitpipe may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law. 

Bitpipe may modify, alter, or otherwise update this policy at any time, so Bitpipe encourage users to review this policy from time to time. 

If you have any questions about this policy, please feel free to contact us.
