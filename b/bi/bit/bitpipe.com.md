# bitpipe.com: Privacy Policy

**bitpipe's Overall Philosophy**  
bitpipe is committed to protecting our users' privacy. This statement is meant to inform our users of how we define, gather and utilize personally identifiable information. bitpipe will take reasonable steps to protect user privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the law. **Information Collected**   
As a standard practice, bitpipe assigns a random number to each user for anonymously tracking content preferences and traffic patterns. This random number lets us keep track of "how many" times folks are doing specific things - like visiting our site each month - without really knowing who those folks are. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, such as which parts of our site users are visiting and how long they spend there. We also gather information about what folks are searching for. We use all this information in order to improve our content, plan site enhancements, and measure overall site effectiveness, and therefore to make the site better and more hopefully fitting to your needs. 


**Cookies**   
This random number is kept in a file on your computer called a "cookie." Cookies, by themselves, cannot be used to determine the identity of any user: unless you specifically tell us (e.g. when you sign up for _KnowledgeAlert!_ ), bitpipe will not know who you are even though we assign a cookie to your computer. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. (However, by not accepting cookies, some of our web pages may not display properly or you may not be permitted to access certain information.) **Sharing Information**  
We provide summary reports to the companies that put information into our database. The type of information included in a summary report is "5,000 people looked at your information this week, and of those people 25% clicked through to read the full report." The folks that put content into the database need this information to determine how effective their content is. We don't tell the content companies specifically who it was that saw or clicked on their reports unless you have specifically told us this is acceptable. 

bitpipe discloses aggregated user statistics (for example, 25% of our users are interested in Networking) in order to describe our services to prospective partners, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

**Partners and Other Sites**  
bitpipe does not control the information collection and distribution policies on sites outside of bitpipe.com, although we do encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one. _**KnowledgeAlert!**_   
_KnowledgeAlert!_ is a customizable email delivery system for keeping you up to date on your areas of interest. The quality of the information and services that bitpipe can provide depends on the accuracy and depth of information that you supply. bitpipe uses this data to provide a customized, personalized email service. You may edit your _KnowledgeAlert!_ Information at any time by using your email address and password. Your _KnowledgeAlert!_ account can be deleted or individual subscriptions deactivated, but doing so will result in you not receiving emails on your topics of interest. 

Summary reports of content accessed via KnowledgeAlert are provided to the companies that put content in our database. We do not give these companies individual details except as noted below under KnowledgeAlert partners. 


**_KnowledgeAlert!_ Partners**  
If you initially sign on to _KnowledgeAlert!_ through a partner's website (ie other than on bitpipe.com) we will share your name, email address and your interest in that partner's offerings with that partner. We encourage our co-branding partners to adopt privacy policies similar to this one but ultimately they control their use of your information. You should contact these partners directly if you have any questions about their use of this information. If you subsequently sign up for other information via _KnowledgeAlert!_ that is not related to the original source partner we do not share those individual details with the original partner or anyone else. Since _KnowledgeAlert!_ is customizable by you, you may opt out of (delete or make "inactive") any of your _KnowledgeAlert!_ subscriptions at any time. _**KnowledgeAlert!**_ **Password**   
Your _KnowledgeAlert!_ Account Information is password-protected so that you and only you have access to this personal information. 

We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. bitpipe never asks for passwords in unsolicited phone calls or unsolicited emails. Remember to sign out of your _KnowledgeAlert!_ account and close your browser window when you have finished. This is to ensure that others cannot access your personal information if you share a computer with someone else, or are using a computer in a public place such as a library or Internet cafe. 

**And Finally**  
bitpipe may disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law. bitpipe may modify, alter or otherwise update this policy at any time, so we encourage you to review this policy from time to time. If you have any queries about this policy please feel free to contact our [webmaster](mailto:webmaster@bitpipe.com). Thank you for using bitpipe and _KnowledgeAlert!_ Last Updated: 11 August 1999
