# GBBG Online Privacy Policy | bitbillions | GBBG

Effective April 1, 2013. 

Global Bitbillions Group Incorporated and its affiliates and subsidiaries (“GBBG”) are committed to respecting your privacy. We’ve structured our Web sites so that, in general, you can visit GBBG on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with GBBG. 

This statement regarding the privacy of the personally identifiable information you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Accuracy, Access, Security, and Third Party Links. 

### AWARENESS

GBBG provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and from the bottom of every page on our Web site. 

What we collect. Upon logging onto our Web server, our Web server automatically recognizes your user name but not your E-mail address (where possible). We will collect the domain name from which you log on, aggregate information on what pages you access or visit, user-specific information on what pages you access or visit and information volunteered by you (such as survey information and/or site registrations). 

We do not collect your E-mail address unless you contact us by E-mail or volunteer your E-mail address and other personal information. 

GBBG websites use “cookies” to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. As you browse, we may install cookies (tiny text files stored on your hard disk by a web page server) in your browser. Cookies cannot harm your computer and they do not contain any personally identifiable information. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to store your preferences and other information on your computer in order to save you time by eliminating the need to repeatedly enter the same information and to display your personalized content on your later visits to websites. Cookies also help us to improve our site and to deliver a better and more personalized service. Among other things, they enable us: 

  * To estimate our audience size and usage pattern.
  * To store information about your preferences, and so allow us to customize our site according to your individual interests.
  * To speed up your searches.
  * To recognize you when you return to our site.



On some GBBG Web sites, you can order products or services, make requests and register to receive materials. The types of personal information that may be collected on these pages are name, customer number, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information. 

In order to tailor our subsequent communications to you and continuously improve our products and services, we may also ask you to voluntarily provide us with information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. 

How we use it. GBBG uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on services and benefits, and to personalize our Web sites for you. Credit card and bank account numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. 

From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. At a minimum, we will always give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving such direct marketing or market research contact. We will also follow local requirements, such as allowing you to opt in before receiving unsolicited contact, where applicable. Data collected online may also be combined with information you provide when you enroll with GBBG. 

Whom we share it with. GBBG will not sell, rent or lease your personally identifiable information to others unless we have your permission or are required by law. We will only share the personal data you provide online with other GBBG entities and/or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such GBBG entities and/or business partners, including those in the United States and/or any other countries, are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements. 

### CHOICE 

GBBG will not use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first letting you know and offering you a choice. As previously stated, we will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited direct marketing materials from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. Your permission is always secured first, should we ever share your information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. 

### ACCURACY & ACCESS 

GBBG strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate and secure. We do not provide access to your information online. In order to update or correct your information with GBBG it will be necessary for you to contact GBBG directly through the methods listed below. To protect your privacy and security, upon contacting us we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting you access or enabling you to make corrections. 

### SECURITY

GBBG is committed to ensuring the security of your information. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. We use the latest in encryption technology when collecting or transferring sensitive data, such as credit card and bank account information. 

International Use. Information that is submitted to GBBG’s Web Sites will be collected, processed, stored, disclosed, and disposed of in accordance with applicable U.S. law.

If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use GBBG Web sites. 

Future Developments. From time to time, we may use customer information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our privacy notice. If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will post the policy changes to our Web site to notify you of these changes and provide you with the ability to opt out of these new uses. If you are concerned about how your information is used, you should check back at our Web site periodically. We will only use data collected after a policy has changed for the new purposes.
