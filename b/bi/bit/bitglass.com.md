**How your information is protected:**

We protect the security of the personal information you provide.  Personal information we collect is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access, and we carefully protect this information from loss or misuse, and from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction in accordance with industry standards.  Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet or any wireless network can be completely secure.  Although we use commercially reasonable measures to protect the security of data transmitted to us, we cannot guarantee the security of any information transmitted to or from the Site and are not responsible for the actions of any third party that may obtain unauthorized access to that data.

**Updates to this Privacy Policy:**

We may occasionally update this Privacy Policy.  When we do, we will also revise the “last modified” date at the top of the Privacy Policy.  If the changes to the Privacy Policy are significant, we will notify you by sending a notice to the primary e-mail address specified in your account, by sending a notice to Your Administrator, or by placing a prominent notice on the Site. Modifications to this Privacy Policy may affect our use of Personal Data, Payment Data and Company Data that you provided to us prior to such modifications. The modified Privacy Policy will be effective immediately when posted to our Site.  If you do not wish to permit such changes in our use of your Personal Data, Payment Data or Company Data you must notify us immediately that you wish to deactivate your account with us.  It is your responsibility to periodically review this Privacy Policy to stay informed about how we are using and protecting the personal information we collect and what changes, if any, we have made to the Privacy Policy. Your continued access to or use of the Site, or submission to us of data and other information, constitutes your acceptance of and agreement to the modified Privacy Policy.

**Merger or acquisition:**

In the event that we merge with or into, or are acquired by, another entity or substantially all of the business or assets related to the Bitglass Site are acquired by another entity, all customer information, including Personal Data, Payment Data and Company Data that we have collected will likely be transferred to such entity.  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of us or the assets related to the Site and/or the Services may continue to process your Personal Data, Payment Data and Company Data and other information as described in this Privacy Policy, as may be modified from time to time.

**Third party links:**

In an attempt to provide you with increased value, we may include third party links on the Site. These linked sites have separate and independent privacy policies. This Privacy Policy only covers our Site and does not cover any other website.  We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content of these linked sites, the activities of their owners and operators, or the use or disclosure by them or others of any information you provide to them. Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of the Site and welcome any feedback about these linked sites (including if a specific link does not work).  We encourage you to review the privacy policies of each website that you visit.

**Voluntary sharing of information on the Site:**

You understand that when you post or transmit content or information, including Personal Data and Company Data, to publicly accessible portions of the Site (including forums, chat rooms and bulletin boards) or to other Site users, that such content or information will be made available to other parties who then may collect and use or further disclose such content or information. We have no obligation with respect to information, including Personal Data, Payment Data and Company Data, that you post to publicly accessible areas of our Site or with respect to how other parties may use or disclose information that you transmit or make available to them.

**Your ability to access and edit your Personal Data:**

You have the ability to view and edit the Personal Data that you provide to us by accessing and editing the profile under your password-protected account. We encourage you to promptly update the Personal Data previously provided to us if it changes. When updating your Personal Data, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.  We may reject requests that are overly broad or unduly burdensome or that violate the privacy of others.  In circumstances where we can provide access and editing, we will do so for free unless it would require a disproportionate effort on our part in which case we reserve the right to assess an appropriate fee to perform the request. Even though you edit your Personal Data, we may keep a copy of the prior version(s) for our archives.

**Your choices regarding our collection and retention of your Personal Data:**

You can always choose not to provide personal information, although you may be prevented from using all or portions of the Site or Services by making that choice. You can opt out of our promotional or marketing e-mails at any time by clicking the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any such promotional or marketing e-mail or by sending an e-mail indicating your desire to opt out of such future promotional or marketing e-mails to privacy@bitglass.com. You cannot opt out of administrative or transactional e-mails.  If you do not want us to use your Personal Data to allow third parties to personalize advertisements we display to you, please send an e-mail with that request to privacy@bitglass.com. You may set your browser, and/or browser add on, to block  cookies, including cookies associated with the Services, but you should be aware that our Services, or a portion thereof, may not function properly if your cookies are disabled. You may request deletion of your Personal Data by contacting us at privacy@bitglass.com, but please note that we may be required by law or otherwise to retain this information and not delete it (or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements).  Note also that if we do delete such information, you may be prevented from using any services for which that information was required and such deletion likely will be limited to removing the information from our active database, allowing us to retain the information in our archives.

**Children:**

Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.  The Site and the Services are not intended or directed to persons who are minors (typically persons under the age of 18, depending on where you live) and we do not intentionally collect Personal Data or other information from minors.  By setting up an account on the Site, a user represents to us that he or she is not a minor.  If we obtain actual knowledge that a user is a minor, we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Data from our databases.
