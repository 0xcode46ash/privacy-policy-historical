# Privacy Policy – Bitsum

We will NEVER intentionally share your email address or any other information with ANYONE, ever!

Your personal information will always be guarded to the best of our ability, and we get NO ACCESS at any point to your credit card or other billing information. That is collected on behalf of us by widely trusted sources such as PayPal and RegNow of Digital River (the top two in the industry, afaik).

We use Google Analytics for statistic collection on our web site. You can **OPT OUT** if you want to, by simply installing [this Google-provided and maintained plug-in on your browser](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout). It is compatible with IE, Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Opera. Google Analytics privacy policy is [here](http://www.google.com/intl/en/analytics/privacyoverview.html). This service simply tracks web site statistics so we can know how utilized our server is and how well we are doing at recruiting new users. Your name or other personal information we have is never transmitted to it. Only information inherently sent in a browser request is known by it. It simply collects anonymous visitor data, the same found in any web server log (e.g. 1,000 people visited today, that kind of thing).

We use Twitter, FaceBook, and Google Plus ‘Tweet’, ‘Like’, and ‘Plus’ buttons, respectively. These simply direct to the pertinent Twitter, Facebook, or Google Plus site if clicked. They have their own privacy policy, as with all external links from this site (which are easy to detect given our consistency in page formation).

We guard what limited information we do store to the best of our abilities, certainly better than most companies our size, and probably better than most large companies. We have our [Forum](http://bitsum.com/forum) isolated on a separate server and using a separate database server. Again, NONE of your billing information is stored. We store only your name, email address, address, phone, company, and license information after making a purchase. These are the bare essentials.

We do not sell or disseminate your personal information to anyone. In some cases, regional Bitsum resellers (part of the Bitsum network) may have acquired your email and have their own privacy policies. However, if you ordered through Bitsum.com, then that is not the case. At present, we send only license, Support account, or user-requested emails. We may some day offer opt-in newsletters, but only with clear and functional unsubscribe links, of course.

Our software does not monitor or report anything to Bitsum. The activation process simply sends the activation code, user name, and version information. The update process simply checks the latest available version against the current version.

Thanks,

Admin – Bitsum Technologies
