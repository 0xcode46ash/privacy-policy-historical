Our Commitment To Privacy**  
 Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.   
**  
The Information We Collect**  
This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Team National web site. The information we receive depends on what you do when you visit our site. Team National will not collect or retain any information about you personally (that is, your name, address, telephone number or e-mail address) unless you choose to provide it to us. If you visit our site to read or download information, we collect and store only the following information: the name of the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account), the date and time you access our site and the Internet address of the web site from which you linked directly to our site. We use this information to measure the number of visitors to the different sections of our site and to help us make our site more useful to visitors.   
**  
The Way We Use Information**  
We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive or if we need to contact you regarding an order you've placed. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. A Team National IMD who has an e-mail address on their personal Team National website also has a form on their contact page which you can fill out and submit to allow them to contact you. Your name, phone number and e-mail address is submitted only to the e-mail address of the IMD on whose page you completed the request form.   
**  
Our Commitment To Data Security**  
 To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. **

Our Commitment To Children's Privacy

**  
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our web site from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our web site is structured to attract anyone under 13.
