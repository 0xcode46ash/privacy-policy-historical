#### 3\. OUR INFORMATION COLLECTION PRACTICES 

**3.1 General.** When you visit the Site without creating an account, you can browse without submitting any personal information about yourself. We will, however, receive and store some non-personally-identifiable information about you. For example, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time. If you create an account, we will also collect some personally identifiable information from you, including your full name, a user name (email address) and password, and your email address. Student and teacher account holders must also submit information regarding educational institution affiliation, location, and grade level. BHP is an entity located in the United States and your personally identifiable information will be collected and stored in the United States by BHP and its third party service providers. 

**3.2 Automatically Collected Information.** Similar to other web sites, we will collect some information automatically and store it in log files, for example, through the use of "cookies" and other tracking mechanisms. This information does not identify you. This collection may include, but is not limited to, your IP address, browser type and language, referring/exit pages and URLs, other browser history, platform type, number of clicks, landing pages, cookie information, the pages you requested and viewed, the amount of time spent on particular pages, and the date and time. We collect this non-personally identifiable information in order to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. We may also use cookies, clear gifs, and log file information to: (a) store information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Site; (b) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (c) track entries, submissions, and status in any interactive portion of the Site.

**3.3 Cookies.** A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Our third-party analytics providers use cookies to record information about your activities on the Site and to "remember" you when you return to the Site. The use of cookies is common and many websites use them to provide useful features to visitors. Some cookies remain on your computer until you delete them. Others, like session ID cookies, expire when you close your browser. You may set your browser setting to attempt to reject cookies and you may still use the Site. See the section "Online Tracking and your Choices" below for more information on how the Site may respond to your browser settings. We do not control the use of cookies by third parties. See the section on "Third-Party Providers" below.

**3.4 Pixels (aka web beacons/web bugs/java script).** Pixels are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are used to track the online movements of web users. Unlike cookies, which are stored on a user's computer hard drive, pixels are small graphics that are about the size of the period at the end of the sentence that are embedded invisibly on web pages or in HTML-based emails. Our third-party analytics providers may place pixels on our web site that track what other web sites you visit (both before and after visiting the Site). Our third-party analytics providers use information obtained from pixels to help us improve our Site. We do not control the use of pixels by third parties. See the section on "Third-party Providers" below.

**3.5 Third-Party Providers.** We use third parties to help us operate and improve the Site. We may provide these third parties information we collect and they may collect information from you about your use of the Site. The information we share with third parties will, unless specifically noted otherwise in this Policy, be governed by this Policy and may only be used by those third parties to help us operate or improve the Site and to provide services to us. We do not control information collected by third parties and are not responsible for their use of that information. 

#### 4\. CHILDREN's PRIVACY

**4.1 General.** The School Course component of the Site is intended for users of all ages and we may collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 ("child" or "children"). Any information collected from children is in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"). Below is a list of when we may collect information from children and how and when we will provide parental notice and seek parental consent in such cases. If we collect information from a child, we will only retain the information so long as reasonably necessary to fulfill a request, to allow the child to participate in an activity, to ensure the security of our services, or as required by law. If we discover that we have collected information from a child in a manner that is inconsistent with COPPA, we will either immediately seek parental consent or delete the information. We will never publicly post a child's personally identifiable information.

**4.2 Child Registration.** A child may register on the Site in order to take the course. During the registration process, we may ask the child to provide his or her birth date in order to verify age. If, during the registration process, we determine that a child is a child under the age of 13, we will ask for a parent or guardian email address before we collect any personally identifiable information from the child. Following verification, we may collect the child's name, email address, a user name, and password that they select.

**4.3 Teacher Consent.** If a child is using the course as part of a school-based activity, COPPA allows teachers or school administrators to provide consent for the collection of personally identifiable information from children.

**4.4 Child Quiz Results.** A child's quiz results may be shared with a child's course teacher if the child joins a classroom connected with a teacher account. 

**4.5 Email Contact with a Child.** BHP may, from time to time, send email to a child's email address in order to respond to inquiries or for account administration purposes. Following any such use of a child's email address, BHP will immediately delete the child's personally identifiable information. 

**4.6 Parental Control.** At any time, a parent or guardian may request that we delete the personally identifiable information that has been collected in connection with their child. When a parent makes such a request, it may lead to the termination of the child's account. Parents or guardians may make such a request by contacting us at: [info@bighistoryproject.com](mailto:info@bighistoryproject.com). When requesting removal of a child's personally identifiable information or cancellation of a child's account, parents or guardians should include the following information: Account ID (email address). To protect a child's privacy, we will take reasonable steps to verify a parent or guardian's identity prior to deleting a child's information.

#### 5\. ONLINE TRACKING AND YOUR CHOICES

As discussed above, because we track website usage information through the use of cookies, pixels and other tracking mechanisms, your selection of the "Do Not Track" option provided by your browser may not have any effect on our collection of cookie information. The only way to completely "opt out" of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser to delete and disable cookies and other tracking/recording tools. However, getting a "Do Not Track" signal to work as you might want is difficult. Using browsers as an example, not all tracking technologies can be controlled by browsers; unique aspects of your browser might be recognizable even if you disable a tracking technology; not all settings will necessarily last or be effective; even if a setting is effective for one purpose data still may be collected for another; and even if one website observes a "Do Not Track" signal, that website usually will not be able to control other websites.

#### 6\. INFORMATION SECURITY MEASURES

Personally identifiable information collected by the Site is stored in operating environments that are not available to the public. While we have mechanisms in place to safeguard your personal information after we receive it, no transmission of data over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.

#### 7\. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION

**7.1 General.** We may use your personally identifiable information for the purpose of communicating with you about the Big History Project, your account, or to provide you with other information that we think may be of interest to you. We may also use your name and email address to enable you to sign-in to certain portions of the Site or to personalize your experience on the Site.

If you cancel your account, we may, but are not obligated to, delete information we have collected or obtained from third parties and we may continue to use and disclose it in accordance with this Policy. We may dispose of any information we collect in our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law.
