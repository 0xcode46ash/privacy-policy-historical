Updated December 26, 2016

## Overview

Nox Digital Entertainment Co. Limited, and its subsidiaries* (“Bignox.com”, “Nox” or “we”, or “our” or “us”), are committed to protecting your personal information and respecting your privacy. 

In general, you can visit Nox on the Web without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. To the extent that you do provide information to Nox, Nox will never sell, rent or disclose your personally identifiable information to outside parties for their own marketing purposes without your consent. With your permission, Nox may send you e-mail regarding our new products, upgrades, or select third party products. We do not disclose your personally identifiable information to such third parties. 

## Information That We Gather and Track

Nox only collects personal information which is reasonably necessary for its dealings with the individuals to whom the information relates. The types of personal information Nox collects will depend on the particular dealings we have with you. However, generally, we collect and hold personal information about existing and prospective customers, our third party service providers and suppliers, and employment applicants.

Generally, Nox collects personal information directly from the individuals concerned. For instance, there are times when we may need to collect information from you through our Web Sites. This generally involves filling out forms so you can download or order a Nox or third party product from our Web Sites. When you download the products we require you to fill out a form with your name and email address.

Nox may also collect personal information about individuals indirectly from third parties, such as from our business partners, from third party providers of marketing lists, and through various other methods, including:

  * Cookies
  * Referrers
  * IP addresses
  * System information



None of these methods can be used to identify, or reasonably identify, you with the exception of cookies, which can optionally store information that you may enter in forms on our Web Sites.

This User Information may be retained by Nox to verify compliance with the agreement between Nox and your employer, to keep track of the domains from which people visit us, to create a user profile to better serve you, or to simply contact you either electronically or otherwise. If you decide that we should not use your personal User Information to contact you, please let us know and we will not use that information for such purpose. However, please do not submit any User Information if you are less than 18 years of age.

You may separately agree to provide your personal information to third parties that provide content for Nox offerings, in order to access and/or use their products and/or services. If you agree to provide such information to these third parties, then your personal information will be subject to their privacy policies.

  * Accuracy and Security



The accuracy and security of the User Information is important to Nox. If you contact us to correct your User Information, we will attempt to correct such inaccuracies in a timely manner.

We also continue to implement procedures to maintain accurate, complete and current User Information.

  * Cookies



Nox uses "cookies". The use of cookies is an industry standard, and you'll find cookies at most major websites. A cookie is a small data file that a website can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to keep records of the visits to such site. A cookie contains information, such as your User Information, that helps us recognize the pages you have visited and improve future visits, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is the information that you provide yourself. A cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive or read cookie files created by other sites. If you prefer not to accept a cookie, you can set your Web browser to refuse all cookies or to warn you before accepting a cookie. You can still access most of the features on our website even without accepting a cookie.

  * External Links



Nox’s website provides links to other third party websites. Even if the third party is affiliated with Nox through a business partnership or otherwise, Nox is not responsible for the privacy policies or practices or the content of such external links. These links are provided to you for convenience purposes only and you access them at your own risk.

  * Google Analytics and Advertising



Nox uses all features of Google Analytics for Display Advertisers. This includes obtaining specific visitor cookie data, such as the source, medium and keyword used to visit our Web Sites. Google Analytics does not store any visitor-specific data and we will not use visitor-specific data in any way related to Google Analytics, Google AdWords, and Remarketing. Nox and other third-party vendors, including Google, use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookie) and third-party cookies (such as the DoubleClick cookie) together to inform, optimize, and serve ads based on visitors’ past visits to our Web Sites.

## Terms of Use
