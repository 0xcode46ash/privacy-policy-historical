**privacy is personal  . . .**  
. . . and based on trust. At BIGWORDS, we are making every effort to keep your trust with our commitment to the protection of your personal privacy. **how we use your information**

  1. Like most Internet companies, BIGWORDS automatically tracks certain general information about you for the purposes of improving our marketing and promotional efforts, maintaining browser compatibility, and enabling us to service you quickly and efficiently. We also monitor customer traffic patterns and site usage to help us improve the content, design, and layout of the site. When you visit BIGWORDS, our Web server gathers this information by tracking your domain name (e.g. aol.com), _not_ your e-mail address.
  2. When you order, we need your name and e-mail address, which we will use to fulfill your order and to deliver information to you regarding your order. Occasionally, we may use your name and e-mail address to notify you about important content and functionality changes, new services, and special offers or information that we think you'll find interesting. If you would rather not receive such information, just e-mail us at [removeme@bigwords.com.](mailto:removeme@bigwords.com)
  3. In order to process, fulfill, and service your order, we also need your mailing address, credit card number, and credit card expiration date. Your credit card information is kept strictly private and confidential.
  4. When you enter a contest or other promotional feature on the site, we usually need your name, address, and e-mail address so we can manage the promotion and notify winners.

  
**protecting your private information**  
Whenever you place an order or access your BIGWORDS account, you automatically use our secure e-commerce server and secure server software (SSL). This means that all the information you input is encrypted before it is sent to us, and once submitted to us, all customer data is protected against unauthorized access. Also, be sure to check out our security guarantee. **what about "cookies"**  
Like most e-commerce and membership sites, we use cookies, which are small bits of information stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. Our cookies do not contain any personal information, but they do remember your settings and your bookbag contents when you change screens to order another book. **third party disclosure**  
BIGWORDS uses your personal information for the purposes of serving you to the best of our ability. Occasionally we may share or make available personally identifiable ("personal") and aggregate customer information to third parties. For instance, we may share non-individual statistical or demographic information in aggregate form with third parties. Additionally, we may share the name, address, and e-mail address of sweepstakes entrants with the sponsors (aka the prize-givers) and third parties administering the sweepstakes. If you do not want us to share your personal information with other companies or organizations, let us know by e-mailing us at [nopromo@bigwords.com.](mailto:nopromo@bigwords.com)

If you enter BIGWORDS via a "co-branded" site-that is, if you get to us by way of another site that we do business with-your personal information and transaction information may be gathered by both parties and used by each of us in accordance with our respective privacy policies. No credit card, password, or student identification information will be shared with co-branded partners.

Finally, you understand that we must cooperate fully should a situation arise where we are required by law or legal process to provide information about a customer.

 **TAF! information**  
If you send an e-mail to your friend via our TAF! service, only your friend will know about it. The e-mail addresses submitted for the TAF! service are not retained by BIGWORDS. **the opt-out clause; or, your choice**  
BIGWORDS gives you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving extra communications. At any time you decide that you don't want to receive extra e-mails from us, you can opt-out of extra communications with one fast flick of the wrist. Simply go to your user profile, or any e-mail you get from us, click the link indicated, and you'll be instantly removed from our e-mail sending database. **your password**  
A quick word about passwords: keep 'em to yourself! If you disclose your password to any third party, you may lose substantial control over your personally identifiable information, which could lead to - big complications. So, if your password has been compromised for any reason, let us know immediately at [bigwords@bigwords.com](mailto:bigwords@bigwords.com) **your consent**
