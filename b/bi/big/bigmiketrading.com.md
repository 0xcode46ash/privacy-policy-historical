# Privacy Policy - Big Mike Trading Forum

This policy can be modified at any time without notice and your continued use of the forums indicates your acceptance.

When you visit Big Mike Trading, we send one or more cookies to your web browser. A cookie is a small, harmless piece of information that is stored in your browser. Only the domain which set that cookie can access the information from it. (ie, other domains can't access cookies set by us and we can't access cookies set by others).

Whever your access a file from our website, the server may log the following data: (i) Requested URL, (ii) Your IP address, (iii) Date & Time of request, (iv) Your user agent, (v) Referring webpage (if any), and (vi) Size of the requested document.

In the process of creating an account on BMT, we ask for your email address. This is done to verify your identity & that you are a real human being; and not some unscrupulous bot submitting web forms across the internet. Also, each thread, post, message you create on the Forum is associated with your Forum account & stamped with your I.P. address.

We use a visitor tracking and analysis service to see how our website, website sections and webpages are performing. (e.g. Unique Visitors, Page Views, Total Visitors, etc.). This information also allows us to see what part of the forum you have visited (threads visited).

We track outbound clicks from our webpages. The URI of clicked link and URI of the page from which the click was originated is stored.

BMT uses Google Adsense to serve advertisements relevant to the webpage content. To know more about what information Google collects and uses, check out their General [Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html) and [Advertising Policy](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html) pages.

Email addresses you entered while registering on the Forum are used to provide you updates of any content which you have subscribed to. Occasionally, we send out newsletters and/or important announcements regarding the changes in website, ongoing contests, webinars or events, etc. We may also email you promotional or marketing material from a paid advertiser on occasion. You may opt-out of any or all of these emails at your sole discretion - the body of the email will contain instructions for unsubscribing. Your email address is safe with us, we won't sell it to anyone!

The password which you use to login to the Forum account is salted and then encrypted before being saved in our database. It's NEVER stored in a plaintext format. This way even we can't see what your password is. And that's why in case you forget your login password, we can't retrieve it for you; we are only able to change it to something else.
