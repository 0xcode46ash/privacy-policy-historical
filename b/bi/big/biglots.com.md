# Privacy Policy

| 

This Privacy Policy applies to each Big Lots (“Big Lots,” “us” or “we”) web site (“Site”) and is a part of the Site’s [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040316id_/http%3A//www.biglots.com/useragreement/default.aspx).  This Privacy Policy was developed as an extension of our commitment to the highest level of integrity in dealing with our customers. This Privacy Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how we collect, use, disclose and safeguard the personal information you provide to us when you use the Site or join the Buzz ClubTM.  By using the Site or joining the Buzz ClubTM, you agree to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.  If you do not agree to the terms of this policy, do not use the Site or join the Buzz ClubTM. 

_Providers._   We use third parties to operate the Site, collect information, conduct marketing and research, and perform other services for us.  We refer to those third parties collectively in this Agreement as our “Providers.”  Where we discuss our collection and use of information, we may use our Providers to collect and/or use the information on our behalf.

_Collection of Personal Information._  We only collect personal information from you when you provide it to us.  For example, we collect personal information from you when you:  (1) sign up to receive our emails; (2) join the Buzz ClubTM; (3) participate in the Site’s interactive features, including those that invite you to submit an idea to us; (4) participate in a sweepstakes or contest; (5) participate in a survey, chat room, message board, blog or other forum; (6) make a purchase on the Site; or (7) contact us for any reason.  The information we collect may include your name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, payment information (such as credit card number), as well as the contents of your communications with us.  We may combine the information we collect from you with information we receive from you offline, as well as with information we receive about you from other sources, such as address update services. 

If you use any of the Site’s tell-a-friend features, we ask for your friend’s email address.  We use this information only to send the communication you requested and to monitor the effectiveness of our tell-a-friend features.

_Collection of Non-Personal Information._  Similar to other commercial websites, we utilize “cookies” and web server logs to collect information about how the Site is used.  Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by your browser on your hard drive.  Information gathered through cookies and web server logs may include your browser type, operating system, IP address, the date and time of visits, the pages and products viewed, time spent at the Site, the websites visited just before and after the Site and other clickstream information.  None of this information is associated with you as an individual.   We use this information to:  (1) conduct research, in order to improve the Site, our products and services and to better serve our customers; (2) provide you with customized content and advertising; and (3) monitor Site usage.  

We may also use web beacons on the Site and in our emails.  Web beacons are tiny graphic images that are used to collect information about your Site visit, such as the pages you view and the features you use, as well as information about whether you open and/or act upon one of our emails.  Web beacons help us analyze our Site visitors’ behavior and measure the effectiveness of the Site and our email campaigns.

_Protecting Your Email Address, Log-In Information and Password._  It is solely your responsibility to maintain the privacy of your email address, log-in information and password.  Your failure to do so may result in unauthorized access to your personal information. Please keep your email address, log-in information and password in a safe place. We have no liability to you for a stolen or misappropriated email address, log-in information or password. 

_How Do We Use the Information That You Provide to Us?_  We use the information we collect from and about you for the following purposes:  (1) to fulfill your requests for products, services, features and information; (2) to provide you with targeted offers and advertising on the Site; (3) to contact you with information and promotional materials and offers; (4) to contact you when necessary; (5) to review Site usage and operations; (6) to administer the Buzz ClubTM; (7) to address problems with the Site, our business or our products and services; (8) to protect the security or integrity of the Site and our business; and (9) as otherwise described in the User Communications section of the Site’s [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040316id_/http%3A//www.biglots.com/useragreement/default.aspx).  If you would prefer to no longer receive commercial emails from us, you may follow the opt-out instructions contained in the email or by emailing us at [talk2us@BigLots.com](mailto:talk2us@biglots.com).   If you are a Buzz ClubTM member, you may also go to [www.biglots.com/unsubscribe/](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040316id_/http%3A//www.biglots.com/unsubscribe) to revise your marketing preferences.

_Third Parties’ Products, Services and Websites._  The Site may include third-party advertising and links to third-party websites.  Such third parties may have privacy policies and user agreements that differ from our own, and we are not responsible for their activities and practices.  Accordingly, we recommend that you review the privacy policy and user agreement posted on any site that you may access through the Site. 

_Sharing Information with Strategic Partners and Affiliated Parties._  We may enter into strategic marketing alliances and web development alliances where a third party (including Providers) may be given access to the information we have collected from and about you, for the purpose of providing you information regarding products and services.

_Do We Disclose Information to Outside Parties (not already discussed above)?_  We may also disclose information collected from and about you as follows:  (1) to our Providers, including payment processors, if the disclosure will enable them to perform a business, professional or technical support function for us; (2) as necessary, if we believe that there has been a violation of the Site’s [User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20081217040316id_/http%3A//www.biglots.com/useragreement/default.aspx) or of our rights or the rights of any third party; (3) to respond to judicial process and provide information to law enforcement agencies or in connection with an investigation on matters related to public safety, as permitted by law, or otherwise as required by law; (4) if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Big Lots or any of our affiliates, service providers, customers or others; and (5) if Big Lots or substantially all of its assets are acquired, your personal information may be one of the transferred assets.  In addition, we may provide aggregate, non-personally identifiable information to third parties for research and other purposes. 

_Are Information Transmissions Secured?_  We use encryption technology on our join, login, account management and checkout pages. 

_How Do We Protect Your Information?_  Our corporate values, ethical standards, policies and practices are committed to the protection of customer information.  Accordingly, we have taken certain physical, electronic, contractual and managerial steps to safeguard the personal information we collect from Site visitors and Buzz ClubTM members.
