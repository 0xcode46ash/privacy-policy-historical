# BIG 92.7 FM

This privacy statement is applicable to all BIG 92.7FM web-sites.  
The BIG 92.7FM respects the privacy of its Internet users and will protect that privacy as vigorously as possible.

BIG 92.7FM does not collect information that personally identifies individuals except when individuals provide such specific information on a voluntary basis. There may be occasions where specific personal information is requested before an individual can enter certain sections of a BIG 92.7FM site. For example, registration is needed to participate in any BIG 92.7FM online contest. This kind of registration helps us to ensure that content standards on these sections of the site are rigorously upheld or that contact can be made with prize winners.

In all such cases, BIG 92.7FM will collect only information that is voluntarily provided by the user and undertakes that such information will be kept strictly confidential. Individual information provided to the BIG 92.7FM to gain access to any BIG 92.7FM site will not be sold or made available to a third party.   
BIG 92.7FM does reserve the right, however, to perform statistical analyses of user behaviour and characteristics, in order to measure interest in and use of the various sections of its sites so as to improve design and navigation and to gather marketing information. Only aggregated data from these analyses, not individual data, will be used for this purpose.

As well, users should be aware that certain non-personal information and data may be automatically collected by the BIG 92.7FM through the operation of what are called "cookies". "Cookies" are small text files that identify an individual computer's browser entering a web site. They allow the site to track that browser's movement through the site over several sessions. Through cookies, a web site can recognize repeat users, facilitate the user's access to and use of the site and allow a site to track usage behaviour that will allow content improvements. The BIG 92.7FM uses cookies only for the above-mentioned purposes and will not use them to identify users or to track non-BIG 92.7FM usage. 

If you do not want a cookie placed on your computer by the BIG 92.7FM, you may disable cookies altogether by modifying the Preferences section of your Netscape or Internet Explorer browser (under Edit/Preferences/Advanced). Note that it is possible that some aspects of BIG 92.7FM sites may be unavailable to you if you choose this option.

If you have no problem accepting cookies, but wish to be informed of their appearance, you may turn on a warning prompt by modifying the cookie warning section in Edit/Preferences/Advanced.
