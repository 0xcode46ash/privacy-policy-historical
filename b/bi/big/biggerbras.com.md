 **Customer Information**

BGB does not release or sell the names and addresses of its customers obtained through its website or other activities. All information is held as "strictly confidential" by BGB.

 **Email**

An email acknowledgement is sent when an order is placed on our web site.

In an effort to reduce inappropriate email (i.e. SPAM lists) 

sent to our customer service address: Effective January, 2004 we no longer send an auto-reply to incoming emails.

In order to better assist our existing customers, BGB attempts to 

personally answer all customer inquiries within 72 to 96 hours. Occasionally, responses may take an additional day.

If you are an existing customer, please include your full name, email address, order date and order-id number in your email, AND complete questions or instructions.

One word instructions such as "Cancel" or "Change" can not be processed.

If you disabled cookies in the past, please make sure that you have cookies enabled (the default setting when you installed your browser software) on your browser in order to place your order online. If you do not wish to enable cookies, please phone in your order.

BGB uses the secure server software (SSL) of [Plug 'n Pay Technologies, Inc.](http://www.plugnpay.com/content/about.html) for secure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of your personal information including credit card number, name, and address, so that it cannot be read as the information travels over the Internet.
