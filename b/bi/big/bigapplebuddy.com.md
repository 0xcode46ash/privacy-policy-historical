**4\. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals**

As there is currently no industry standard on how Do Not Track signals should be responded to or how Do Not Track functionality is activated across various web browsers, BAB does not at the present time generally respond to Do Not Track signals.

**5\. Cookies**

A ‘Cookie’ is a text-only string of characters that is temporarily stored in your computer’s memory. Our Cookies are time sensitive. If the expiration of a Cookie is set to be longer than the time you spend on a site, then this string is saved in a Cookie on your hard drive for future reference, otherwise it disappears from your computer when your browser is closed. Cookies such as those we use cannot retrieve information from your computer’s hard drive, destroy files, or send viruses. When a Cookie is placed on your hard drive, it does not allow access to your personal information although it may be used to identify your computer. BAB may use Cookies to track the pages that a user visits on the Site so that information can be customized to the visitor on a session-by-session basis, and so that future visits on the Site may be enhanced. It is a quick and convenient means of keeping site content fresh and relevant to the viewer.

If you would prefer not to accept Cookies, most browsers will allow you to:

(a) change your browser settings to notify you when you receive a Cookie, which lets you choose whether or not to accept it;

(b) disable existing Cookies; or

(c) set your browser to automatically reject any Cookies.

Please be aware that if you disable or reject Cookies, some features and services on our Site may not work properly.

**6\. Web Beacons**

In conjunction with Cookies, BAB may also, from time to time, use “Web Beacons” on the Site and in some BAB emails to monitor traffic generated from various forms of advertising such as banner ads, or to track general traffic. A Web Beacon is a graphic on a web page or in an email message designed to track pages viewed and messages opened. Web Beacons are often invisible because they are typically only 1-pixel by 1-pixel in size. In many cases, companies place Web Beacons on web pages to collect data about visitors. When a user requests a page on our Site, the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated. Once the Web Beacon is retrieved/activated, it points to an external site to retrieve the image. At that time it can also pass along information such as the IP address of the computer that retrieved the image, the time the Web Beacon was viewed and for how long, and the type of browser that retrieved the image. This information is then compiled and made available to BAB. Web Beacons, along with Cookies, enable us to enhance your experience on the Site and assess our marketing efforts; like Cookies, Web Beacons do not access your personal information.

**7\. Interest-Based Marketing**

We contract with third-party advertising agencies, marketing entities and other third party service providers to serve advertisements when you visit the Site or other web sites across the Internet. The advertisements placed on these third-party web sites may use tracking technologies, such as Cookies and Web Beacons, to collect anonymous information about your visits to the Site and other web sites. BAB may also share anonymous information with these companies in aggregate form and/or engage with these companies to provide interest-based advertising both on and off the Site or other web sites operated by BAB and/or its affiliated entities. In either case, the purpose of the sharing is to provide advertisements about products and services that may be of interest to you, analyzing and improving the effectiveness of ads and e-mails, and improving and enhancing the Site and its content.

BAB also may use Google Analytics Display Advertising on the Site to collect data about traffic on our Site; the Google Analytic features we may implement from time to time include:

(a) remarketing with Google Analytics;

(b) Google Display Network Impression Reporting; and

(c) Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting focusing on:

i. affinity categories which identifies users in terms of lifestyle interests (examples: sports fans or technophiles); and

ii. in-market segment categories which identifies users based on their product purchases interests.

BAB complies with Google’s applicable policies regarding implementation of these features.
