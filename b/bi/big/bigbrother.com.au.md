**PRIVACY POLICY:**

**Welcome to Big Brother**

This privacy policy has been created in order to disclose the information gathering and dissemination practices for this web site, www.bigbrother.com.au. This policy is in addition to the [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20011205083322id_/http%3A//bigbrother.com.au/termsofuse.asp) governing the Website and should be read in conjunction with those Terms of Use.

Questions regarding this policy should be directed in the first instance to the Privacy Coordinator by writing to us at the following address:

Privacy Coordinator  
Big Brother

Coomera QLD 4209

The Website is owned and operated by Southern Star Endemol Pty Limited, a 50:50 joint venture between Southern Star Entertainment Pty Limited and [Endemol Entertainment (Finance) B.V](http://www.endemol.com/). You can find out more about these organisations by clicking on the names. Information provided by you to the Website may be shared amongst these companies, including their subsidiaries and related companies. However, except in the limited circumstances set out below, none of these companies will provide personally identifiable information about you to third parties without your express permission.

**Collection of Personal Information**

We take your electronic privacy seriously. While we are the sole owner of the information we gather on the Website, we will not share any of your information with any outside party without your explicit consent unless we are required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to the edicts of the law, cooperate with law enforcement or other government agencies, or comply with a legal process served on the Website or court orders.

There are two kinds of information that websites can obtain about you:  
_Aggregate Information:_ Aggregate Information is anonymous data that websites use to analyze trends, administer the Website, diagnose problems on the sites’ servers, track user’s movement, gather broad demographic information for aggregate use and to help improve the quality of the web pages. It may be your domain name or your IP address. None of this information is connected with Personally Identifiable Information.

_Personally Identifiable Information:_ Personally Identifiable Information is any information that personally identifies you. When you become a Website member, we ask you for personal details including name, post code, date of birth, country of origin, gender and email address. We may also ask you to provide us with some lifestyle information when you register with the Website or for various features of the Website.

Some of the information that we ask you for is mandatory. It enables us to identify who is using the service and enables you to get the most out of Big Brother. With other questions it is up to you whether or not you answer them.

We also record other information including responses to promotions, give-aways and competitions. Whenever a page is requested from our webserver, we record the time, date and URL of the request, along with information on the browser software that is being used. This information is collected to enable us to better understand the preferences of our members and to enable us to better target our communications including competitions and prizes.

We may share Aggregate Information with our partners and advertisers. We will not share your Personally Identifiable Information with any third party unless we tell you otherwise when asking for it. We will give you a way to "opt out" of being contacted by us and any third parties.

Here are some ways we might use that Personally Identifiable Information: 

  * To notify you if you are a winner.  

  * To send you information about Big Brother, us and the Website.  

  * Where you have agreed, to give to our content partners, who may send you promotional material.  


We may send you information on behalf of our advertisers. We will not give them your Personally Identifiable Information without your express permission.

We will not disseminate any Personally Identifiable Information about you without your consent unless we believe it is necessary: 

  * Because it is required by law.  

  * To provide you with a service which you have requested.  

  * To implement our terms of sevice  

  * To protect our rights or property or those of any Website user, or any member of the public.  

  * To lessen a serious threat to a person's health or safety.

Please note that we may be required to make copies of or store records (which may include Personally Identifiable Information) in order to comply with our record-keeping obligations under Australian laws.

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send you site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with you to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to your account via email or phone.

**Deleting or Modifying Personal Information**

If you've given us personally identifiable information in the past and then have second thoughts or want to update it, here are your choices:

1) Click on the My Details link under Members in the left navigation bar of the website (you will need to be logged in to view this link). Your details will appear in the form you used to register on our website. Make any required changes then submit your new details by clicking on the green Go! button at the bottom of the page.

OR

2)Normal mail to:  
Privacy Coordinator  
Big Brother  
c/- Dreamworld Theme Park  
Dreamworld Parkway,  
Coomera QLD 4209

Although it is not always possible to remove or modify information in the databases, we will make reasonable efforts to do so. If you've given us information for third party (as we mentioned above) and we've already passed it on, we cannot delete or change the information. At your request, we will inform you how to contact those third parties who hold information relevant to you.

You can access and update your personal information and preferences by selecting 'My Details' from the left navigation bar of the website. Your details will be shown in the registration form you filled in upon joining our website. Please check that the information you have given us is current and accurate. If any changes are required, please make the appropriate changes then save the form by clicking the green 'go!' button at the bottom of the page. Please note that, unless you notify us otherwise, we will assume that any personal information and preferences in the 'My Details' section is correct and up-to-date.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. The use of cookies on websites is a common industry standard. Cookies act as unique identifiers, used to distinguish between different members. They can enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site. For instance, by setting a cookie on the Website, you would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. Once you log out of your browser, the cookie simply terminates. Please note that even after we have terminated a cookie, remnants of that cookie may remain on your computer. These remnants are normally inactive.

The Website uses cookies to allow access to members only sections. If a user rejects the cookie, he/she may still use the Website. The only drawback to this is that they will not have access to members only areas of the site. For example, you would not be able to participate in any of our competitions that take place.

Some of our business partners use cookies on the Website (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies or any information collected by these business partners.

We may use cookies when we conduct voting polls, surveys, and contests to limit multiple responses and registrations. We may also send third parties information from cookies to enable them to deliver more personalised advertising to you.

We will never use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not originally sent by us to you in a cookie.

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. If you'd prefer, you can set yours to refuse cookies or to alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the site, such as the voting polls, surveys, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so.

**Spamming**

Spamming is sending mass unsolicited emails. We operate an opt-in only policy so we’ll only send you promotional material if we have your permission, unless there is a legal or operational requirement for us to do so.

If there’s promotional material coming at you that you don’t want, please tell us.

**Security of Personal Information**

We’ve taken reasonable precautions to protect your security. These include protection of passwords using 128-bit encryption, provisions to preserve the security of the information in our own systems and to prevent unauthorised access, use of disclosure and back-up systems to prevent accidental or malicious loss of data.

Unfortunately, there’s always a risk involved in sending information through any channel including the Internet and you do it entirely at your own risk.

We will not be responsible for any unauthorised access or use of information held by us. We will also not be responsible if your information is accessed through an unauthorised or improper use of your account or membership privileges due to your failure to adequately secure your password.

When you register on the Website you will create a user name and password. You can play an important role in keeping your personal information secure, by maintaining the confidentiality of any password and accounts used on the Website.

If you suspect that someone has your user name and password and you don’t want them to have it, please let us know or change them immediately. You can update your password, including actions that you didn’t approve or authorise yourself.

A few of our employees and contractors will have access to your personal information to a level that is necessary to enable them to perform their jobs. They are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us.

**Links to Third Party Websites**

This Website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every web site that collects Personally Identifiable Information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Website.

**Notification of Changes to Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on the Website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.

**Additional Privacy Information**

If you are interested in obtaining additional information of privacy, you can visit the Australian Federal Privacy Commissioner’s website at [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/).
