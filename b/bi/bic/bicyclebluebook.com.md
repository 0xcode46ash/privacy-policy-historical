##### Collecting Information About You

In general, you can visit many of our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any personal information about yourself. We may track the Internet domain address from which people visit us and analyze this data for trends and statistics, but individual users will remain anonymous, unless you voluntarily tell us who you are. There may be times (such as when you subscribe to a service, or to participate in contests, sweepstakes or promotions, etc.) at which we ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, shipping/billing address, telephone number, email address, credit card information, birth date, gender, occupation, personal interests, etc. Whether or not to provide such information is completely your own choice. But if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to purchase products, or access certain services, offers and content on our web site.

##### Using Information About You

We use the information we collect from you for purposes that will help us serve you better, such as confirming and verifying subscription or registration, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, etc. Because we value our customers and your loyalty, we do not share your information with any third parties.

##### Editing, Updating, Correcting and Deleting Personal Information

We want to communicate with you only if you want to hear from us. If you prefer not to receive information from us, please email us at support@BicycleBlueBook.com, or call customer service at (408) 209-2558 Monday to Friday 9am to 5pm PST. Please be sure to include your email address, full name, and specifically what information you do not want to receive. If you would like to update or correct your email address, street address or other personal information with us please contact us the same way. Please note that sometimes these requests may take up to 6-8 weeks to be effective, particularly if we are removing your name from postal mailings. In addition, when you subscribe to our services, we may need to contact you via phone, email or mail to address questions, even if you have opted to not receive communications.

##### Cookies

Our web site does not use "cookies."

##### Security

We use sophisticated encryption and authentication tools to protect the security of your personal information that you share with us. Unfortunately, however, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to or from our web site, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we will do our best to protect its security on our systems.

##### Links to Third Party Sites

Our web site may contain links to web sites operated and maintained by third parties, over which we have no control. Privacy policies on such linked sites may be different from our privacy policy. You access such linked sites at your own risk. You should always read the privacy policy of a linked site before disclosing any personal information on such site.

##### Policy Changes

If we decide to change our privacy policy in whole or in part, we will inform you by posting a notice on our web site. Those changes will go into effect on the date posted in the notice. The new policy will apply to all current and past users of our web site and will replace any prior policies which are inconsistent.
