Cookies are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, Bid4Assets uses cookies to identify members so they do not have to enter a user id and password upon each visit. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. 

Bid4Assets uses cookies in a limited way. Cookies enable us to deliver content specific to your interests; they also tell us if you are using a browser that may not be compatible with our service. ****

Some of our sellers and service affiliates use "cookies".  Because we do not control the privacy policies of these non-Bid4Assets Web sites to which we may provide hyperlinks, you should check the privacy policy of sites you visit if you have concerns about their use of cookies.

Our site's registration form may require you to give us contact information (such as your name and email address).

**Security** [ (top)](http://www.bid4assets.com/Help/index.cfm?fuseAction=privacyPolicy#top)   
Bid4Assets gives high priority to protecting the privacy of your personal information and the security of your transactions. Among our many safety measures, we use the most secure server technology.

Certain browsers and computers have the ability to communicate securely by scrambling (or encrypting) the information as it passes across the Internet. This method of communication is called SSL, or Secure Socket Layer. We require the use of a secure browser before a connection can be made to the registration system.

We recommend that you use one of the two most popular browsers for your online sessions. If you are not currently using the most up-to-date versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, we urge you to upgrade now. When choosing a browser, make sure that you download and install a 128-bit version. The description provided by Netscape or Microsoft will ensure that you get the right one. If you need to update your browser please click [here](http://www.bid4assets.com/Help/index.cfm?fuseAction=downloads) .
