 ** _We are committed to protecting your privacy._**

Bid4Assets does not sell, trade or rent your personal information to others. Under limited circumstances, we may provide trustworthy third parties with information, but only after giving prior notice. In addition, you can tell us not to share your information by sending an email message to [service@Bid4Assets.com](mailto:service@bid4assets.com).

Bid4Assets.com created this Privacy Policy in order to demonstrate our serious commitment to privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site.

**"Cookies"**  
Some of our business affiliates and advertisers use "cookies," which can be used to tell when your computer has contacted a Web site.

We only use cookies in a limited way. They enable us to deliver content specific to your interests; they also tell us if you are using a browser that may not be compatible with our service. 

Because we do not control the privacy policies of our business affiliates, advertisers or any non-Bid4Assets.com sites to which we may provide hyperlinks, you should check the privacy policy of sites you visit if you have concerns about their use of cookies.

**Personal Information**  
Our site's registration form may require you to give us contact information (like your name and email address). If you are a seller, this information helps us to customize your experience on our site and to send you information about our company. If you are a buyer, this information helps us to customize your experience on our site, email you when particular assets become available and assure sellers that you are qualified to bid in accordance with our [Terms of Service](http://www.helptermsofservice.cfm/). Both buyers and sellers may opt-out of receiving future mailings (see opt-out section, below).

**Public Forums**  
This site may make chat rooms, forums, message boards and news groups available to you. 

Please remember that any information or asset listings that you disclose in these areas become public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in any of these areas.

**Security**  
We Take It Seriously Bid4Assets.com gives high priority to protecting the privacy of your personal information and the security of your transactions. Among our many safety measures, we use the most secure server technology, provide an escrow service to safeguard against fraudulent claims, disallow buyers and sellers to know each other's identities and may soon provide credit checks on potential buyers.

Certain browsers and computers have the ability to communicate securely by scrambling (or encrypting) the information as it passes across the Internet. This method of communication is called SSL, or Secure Socket Layer. We require the use of a secure browser before a connection can be made to the registration system.

After you reach us using the secure browser, we take measures to make sure your information is kept secure and confidential. Your information passes through a "firewall," which is a computer specifically designed to keep out unauthorized users. The information is also scrambled again to ensure that only Bid4Assets.com and its authorized representatives can read it.

We recommend that you use one of the two most popular browsers for your online sessions. If you are not currently using the most up-to-date versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer or Netscape Navigator, we urge you to upgrade now. When choosing a browser, make sure that you download and install a 128-bit version. The description provided by Netscape or Microsoft will ensure that you get the right one.

Fraud occurs on even the most secure sites, and use of our site is at your own risk. By using Bid4Assets.com, you acknowledge that you are aware of security and privacy limitations, including but not limited to: (1) the limitation of security, privacy and authentication measures and features in this system; (2) that data or information on the service may be subject to eavesdropping, sniffing, spoofing, forgery, spamming, "impostering," tampering, breaking passwords, harassment, fraud, electronic trespassing, hacking, nuking, system contamination (including, without limitation, viruses, worms and Trojan horses) causing unauthorized, damaging or harmful access and/or retrieval of information and data on your computer, as well as other security or privacy hazards; and (3) that data may not reach its destination or may reach an erroneous address or recipient.

**Legally Required Disclosures**

You should also be aware that there may be occasions where we are legally required to disclose information about you, such as in a response to a subpoena, to prevent fraud or to comply with a legally permitted inquiry by a government agency or regulator. 

**Your Consent**  
By using Bid4Assets.com, you consent to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**Opting Out**

At the time of this message, you will be able to opt-out of this information usage by sending a message to the following email: service@Bid4Assets.com.
