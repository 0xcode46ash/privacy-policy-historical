## What we do with the information we gather

**We will not sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties unless we have your permission or are required by law.**

We require this information to understand your needs and provide you with a better service, and in particular for the following reasons: 

  * Internal record keeping. 
  * If you sell or win an item to another user of our website, your name, physical address and email address will be provided to that user so that the transaction can be completed. However, your phone number and all other personal information will not be provided to that user; unless our staff, and/or that user is unable to reach you by MyMessage or email regarding an open issue with a transaction within a reasonable amount of time. 
  * We may use the information to improve our products and services.

However, we may still send important system and other related emails if need be, though unlikely. Your email address will also be used to send you updates on items you are currently involved with, the extent of which you can modify from the Account Details page. 
  * From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research purposes. We may contact you by email, phone, fax or mail. We may use the information to customize the website according to your interests. 



## Handling of Payments

To settle your account balance (the fees you incur through selling items) with bidStart, all payments are handled through PayPal. You do not need a PayPal account to pay though, just a credit card (PayPal can process credit cards without the need of an account). Paypal helps ensure that your credit card information stays private. As for individual items you wish to purchase on our website, the seller will specify what payment forms they accept and are solely responsible for any information you provide them. 

## MyMessages

An automated system is in place to ensure members do not use the MyMessages system in a way which is not compliant with our terms and conditions; for example sending spam, bulk messages, links to outside websites, and all other applicable terms and conditions. In some cases, when our admin staff is alerted to possible terms and conditions violations, or if there is an issue with a specific transaction, our admin staff may manually review MyMessages if neccessary to resolve any outstanding issues. 

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.
