# BioWare: Privacy Policy (Updated April 1, 2008)

Privacy Policy (Updated April 1, 2008)

BioWare considers issues relating to your privacy to be a serious matter. As such, BioWare has created and implemented this Privacy Policy so that you understand what BioWare may and may not do with certain personal information. This Privacy Policy describes the guidelines BioWare uses to protect the information we collect about you during your visit(s) to our Web Sites. By visiting BioWare's Web Sites and/or purchasing products through the BioWare Store, you consent to the collection and use of information described below and in the [BioWare Store Policy](https://web.archive.org/legal/store_policy.html) or [Web Site Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/legal/terms.html).

This Privacy Policy will apply to all websites of BioWare that link to this Privacy Policy.

### Introduction

BioWare will only use personally identifiable information about you in accordance with this Privacy Policy, the Web Site Terms of Use and the BioWare Store Policy. Personally identifiable information is information about you that can be attributed to you. In this Privacy Policy, personally identifiable information will be referred to as "personal information".

### Collection of Information

In order to use some of the features and services provided at BioWare's websites, BioWare may require that you provide some personal information. This personal information could include, but is not limited to, your name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card information, IP address and personal interests. BioWare may issue to you a unique "user ID" which you will be required to provide each time you use certain features and services.

In order to purchase digital products or other items available for sale on the BioWare Store, BioWare may require credit card information. BioWare's use of credit card information is explained in, and governed by, the BioWare Store Policy.

In addition, BioWare uses "cookies" and other technologies on its websites. Cookies are a unique identifier that are sent to your Internet browser. The Internet browser may then store the cookie on your harddrive. Cookies can be used to track a visitor to a website as the visitor navigates the website and to store information. Firstly, cookies enable a visitor to have a more unique and enriching experience while visiting BioWare's websites. For example, if a visitor requests that the webpages be delivered to the visitor in a specific language a cookie will be used to record this information so that the visitor does not need to specify to his or her language preference for each webpage that is delivered to the visitor's browser. Secondly, BioWare uses cookies to track a visitor's navigation through its websites.

This helps BioWare understand how its websites are being used.

Most browsers will allow a user to refuse cookies. Check your browser's options for this feature. However, if you set your browser to refuse cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features of BioWare's websites.

If you have a user ID, then BioWare may collect information about your use of the features and services of its websites (whether or not you provide your user ID on each visit) and BioWare may associate this information with your personal information. If a visitor does not have a user ID but does permit cookies, then BioWare only has the means to track use of its websites by that visitor but BioWare has no means to determine who that visitor is. Regardless of the information BioWare collects from the use of its websites, BioWare will only use this information for the limited purposes set out in this Privacy Policy.

Other technologies used include clear GIFs and IP address logging. Clear GIFs (a.k.a. web bugs, beacons or tags) are small graphic images placed on a web page, web-based document, or in an e-mail message. Clear GIFs are invisible to the user because they are typically very small (only 1-by-1 pixel) and the same color as the background of the web page, document or e-mail message. We do not use clear GIFs to collect personal information about you. However, we may use clear GIFs capture statistical usage information for our web pages, features or other elements on a web page. We may correlate this information to a user to personalize user experience and for statistical analysis of user experiences on our web pages. 

### Uses of Information

BioWare will only make one or more of the following uses of your personal information:

  * Analyse personal information and other data in order to enhance BioWare's websites, software, games and services;
  * Use personal information for the purpose for which it was provided and certain other activities which are reasonably ancillary to such purpose. For example, if you send us an e-mail with a question or comment, BioWare will use your e-mail address to respond to you. Further, BioWare may store your e-mail and e-mail address and a copy of our response for future reference;
  * Use email addresses provided to BioWare to provide to you information about future BioWare games and other products and services notwithstanding that the e-mail address may have been provided for a different purpose; and
  * BioWare may also use and disclose personal information that is relevant to a legal proceeding or as permitted or required by law.



In the event BioWare sells or transfers ownership or control of any or all of its services, BioWare reserves the right to transfer and disclose your personal information to that party. However, BioWare will require that party to agree that they will be similarly bound by the provisions of this Privacy Policy and that they will only use your personal information as BioWare is similarly entitled under this Privacy Policy.
