# Privacy Policy - Biofaces - Bring Nature Closer

What is the privacy policy?

Privacy Policy defines the treatment given by BIOFACES to the personal information provided by users of BIOFACES resources and services.

Collected Information

BIOFACES collects the following personal information as visitors register as new users:

Login ( to Access BIOFACES )  
Password ( to Access BIOFACES )

and others

Use of information

BIOFACES uses this information to:  
Identify users at the website (through login and password).   
Present the author’s profile in case they have content published on the website.  
Determine how much each section or service is accessed so as to improve the services provided.

BIOFACES receives and automatically saves information about users’ visits to the website in its servers, including IP address, BIOFACES cookies and accessed pages.

BIOFACES will not sell, share or rent users’ personal information to any third party under any circumstance. Nevertheless, BIOFACES reserves the right to provide this information in response to lawsuits or in case of suspected violation of BIOFACES Terms of Use.

Use of cookies

Cookies are small files which usually contain a single anonymous identifier, sent to users by BIOFACES and stored at its computer. BIOFACES uses cookies to identify and authenticate users at the moment they access the site. Anonymous (non-registered) users may also receive cookies so that BIOFACES can estimate the site’s audience.

Users may configure their navigator to accept or reject all the cookies or to be told when a cookie is sent to them. As this is done in a different way by each navigator, users should resort to their navigators for help in order to know how to modify their preferences concerning the cookies. If users reject all the cookies (not recommended), they will not be able to use the resources and services from BIOFACES which require identification such as sections for content publishing, etc. 

How to consult, edit or exclude personal information on BIOFACES 

Users having registered and been identified on BIOFACES may at any time consult, edit or exclude their personal information through the “My profile” section. If they want to completely exclude any personal information on BIOFACES, users have to contact BIOFACES and request their register cancellation.  

Information Security

Users’ and subscribers’ information is protected by a password for security and privacy reasons. This is why the BIOFACES access password is individual and secret. BIOFACES will never request your password through e-mail or telephone. 

Alterations to Privacy Policy 

BIOFACES may alter this privacy policy as it sees fit. Thus, users are recommended to visit this page regularly.
