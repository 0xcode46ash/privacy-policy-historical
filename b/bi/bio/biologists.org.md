Personal information may for instance include your name, postal address, email address and/or telephone number.

### **2\. Use of your information**

2.1 We take significant steps to protect user privacy.

However, once we have received your personal information we utilise strict procedures to protect the security of your personal information.

2.2 Any personal information gathered by or supplied to us via the Website will be used in accordance with this Privacy Policy, in accordance with your wishes as indicated to us and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998.
