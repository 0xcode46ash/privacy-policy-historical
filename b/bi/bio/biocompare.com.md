Biocompare offers free electronic newsletters to users. Biocompare gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by replying to a newsletter and typing unsubscribe in the subject box. Users can also subscribe to the life science newsletters at the time of registration. Biocompare delivers newsletters, marketing and product offerings via e-mail to only registered recipients.

Biocompare offers contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. At a minimum, the required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the user must answer mandatory survey questions about a range of other personal data. The information gathered in this manner is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Biocompare may divulge this information to a third party, provided the user gives express consent. Conditions which biocompare will disclose this information are when a user may expressly choose to receive additional information from the contest sponsor, in which case the user's personally identifiable information is divulged to the advertiser. All information about each contest is clearly posted during the event. All contests and sweepstakes are conducted in full accordance with laws of the United States of America.
