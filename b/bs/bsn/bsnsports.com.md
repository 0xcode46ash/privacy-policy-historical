## Information Collected By

We collect two types of information from users of the web site (the "Site") and the services offered on the Site: personal information as described below; and non-personal information such as information about traffic patterns on the Site (for example, how many users log on to the Site on a daily basis).

We have enabled Google Analytics. In addition to enabling Google Analytics, we have enabled additional Google Analytics Advertising Features such as Remarketing with Google Analytics, and Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting. By enabling these advertising features, we enable Google Analytics to collect data about your traffic via Google advertising cookies and anonymous identifiers, in addition to data collected through a standard Google Analytics implementation.

## Personal Information

Some personal information, including, but not limited to, name, age, postal address, e-mail address, and telephone number may be collected when ordering a product or requesting information. There may be pages throughout the Site where users may be requested to submit third party information. For example, if a user orders a gift online and wants to send it directly to the recipient, the user will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of information we may request include, but may not be limited to, the third party's name, address and telephone number.

Similarly, when you enter or respond to a contest, survey, sweepstakes or other promotion, we may ask for your name, address and e-mail address and/or other personal information. When you order a product or service through the Site, we may ask you for your name, address and e-mail address and/or other personal information. Credit card information may be required to process your request.

## How We Use Your Personal Information

BSN SPORTS uses the information collected, including personally identifiable information, to better understand your needs and provide you with better products and services. We may use your information to communicate to you, to update you on products, services and benefits, to personalize the Site for you, to contact you for market research and/or to provide you with marketing information, newsletters, or other information. BSN SPORTS may use third party information to ship product, to confirm delivery and to provide such third party with information regarding BSN SPORTS’ promotional programs.

BSN SPORTS may share personal information with our affiliates, business successors, business associates, technical consultants, third party auditors and other third parties. We work with several third party vendors who make our Site available, enhance its functionality, provide associated services and/or who deal with users in processing orders and delivering content, samples, products, services, gifts and prizes. Please note that we reserve the right to transfer your personally identifiable information and other information to our business associates, successors in business and purchasers of Site assets.

Information obtained through the Site may be intermingled with and used in conjunction with information obtained through sources other than the Site, including both offline and online sources.

It is not our policy to use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described in this Privacy Policy without providing you or the third party a way to opt out or otherwise prohibit unrelated uses.

## On-line Purchases

The Site uses various order forms for users to request information and order BSN SPORTS products. We collect contact information (such as name, mailing address and/or e-mail address), and when appropriate, financial information (such as your credit card number and its expiration date) to process requests or purchases. Contact information from an order form may be used to fulfill orders, to contact users regarding their order and for other purposes, such as to provide company information. Collected credit card information is used to process requests for products and services, and will not be shared with third parties that are not involved with the transaction. When credit card information is transmitted, we use industry standard, SSL (secure socket layer) encryption.
