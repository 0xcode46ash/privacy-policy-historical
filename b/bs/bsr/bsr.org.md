# Privacy Policy | BSR

BSR is committed to your right to privacy and to the ethical use of information online. We adhere strictly to the following privacy practices.

Last updated on April 2013: Added information about the BSR Conference.

### No release of personally identifiable information to third parties

We do not rent, sell, give, exchange, or otherwise share personally identifiable information with other individuals or organizations.

### Personally identifiable information is collected only on a voluntary basis

Personally identifiable information such your name, postal address, telephone number, or credit card number are collected only if you "opt in" by choosing to give us this information on a voluntary basis by registering to receive products or services.

### We do collect "aggregate data," that is, group data with no personal identifiers

We use this aggregate data to help us understand how the site is being used and to improve its usability, and to enhance the quality and availability of products and services we offer. We also, with your explicit permission, use aggregate data from online surveys you choose to fill out for research and publication purposes. Once again, this is aggregate data only; individuals or firms are not identified in any such research or publication.

### How we use the information

Personally identifiable information you choose to give us will only be used to:

  * Process membership applications
  * Process billing and orders for products/services you choose to purchase on our site
  * Send you product information and occasional special offers or announcements from select BSR partners. BSR assures that members who "opt-in" will receive no more than 3 special communications a month.



We also collect data that helps us identify the time, date, Internet location, and system information you use during your purchase. This information will assist us in the event of fraud against your credit card.

We will only use the information you give us on the website for the purposes described in this privacy policy.

### Cookies

We do not use cookies to collect information about you. We do use temporary or session cookies to help you navigate our site, and when you are engaged in a purchase to help us fulfill your order.

### Links

We encourage our users to be aware of when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each site they visit. BSR's privacy statement applies only to information collected by our website.

### BSR Conference
