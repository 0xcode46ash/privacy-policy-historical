This notice applies to all information collected or submitted on the Bsafe Online websites. On some pages, you may order products, make requests, or register to receive materials. The types of personal information collected at these pages are: 

On some pages, you may submit other people's email addresses. For example, if you order the reporting option and want it sent to an accountability partner, you would submit their email address. There are also pages where you have the option to recommend a friend be notified of our services via e-mail. 

**The Way We Use Information:**

We use the information you provide about yourself when placing an order only to complete that order. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the extent necessary to complete that order. 

We use return email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. 

We use aggregate information to better design our website and to share with our Partners (those who have an agreement with us to promote our products and services). For example, we may inform a Partner that a specified number of individuals visited our website from a link on their site; and, of those, how many signed-up. To commission the sign-ups we make available the total number of signups by date, as well as individual names for the partner's audit purposes. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

**Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:**

Protecting the privacy of children is especially important to us. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 18, and no part of our website is structured to attract anyone under 18. 

**How You May Access Or Correct Your Information**

Customers may access all your personally identifiable information which we collect online and maintain by signing-in to the "My Account" section of our secure website. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. From here you may correct factual errors in your online personal information. To protect your privacy and security, we will also take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections to our secure site data.
