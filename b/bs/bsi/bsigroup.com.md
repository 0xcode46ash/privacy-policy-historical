## Information gathered by us when you browse the BSI Website

Although we will do all that we reasonably can to ensure that availability of our website will be uninterrupted and error free, we cannot guarantee this due to the nature of the internet. The website may also be down from time to time to allow us to maintain or repair it, or to change the services that we offer.

When you visit the BSI website to browse information that it contains, you do so anonymously unless you choose to provide us with information about yourself. If you do nothing during your visit but browse through the web site - reading pages, viewing images, for example - we will gather and store certain information about your visit automatically. This information does not identify you personally.

Information gathered automatically is used for only two purposes: site management and, in the case of suspected unauthorised activity, for law enforcement and possible criminal prosecution (see Your Use of the BSI Website in our [Terms and Conditions](https://web.archive.org/en-GB/about-bsi/legal/terms-and-conditions/).)

The BSI website automatically logs visitor information from which summary statistics are created. We use the summary statistics to help us make our site more useful to visitors, such as assessing what information is of most interest to visitors, as well as for other purposes such as determining the site's technical design specifications and identifying system performance or problem areas.

The following are representative of the types of information automatically collected and stored about your visit:

  * the internet domain and Internet Protocol (IP) address from which you access our website; 
  * the type of internet browser and the operating system of the computer you use to access our website; 
  * the date and time of your visit;
  * the pages you visit on our website;
  * if you linked to our website from another one, the address of the other website; 
  * if you linked to our website from a search website, the address of that website and the search term you used;
  * and, mouse clicks, mouse movements and scrolling activity, keystroke information that you voluntarily enter on this website. 



## **Shared Information with other BSI Businesses**

Any information that you may provide to the British Standards division of BSI will not be shared with other BSI businesses within the BSI Group.

Information sent to other BSI businesses may be shared with any other relevant BSI businesses in order to fulfil your information needs about products or services of those other BSI businesses in which you register an interest. Such information may include your contact details (if you have requested us to contact you in this regard).

We will not pass any information to any party outside the BSI Group, although we reserve the right to pass your details to law enforcement agencies if required to do so by applicable law.

If the ownership of BSI is changed, or the assets of BSI are sold we reserve the right to pass your details to the new purchaser, subject to notifying you of this as soon as is reasonably possible in the case of an asset sale.

## Changes to our privacy policy

Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted here although we may choose to email you directly or direct you to an updated policy when you visit our site if the changes are significant.
