B-Side also collects information on the pages you access and other information you may volunteer, such as survey information. 

## Uses of Information

B-Side may make the email addresses and other information collected from B-Side's users available to other organizations. If you supply B-Side with your postal address online, you may, receive mailings from other third party companies involved in the film festivals B-Side covers. These third party companies may use the information that you provide at B-Side to deliver you mailings with offers about goods and services that may be of interest to you. B-Side may use a third party company to distribute B-Side's offers. 

B-Side may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with B-Side's server and to administer B-Side's web site.

B-Side's site's registration form requires users to give B-Side contact information (such as your name and email address) and demographic information (such as your zip code, age, or income level). B-Side uses customer contact information from the registration form to send the user information about B-Side's company and promotional material from some of B-Side's partners. The customer's contact information is also used to contact the user when necessary. Users may choose to opt-out of receiving future mailings. Demographic and profile data may also be collected at B-Side's site. B-Side may use this data to tailor the visitor's experience on B-Side's site, show the visitor content that B-Side thinks you may be interested in, and display content according to your preferences.
