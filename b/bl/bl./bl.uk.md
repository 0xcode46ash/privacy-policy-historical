# Privacy

The purpose of this statement is to inform users of this website what information is collected about them when they visit this site, how this information is used and if it is disclosed.

In common with most websites, the British Library website automatically logs certain information about every request sent to it. This information is used for system administration and for producing usage statistics. Summary statistics are extracted from this data and some of these may be made publicly available, but these do not include information from which individuals could be identified. Relevant subsets of this data may be used as part of investigations of computer misuse involving this site (see also our [guidelines on use](https://web.archive.org/disclaimer.html)). Data may also on occasion be used to enable investigation of technical problems on the website. Otherwise logged information is not passed to any third party except if required by law. 

This site does not currently use cookies for any purpose. 

From time to time we will use electronic forms on this site to gather personal information for purposes directly related to a function or activity of the Library. When we do so we will let you know the purpose for which the information is being collected (including if the information is to be published). 

It is important to appreciate that the British Library website provides extensive links to other independent sites, but this policy applies only to direct use of this website (www.bl.uk). You will need to consult the providers of other websites for information on their policies.
