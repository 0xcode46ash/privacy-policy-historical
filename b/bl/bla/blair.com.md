  |  **BLAIR.COM PRIVACY STATEMENT**

At Blair.com, we know that your online privacy is as important to you as the products, prices and customer service we provide, so we've included this page to explain how we use the information we collect and request, and to provide you with the information you need to feel comfortable while shopping Blair.com. 

| We have created this privacy policy to adhere to the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) Privacy Promise. If you have any questions about it, please call us at 800-821-5744.

**When You Visit Blair.com**

The information we collect helps us to provide a better, more unique shopping experience to each of our customers. For example, we study how all of our customers use the web site so that we can continually update the site and make modifications to suit their needs (the Clearance section of our site is very popular, so we regularly add items to this area). These modifications are based on the shopping patterns of thousands of Blair.com visitors, rather than studying information on a single visitor. We may also collect information regarding your visit to Blair.com so that we can customize the site upon your return and provide you with an even better shopping experience on future visits. 

We do not collect any of your personal information when you visit Blair.com, including your name or e-mail address, unless you provide it to us, and ask us to contact you directly. 

**When You're Asked to Provide Information to Blair.com**

While shopping on the Blair.com site, you may be requested to provide information on certain forms. We use this information to process your order, to contact you regarding your order, or to answer any questions/concerns you might have expressed. 

If you provide us with a mailing address when placing an order, you may receive Blair catalogs that we feel might interest you. We may also provide your name and address to other quality companies whose products you may find of interest. If you would rather not receive offers from other companies, please send your full name, address and customer number to: 

                 Blair Corporation  
                 Mail Preference Service  
                 220 Hickory St.  
                 Warren, PA 16366

Information you include in your personal Blair.com "My Account," such as credit card numbers and friends' addresses, remains in your "My Account" section and is only used to process your order and to make your Blair.com shopping experience quicker and more enjoyable. 

If you provide us with your e-mail address during the order process or when submitting a question, we will only use it to contact you regarding your request or inquiry. **Blair.com customer e-mail addresses are not shared with or sold to any organization unless required by law.**

You may check or change any personal information that you have provided to us by calling customer service at 800-821-5744. 

**When You Sign Up for Blair.com Email Specials**

If you've entered your e-mail address to request Blair.com E-Mail Specials on our home page or on other areas of the Blair.com web site, or have checked the appropriate box on various information forms, you will receive Blair.com E-Mail Specials from time to time. Once you've subscribed to our E-Mail Specials, you will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe to these offers in each e-mail that we send to you. **And again, Blair.com e-mail addresses are not provided to any third party.**

**What You Should Know About Cookies**

A cookie is a tiny bit of information that resides in your web browser. A cookie does not contain any of your personal information, and is only a "trigger" that retrieves your information once you access our site. 

Several examples of how cookies work on our web site will illustrate how we utilize them, and how they can benefit you. For instance, cookies enable us to provide better service to you by maintaining your shopping cart between visits (so that you are not required to enter each of the items again), and by providing special offers when you click on Blair.com promotional banners before beginning your shopping visit. As another example, if you register as a Blair.com shopper on our home page, a cookie will enable you to shop more quickly by not having to re-enter your name and address each time you place an order online. 

On most Internet browsers, the cookie function can be turned off, but by doing so, you will be unable to shop at many Internet sites, including Blair.com. 

**How You Find Out About Updates to Our Privacy Policy**

Occasionally, we make changes to our privacy practices or change the way our website looks and functions. Our Privacy Policy is continually updated to reflect these changes, so you should review this page from time to time for the latest information.
