# Privacy

Our purpose is to provide you with a useful and relevant   
 Internet experience. We collect information from you to aid us in this.  
 

We collect email addresses from visitors who voluntarily   
submit this information for the purpose of receiving updates and   
special offers from us. You may be removed from our mailing list at any   
time by submitting a request for removal. Detailed instructions for   
removal are included in each mailing we send.

Consumer demographic information collected by us through   
registration forms is used only for the purpose of tracking   
aggregate usage data and analyzing the performance of our service. At   
times we may provide aggregate data to third parties. (This means we may tell them that 45% of our visitors are female - but NOT what your names or email addresses are.)

BlackSingles.com may use "cookies" and "IP addresses" for the purpose of   
collecting information about how visitors use our site and to help us   
improve our service to you. This information is sometimes   
called "clickstream" or "click trail" data. We use this information, in   
aggregated form ONLY, to help us estimate our audience size, and to guide us in   
adjusting the site for easier use.

We may collect personal financial information from you including your   
credit card number, phone number and address when you place   
an order. This information is stored securely, transmitted encrypted, and   
is ONLY used in fulfilling your order. It is never shared with anyone   
else.

You can be assured that the individual personal information you provide   
to BlackSingles.com is not disclosed to anyone, at any time, and that   
 information about you is only used as outlined above.

      If you have any concerns or questions, please us at
