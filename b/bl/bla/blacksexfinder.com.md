If there is any information that you do not wish to made available to the public at large, you should not post it in your profile.

If we discover that a minor has joined the site or is viewing the site, we will move to block their access to the best of our ability using technology reasonably available. If you are under the age of 18, you should not access this site. 

**Use of Cookies**

We use “cookies” to identify how individuals use our site and to facilitate modifications and improvements to our site for your benefit. A “cookie” is a small piece of information that is placed on the hard drive of your computer so we can identify you when you access the site. The use of cookies is a common practice on the Internet. You can avoid the use of cookies on your site by disabling all cookies, typically by accessing the Internet options bar on your browser. 

**Security**

blacksexfinder.com takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. NO BACKGROUND SEARCH OF FELONY OR SEXUAL OFFENSE CONVICTIONS IS DONE ON MEMBERS WHO USE THIS SERVICE. PLEASE TAKE APPROPRIATE SAFETY MEASURES TO INCREASE AWARENESS OF POSSIBLE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DATING. When our registration/order process asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example a billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. There is no substitute for using good common sense and acting with caution when communicating with any stranger who wants to meet you. 

**Billing Information**

We do NOT sell, share or give away any information regarding your credit card or other payment source. We do use a third party to process your membership payments, but neither that party nor ourselves provides such information to any third party. We reserve the right to provide such information to any law enforcement officials that make a legally binding request for said information.
