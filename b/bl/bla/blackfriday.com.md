If you decide to engage in these activities with us, we may ask you to provide us with certain personal information about yourself, such as your first and last name, mailing address (including zip code), email address, telephone number and date of birth. When you order products or services, we may also ask you to provide us with your credit card number, expiration date and authentication codes or related information. We may also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Website. Please understand that if you publicly post personal information about yourself (e.g., by communicating with others, reviewing products or restaurants, or submitting media content), this information may be accessible by other consumers and companies and may appear on other websites or web searches, and, therefore, this information could be read, collected, and used by others. For example, if you post your email address along with a public restaurant review, you may receive unsolicited messages. We have no control over who reads your postings or what other Users may do with the information you voluntarily post, so please use caution when posting any personal information.

  * **Cookies.** To facilitate and customize your experience with the Website, we store cookies on your computer. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a User’s computer for record-keeping purposes which contains information about that User. We use cookies to save you time while using the Website, remind us who you are, and track and target User interests in order to provide a customized experience.
