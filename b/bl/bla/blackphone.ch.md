# Privacy Policy - Blackphone

Our business is to make and sell privacy-oriented smartphones and the software which runs on them. We take this very seriously. The physical security of our servers, networks, and equipment is equally as important as data security. That is why we own, control, and when necessary, custom-build our own equipment as well as employ the strictest security measures. The emphasis on privacy and security is what we do best.

Accepting payments may require us to collect some very basic personal data such as email addresses, shipping addresses, and card information. This payment information is only shared with our payment processor, and only to complete the transaction and get you your phone. We do not hold your credit card information. We want to hold the least amount of data as possible.

Blackphone stores minimal detail from its web server and other logs. Whenever possible we disable the collection of identifying information. We delete logs as soon as reasonably possible. We turn the logging level on our systems to log only protocol-related errors. Our goal is to have nothing to turn over or disclose to any third party.

Our staff and technical infrastructure are in multiple locations around the world. We aim to be conversant in the local rules and regulations for each jurisdiction, as they pertain to our obligations to respond to subpoenas or other requests for information about our customers or activities. Whenever possible, if such requests are received we will disclose the details of those requests to any affected customers, even if we believe we had no data responsive to the request.

You may notice that the pages on our main web site pull in javascript files from a third party. This allows our web developers and salespeople to know which pages are being looked at, and how to make information easier to find for our enterprise customers. In discussions with the third party, we are convinced that the information being used is the minimum possible, and that it is being handled with the appropriate care.

Your privacy is dependent on the proper handling of your personal information. We will never sell this data or give access to unauthorized third parties. If requested, you can be assured we will delete your information completely from our records. We will update the accuracy and currency of this privacy statement as needed. We want it to reflect our goals and aspirations to help you. We also want it to accurately describe what we can and cannot do.

Maintaining top-notch security is a group effort and Blackphone encourages independent security researchers to help us spot potential issues. To recognize such efforts and the important role they play in keeping the Blackphone ecosystem safe we offer a [ bounty for reporting qualifying security vulnerabilities](https://bugcrowd.com/blackphone).
