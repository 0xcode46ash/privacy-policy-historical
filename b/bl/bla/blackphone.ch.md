For marketing and sales purposes, you may notice that the pages on our web site pull in JavaScript files from a third party. This allows our web developers and salespeople to know which pages are being looked at, and how to make information easier to find for our enterprise customers. The information being tracked is stored only on our servers and is not shared with third parties. Information that is tracked by this method is based on IP address and browser-provided information, to analyze:

  * Page visits 
  * Returning visits 
  * Referrals/Campaigns 
  * Abandonment 
  * Location 
  * Browser/Device Information 



We use this information in aggregate to make improvements to our website and improve our visitorsâ€™ experiences. In addition, we do collect information using online form submissions: if you submit a request via our website, we may collect any personally identifying information you volunteer in addition to the standard browsing-related information outlined above.
