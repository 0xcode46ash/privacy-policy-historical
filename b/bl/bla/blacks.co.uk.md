## Security

At Blacks, we realise how important it is to securely store any information that you provide us. Our site (blacks.co.uk) currently uses high-level Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the most advanced security software currently available for online transactions. You can therefore rest assured that we take the security of your payment and personal details very seriously. We may vary this in the future if we feel you will benefit from greater security whilst using our Website.

You can tell whether a webpage is secure as 'https' will replace the 'http' at the front of the www.blacks.co.uk in your browser address window, also a small locked padlock will appear in the bottom bar of your browser window.

While we currently use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also protect your information off-line. All of your information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer services representative) are granted access to your personal information. The servers on which we store your personal information are kept in a secure environment.  


## Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™

To give you even more confidence in shopping online with blacks.co.uk, we have introduced Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™. These services enhance your existing credit/debit card accounts against unauthorized use when you shop with us. To use this service, you must first register with the bank or other organisation that issued your card.

[ Visit the Verified by Visa website](http://www.visaeu.com/iusevisa/shoppingonline.html)  
[Visit the Mastercard® SecureCode™ website](http://www.mastercard.com/uk/cardholderservices/securecode/index.html)

Once you have registered and created your own private password with your card issuer, you will be automatically prompted at the checkout when the card is being processed to provide this password each time you make a purchase.

Please note: Your Verified by Visa and Mastercard® SecureCode™ password is related to your credit/debit cards and is not your blacks.co.uk customer account password. Blacks.co.uk does not have access to your Verified by Visa or Mastercard® SecureCode™ password.  


## Phising

Phising is the practice of tricking someone into giving confidential information. Examples include falsely claiming to be a legitimate company when sending an email to a user, in an attempt to get the user to send private information that will be used for identity theft and fraud.

Blacks will never ask you to send any personal details via email. If we require such details, for security reasons we will ask you to contact us by telephone. Should you receive an email claiming to be from Blacks, Blacks Leisure Group and/or The Outdoor Group Limited requesting this kind of information please do not respond but contact us immediately.
