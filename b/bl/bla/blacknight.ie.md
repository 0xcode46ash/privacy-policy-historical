# Privacy Policy - Privacy Policy: Blacknight Solutions

Privacy Policy

We are strongly committed to protecting the private information of our customers. We will not send you unwanted e-mail messages or junk mail, and your details will not be passed to any organisation beyond Blacknight Solutions without your explicit permission. 

However, we will use e-mail to send you messages about outstanding orders, renewals and service issues. We may also use e-mail to keep you up to date with news about your current services, as well as anything you show an interest in. 

  
Please note that in the process of registering for a domain name Internic and each registry publish basic information relating to every domain name on the internet. This information includes the name, address and email address supplied by the administrative contact, the technical contact and the billing contact. This information is then freely available on the internet.  


The IE domain registry does not publish anything but the most basic information, so your email address is not visible.  


As domain name owners e-mail addresses are made public in the WHOIS query tool and are included in Bulk WHOIS data, there is a potential for misuse of this publicly available information. If you have received unsolicited emails (spam) soon after registering a new domain name it is most likely that the sender has "harvested" your details from this publicly available information. In this situation we recommend that you contact the e-mail sender directly and asked to be removed from their e-mail list.  


If you have any queries regarding our handling of your personal data feel free toï¿½ **[contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20050305015836id_/http%3A//www.blacknight.ie/contact-us.0.html)**.
