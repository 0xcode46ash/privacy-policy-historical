# Privacy Policy - BLACKHAWK!

## Our Commitment To Privacy

BLACKHAWK!® respects your privacy and has created this policy to let you know we take your privacy seriously. We are particularly sensitive to privacy issues on the Internet. To better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our homepage and at every point where personally identifiable information may be requested.

## The Information We Collect:

In general, you can browse BLACKHAWK!’s website without revealing who you are or any personal information. We are, however, able to determine your IP address. We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to administer our Web site, to measure the use of our Web site and to improve the content of our Web site. In short we use your IP to gather aggregate demographic information. There are a few places where we give you an opportunity to provide us your personal information.

The types of personal information collected at these pages are: Name, Address, Email address, Phone number, and Credit/Debit Card Information (etc.). On some pages, you can submit information about other people. For example, if you order a BLACKHAWK! gift online and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will need to submit the recipient's address. In this circumstance, the types of personal information collected are: Name, Address, and Phone Number (etc.) Depending upon the activity, some of the information we ask you to provide is identified as mandatory and some as voluntary. If you do not provide the mandatory data with respect to a particular activity, you will not be able to engage in that activity.
