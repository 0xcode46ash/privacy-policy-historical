Accessing the Site. When you request a page within the Site, our web servers automatically recognize your domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed the Site. We may provide this information to other companies and individuals to perform functions on behalf the Site. This information may be used to examine our traffic in aggregate and to investigate misuse of the Site or to cooperate with law enforcement.

Cookies. From time to time, the Site or its advertisers may send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a Web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other Web sites. Cookies do not damage your system. We use cookies to identify which areas of the Site you have visited or customized, so the next time you visit those pages they may be readily accessible. Along with our advertisers, we may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you've seen an advertisement and to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on our site. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at our Site and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. 

We will disclose Your Personally Identifiable Information and/or an IP address, when required by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

  

  * 1\. Conform to the law or comply with legal process served on us, 
  

  * 2\. Protect and defend the rights or property of the Site, or visitors to the Site and related properties, 
  

  * 3\. Identify persons who may be violating the law, the Site's Terms and Conditions, the rights of third parties, or otherwise misusing the Site or its related properties, 
  

  * 4\. Cooperate with the investigations of purported unlawful activities.
  



In addition, we reserve the right to transfer all such information (i.e., either personally identifiable or not) in connection with the sale of all or part of our capital stock or assets.

We may allow third parties to advertise on the Site. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the business and privacy practices of these other sites. We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave the Site and to read the legal notices and privacy policies of each and every website you visit.

We have reasonable security measures in place and technologies to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of your information under our control but we cannot assure that Your Personally Identifiable Information or non-personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Policy.

We make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate business purposes. We will ask that you identify yourself and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. To access, correct or delete your personal information, contact: [privacy@blackboardeats.com](mailto:privacy@blackboardeats.com).

We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we decide to materially or substantively change this Privacy Policy (i.e, change our treatment of Your Personally Identifiable Information), we will notify you by posting a clear and conspicuous notice of these changes on our website and in this Privacy Policy. If you would like to be notified by e-mail if and when material changes are made to this Privacy Policy, please opt in to receiving such e-mail notifications by contacting us at [privacy@blackboardeats.com](mailto:privacy@blackboardeats.com).
