  * Analyze the logs with web tools looking at usage patterns and trends to better the site layout.
  * Store the email we receive and delete the unnecessary ones.
  * Store snail mail for a few months, then shred or destroy it when no longer necessary for accounting purposes.
  * We may use the information to solicit our customers regarding new products or services offered by us.



### What we **don't** do:

  * Sell the web log files or e-mail addresses to third parties except that we may sell the web log files, e-mail addresses and other customer information in connection with any actual sale, merger, transfer or exchange of our business.
