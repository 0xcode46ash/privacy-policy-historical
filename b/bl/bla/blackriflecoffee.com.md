info@blackriflecoffee.com

### PURPOSE OF THIS POLICY

Federal law requires us to inform the users of our website of the personal information we collect, why we collect it, how we protect it, and how we may share it.

Last updated May 1, 2014

## PERSONAL INFORMATION (PI)

### WHAT PI DO WE COLLECT?

Depending on the service you are accessing, you may be asked to provide any of the following information at various times:

  * Name
  * Email address
  * Contact phone number
  * Cell phone number
  * Address
  * Age/year of birth
  * Gender
  * Social Security number
  * Drivers license number
  * Credit card account info
  * Demographic information
  * Military and veteran status
  * Education history
  * Citizenship



### WHY DO WE COLLECT PI?

We request this information to successfully deliver the services you are requesting and to provide you with a more personalized online experience. Your information may also be collected on behalf of third parties who have contractual exclusive use of your information for their business purposes.

### WHEN DO WE COLLECT PI?

  * When you fill out forms
  * When you request information
  * When you submit an order for products, services, or campaign/project contributions
  * When we acquire information about you from a third party that has obtained your permission to share



### GENERAL USE OF PI

This policy may be updated from time to time. We recommend reviewing this policy each time you use the company’s website to see the most current policy available.

The company may use PI to provide promotional offers, education services, or to follow up on your information requests. This may take the form of email advertising, telephone marketing to your provided telephone number, direct mail marketing, online banner advertising, and package stuffers, among other possible uses. Additional details are provided in a later section of this policy.

### EMAIL UNSUBSCRIBE

By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to be contacted in accordance with the terms of this policy.

We use PI to provide other businesses promotional offers by email to individuals. We may maintain separate email lists for varying purposes. If you receive an email from us and wish to end your subscription, follow the instructions at the end of each email to unsubscribe from that particular list.

This process impacts only the future delivery of emails disseminated by the company on its own behalf. You may still receive emails sent on behalf of third parties, and your personal information may still be shared with third parties for use in offline marketing and data appends, including email appends.

Also, unsubscribing from this company’s emails will not automatically unsubscribe you from any third party business associates and licensees of the data. Since third parties maintain separate databases from the company, you will need to unsubscribe from each source individually, if desired.

## COOKIES, WEB BEACONS, AND OTHER INFORMATION COLLECTED USING TECHNOLOGY

### COOKIES

Cookies are a feature on your browser software. If enabled, we may write cookies that may store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of the pages of this website. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features appeal the most to you and what content you may have viewed on past visits. When you visit this site again, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. We may use cookies to do the following: keep track of the number of return visits to this website, deliver specific content to you based on your interests or past viewing history, save your password for ease of access to our website, and/or accumulate and report aggregate, statistical information on website usage.

You can disable cookies, although the website may not function properly for you if you choose to do so. Notwithstanding any other provision in this policy, in visiting this website, a third party may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. To trigger these cookies, we may pass an encrypted or “hashed” identifier corresponding to your email address to a web advertising partner, who may place a cookie on your computer. No personally identifiable information is in or connected to these cookies.

### GOOGLE DART COOKIES (AND OPT-OUT)

Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to serve ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to you based on your visit to this site and other sites on the internet. For more information about Google’s use of the DART cookie or opting out of its use, visit the Google ad and network privacy policy at [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy) or [http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads/](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ads).

### OTHER THIRD-PARTY COOKIES OPT-OUT

Please go to <http://www.privacychoice.org/companies> or [http:/aboutads.info/choices](http://www.blackriflecoffee.com/aboutads.info/choices). We do not own or control these sites, but they provide a cookie opt-out service for member advertisers.

### WEB BEACONS

A web beacon is a programming code that can be used to display an image on a web page. However, it can also be used to transfer your unique user identification to a database and associate you with previously acquired information about an individual in a database. This allows the company to track certain websites you visit. Web beacons are used to track online behavioral habits for marketing purposes to determine products or services you may be interested in. In addition to using web beacons on web pages, the company also uses web beacons in email messages sent to individuals listed in the company’s database.

### IP ADDRESSES

The company automatically tracks certain information based upon your behavior on this website. We may use this information to do internal research on our users’ demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect, and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our website or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our website or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. Your Internet Protocol (“IP”) is a unique internet address which is assigned to you by your Internet Service Provider (“ISP”). For local area network (“LAN”), DSL, or cable modem users, an IP address may be permanently assigned to a particular computer. IP addresses are automatically logged by web servers, collecting information about a user’s traffic patterns. While the IP address does not identify an individual by name, it may, with the cooperation of the ISP, be used to locate and identify an individual using the internet. Your IP address can, however, reveal what geographic area you are connecting from or which ISP you are using. Finally, other websites you visit also have IP addresses, and we may collect the IP addresses of those websites and their pages.

### COMPUTER PROFILES

The company may also collect and accumulate other anonymous data which will help us understand and analyze the internet experience of our visitors. For instance, the company may accumulate visitor data relating to referring domain names, the type of browsers used, operating system software, screen resolutions, color capabilities, browser plug-ins, language settings, cookie preferences, search engine keywords, and JavaScript enablement. When you provide us with Personally Identifiable Information (“PII”), we are able to use such visitor data to identify you.

### DATA ANALYSIS

Data analysis technology may be employed from time to time if used by a client of the company.

### NEW TECHNOLOGY

The use of technology on the internet, including cookies and web beacons, is rapidly developing. As a result, the company strongly encourages individuals to revisit this policy for any updates regarding its use of new technology.

### CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT

This website is not intended for use by children. If you are under the age of 18, do not use this website. The company will never knowingly collect any personal information from anyone under the age of 18. If we obtain actual knowledge that we have collected personal information about someone under the age of 18, that information will immediately be deleted from our database. This policy has been designed to comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”).

## ADVERTISING AND MARKETING

### EMAIL MESSAGES

In certain commercial email messages sent by the Company, an advertiser’s name will appear in the “From:” line, but hitting the “Reply” button will cause a reply email to be sent to the company. The company only sends emails to individuals who have agreed on the website to receive correspondence from the company or to individuals who have agreed on a third-party website to receive correspondence from third parties. As such, we do not send unsolicited email messages. You may unsubscribe from these messages at any time by following the instructions outlined earlier in this policy.

### TARGETED ADVERTISING

The company may use PI to target advertising to an individual. When an individual is using the internet, the company uses other information to associate an individual with that person’s PI, and the company attempts to show advertising for products and services in which the person has expressed an interest, in surveys and otherwise. The company may, at its discretion, target advertising by using email, direct mail, telephones, cell phones, and other means of communication to provide promotional offers.

### TELEMARKETING

The company may use PI to advertise, directly or indirectly, to individuals using direct mail marketing or telemarketing using telephones and cell phones. You may have your telephone number or cell phone number listed on a state or federal do not call registry.

By registering and/or using this website, you are waiving your rights and privileges under these laws and expressly giving permission to the company and any agent of the company the right to contact you by telephone or cell phone, and you agree that such an act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR § 310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”).

Further, if you reside outside of the United States, by registering and using this website, you acknowledge that the processing of your individual information may involve the transfer of such individual information from within or outside the European Economic Area (“EEA”) to countries within or outside the EEA, whose data protection regulation may not be as stringent as that within the European Union. We may use individual information to provide the services you’ve requested, including services that display customized content and advertising.

### WIRELESS ADDRESSES

If the email address you provide to the company is a wireless email or text address, you agree to receive messages at such address from the company or its business associates (unless and until you have elected not to receive such messages by following the instructions in the unsubscribe portion of this policy). You understand that your wireless carrier’s standard rates apply to these messages. You represent that you are the owner or authorized user of the wireless device on which messages will be received and that you are authorized to approve the applicable charges.

### STORAGE OF PI

The company operates secure data networks protected by an industry standard firewall, encrypted and password protection systems. Our security and privacy policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized individuals have access to the information provided by our customers. Notwithstanding such measures, the company cannot guarantee that its security measures will prevent its computers from being illegally accessed, and the individual information on them stolen or altered.

### OTHER USES OF PI

The company may also use your PI in the following ways:

  * Third party offers
  * Marketing
  * Co-sponsored offerings
  * Service providers
  * Aggregate statistics (anonymized)
  * Complying with legal process
  * Order fulfillment
  * Data summary (anonymized)
  * Sell to third party companies for their marketing use.



### BUSINESS TRANSITIONS

In the event the company goes through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, as well as in the event of a bankruptcy, assignment for benefit of creditors or receivership, your PI may be disclosed and will likely be among the assets transferred. You will be notified via prominent notice on our website for 30 days of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information. The company further reserves the right to disclose, transfer, or sell your personal information to companies who are affiliated with the company, in the company’s sole discretion.

### LINKS

The company’s website and email messages may sometimes contain hypertext links to the websites of third parties. The company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such other websites. Linked websites may contain links to websites maintained by third parties. Such links are provided for your convenience and reference only. The company does not operate or control in any respect any information, software, products, or services available on such third party websites. The inclusion of a link to a website does not imply any endorsement of the services or the site, its contents, or its sponsoring organization.

### FOREIGN USE OF THE WEBSITE

To the extent that you are accessing the website while domiciled outside of the United States, you acknowledge that the PI you are providing the company is stored in the United States and therefore consent to the transfer of information to and storage of the information outside of your domiciled country and in the United States. The United States' privacy laws differ from other countries' privacy laws.
