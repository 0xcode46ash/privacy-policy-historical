### BlackVoices.com Privacy Policy

**Information Collection**

BlackVoices.com is dedicated to providing visitors with a highly interactive and personalized experience, while at the same time protecting users from any unexpected use of personally identifiable information (your name, e-mail address, snail mail address, telephone number). Like other Web publishers, we collect information from users in order to deliver more individualized content and advertising to them, but we do so only within the guidelines in this policy.

**How we gather information from users.**

BlackVoices.com gathers information you provide to us when you register for access to certain portions of our site. We also gather information you provide to us when you participate in interactive areas of our site, including sweepstakes and contests, voting and polling activities, message boards and chat rooms. Also, in connection with our current and planned electronic commerce services, you may be asked to provide information, including credit card information, necessary to complete a transaction you have requested. In each case, some of the demographic information we request will be identified as "optional" during the registration process. You may change or update your registration information at any time by pointing your Web browser at http://www.blackvoices.com/join/.

BlackVoices.com also employs "cookie" technology to improve your navigation through the site and to allow customization of the site according to your individual preferences. Once you register with us, a string of information (the cookie) is passed to your web browser and stored on your computer. This cookie identifies you as a unique, registered user and holds your preferences as you have identified them and other information from your visit. The cookie stores your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit and granting you certain access privileges. Cookies may also be used to control the number of times you encounter particular advertisements while visiting our sites. You can set your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but if you do you may be unable to access certain portions of the site or may be asked to re-enter your user name and password, and we will not be able to customize the site's features according to your preferences. 

Like most web sites, BlackVoices.com also logs IP addresses, or the electronic location of your computer on the Internet.

**What we do with the information we collect.**

The information you share with us may be used in several ways. Typically, during your visit to our sites, we will use your registration and demographic information to deliver targeted editorial or advertising content we think might interest you. 

We may also combine information about you, your computer, and your usage patterns with similar information obtained from other users to create profiles of BlackVoices.com users as a whole and to identify their preferences in content and advertising. This aggregated information occasionally may be shared with our advertisers and business partners as well as used by BlackVoices.com and other Tribune Company affiliates. 

We will use personally identifiable information to communicate with you about: your registration and customization preferences; our [**Terms of Service**](http://www.blackvoices.com/about/bv_tos.html) and privacy policies; services and products offered by BlackVoices.com and other Tribune Company affiliates; and other important information. We may also communicate with you about changes and improvements to BlackVoices.com and about sweepstakes or promotions we are conducting. 

Personal information collected by BlackVoices.com may also be used for other purposes as determined by BlackVoices.com. For example, to inform users of offline events or special promotions available to BlackVoices.com members only. Also, from time to time we or our advertising and promotional partners may call to your attention products, special offers and unique content we believe might be of interest to you. However, if you prefer not to receive direct communications from our advertisers, you will be given an opportunity to decline before you provide us any information. If you decline each time you provide us with the information, you will not receive communications directly from our advertisers utilizing information collected from our site.

Personal information collected by BlackVoices.com may also be used for site administration and troubleshooting and to process e-commerce transactions, contest entries and other matters you initiate. 

**Affiliated and linked sites.**

BlackVoices.com expects its partners, advertisers and affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. Be aware, however, that our promotional partners, advertisers, sponsors, third-party Internet sites, and content providers accessible through our site may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. During your visit to our site you may link to (or view as part of a frame that includes BlackVoices.com content) certain content that is actually created by a third party. BlackVoices.com is not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties. Users should check the applicable privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through co-branded, affiliated, framed or linked sites.

While on our site, you may occasionally receive cookies from our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties. The placement of cookies by third-party servers is common on the Internet. BlackVoices.com does not control the use of these cookies or the resulting information; therefore, these cookies are not subject to BlackVoices.com's privacy policy. 

Finally, you should be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information (e.g., user name, e-mail address, or other messages) on message boards or in chat areas of BlackVoices.com , that information can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond the control of BlackVoices.com.

**Children**

BlackVoices.com encourages parents and guardians to spend time online with their children and to participate in the interactive activities offered on BlackVoices.com . Kids under 13: ask your parents before submitting or posting any information on BlackVoices.com . BlackVoices.com does not knowingly solicit personal information from children under the age of 13 without parental consent. In the event that we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as is practical.

**Policy Changes.**

The foregoing policy is effective as of October. 12, 1999. BlackVoices.com reserves the right to change this policy at any time. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the sites following the posting of changes to these terms will mean you accept those changes.
