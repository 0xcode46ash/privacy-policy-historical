# Privacy Policy - BLOCKBUSTER Express

## Last Updated: November 20, 2009

The New Release LP (a subsidiary of NCR) respects your privacy and strives to protect the Personal Information we may collect when you interact with us. This policy describes how we gather, use, and disclose that information.

**Definition of "Personal Information"**   
A person's name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, gender, social security number or equivalent, photograph, and other information that identifies him or her, are all Personal Information, as is information concerning a person's education, employment, interests, or which is necessary to complete a requested transaction or service (such as credit card or other credit information).

**What Personal Information We Collect, And Why**  
When you interact with us, such as when you rent or purchase products or services at our kiosks or through our website; call, email, or write us; or participate in an online survey, we may ask you to provide your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, contact preferences, billing information (including your credit card number), and information relating to a support or service issue. We may also ask you to provide information such as your age, gender, and occupation to gain a better understanding of you so we can provide personal service and for marketing purposes. We may use cameras when you rent or purchase through our kiosks to detect and prosecute fraud and to meet other legal obligations.

We seek to deliver the highest level of customer service, and knowing Personal Information about you helps us to improve your experience with us. Some Personal Information is necessary for billing or other legal purposes. We may also collect Personal Information to help detect and prevent fraud. We only collect Personal Information in accordance with applicable laws and fair methods.

**Sharing or Disclosing Personal Information**   
We will use appropriate physical, technical, and procedural measures to safeguard Personal Information and reduce the risk of its disclosure or use in violation of this privacy policy. We will not sell, rent or lease Personal Information to third parties, except in conjunction with a sale of substantially all our business to which the Personal Information relates.

We may disclose Personal Information to our subsidiaries and related companies, and to certain third parties, including service providers or subcontractors necessary to support the uses described in this policy, but such disclosure will always be consistent with the purposes for which the Personal Information was provided. When we transmit Personal Information to a third party, we contractually require that party to employ appropriate safeguards in connection with its use of the Information, and to use it only for the purposes we state. In some instances, Personal Information may be transferred outside the country in which it was gathered, but we will not do so without assuring that suitable safeguards are in place.

With your permission, we may send marketing information to you, such as discount offers and information about new product offerings. We may also send you marketing information on behalf of one of our business partners about products or services they provide that may be of interest to you. In doing so, we will not share your Personal Information with those partners.

We may use or disclose Personal Information as required to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request (such as a subpoena, court order, or request from a law enforcement or governmental agency) or to protect the integrity of our website or kiosks. We may report activities that we believe to be unlawful to law enforcement agencies. We may disclose Personal Information about you if we determine that disclosure is necessary for safety, national security, or other issues of public importance. We use good faith efforts to comply with the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988.

**Your Access to Your Personal Information**   
You may correct the Personal Information we have about you, change your preferences for contacts from us, or elect not to receive e-mail or other marketing materials, by contacting us as described below. You may also opt out of our electronic marketing database by following the instructions contained in all our marketing electronic communications.

**Information We Automatically Collect**   
We collect information regarding customer activities on our website to help determine how to provide useful information to you and to understand which areas of the site are of most interest to you. Our web server automatically collects information such as the domain name of the site providing you with Internet access, the Internet Protocol (IP) address used to connect your computer to the Internet, your browser type and version, operating system and platform, the average time spent on our site, pages viewed, information searched for, access times and other relevant statistics. We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements around the site, and gather aggregated information about our users.

We also collect information by using technologies and methodologies that enable tracking, such as cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website transfers to the hard drive of your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies provide visitors a personalized experience on our site by enabling us to determine unique preferences and trends based on visits to our website and to other websites. You may disable this feature in your web browser, but if you do, certain features of our website may not be available to you.

Some of our e-mail messages and web pages may include hyperlinks to web pages we or our partners operate. When you click on those links, your request passes through our web server before reaching the destination website. We track this "click-through" data to help determine interest in particular topics and measure the effectiveness of our customer communications.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**   
We are always working to improve our business methods and policies. As a result, this policy may be updated or amended. If we substantially change it, we will post a notice on this site for at least 30 days, describing the change, and we will revise the "last updated" date above to reflect the change. Changes will not alter how we handle Personal Information collected prior to the effective date of the change.
