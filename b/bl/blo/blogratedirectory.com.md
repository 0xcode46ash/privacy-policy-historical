Additional Procedures for Gathering Information

Cookies  
BlogRateDirectory.com uses "cookies" to automatically recognize returning users. A cookie is a small file on your hard drive that allows us to display your previously defined user information when you visit the Website. Usage of a cookie does not link to any personally identifiable information while on our web site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user\'s hard drive for an extended period of time. Cookies were implemented to allow user-id customization of web site information. Cookie related information is used by BlogRateDirectory.com to facilitate the user\'s transactions and to improve service and better match the user\'s needs. You may block cookies by changing the settings on your browser (contact your ISP for help), but doing so may limit the features and services contained within the Website.

Log Files  
We use log files, as well as other data in our databases, to analyze site and user behavior, troubleshoot technical problems, resolve disputes, address complaints and prepare aggregated reports that we share with others. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the web site, track users\' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

Referral & Wish List Services  
If a user elects to use our referral service for informing a friend about our site, we ask them for the friend\'s name and email address. BlogRateDirectory.com also uses email addressed entered by our users to share user wish lists with their chosen contacts. BlogRateDirectory.com collects the email address of your friend for the sole purpose of automatically sending the friend an email containing the user�s wish list information or inviting them to visit the site and does not store this information.

Advertising  
We may use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our web site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. Third party ad servers may place or recognize a cookie and, using the cookie or otherwise, collect and use data (but not your name, address, email address or telephone number) from your visits to this and other websites to serve ads to you.

Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information  
We do not disclose information relating to our business dealings with you except as authorized by you, as required by law or as otherwise reasonably necessary. We may disclose such personal information as may be reasonably necessary, including in the following circumstances:  
Those parties to whom you authorize us to give your information.  
Those parties to whom we are permitted under the applicable laws relating to financial  
matters and related services.  
Those parties to whom we are required by applicable law.

We retain records relating to the services we provide in order to comply with professional guidelines and to better serve your personal and business needs. In order to protect information relating to our representation of you, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with our professional standards. Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily disclose personal information online, that information can be collected and used by others. You should exercise caution in such disclosures.  
In addition, we may share data with any parent company, subsidiaries, JVs, other companies under a common control or acquirers. It is possible that BlogRateDirectory.com and/or any of our assets may be acquired. In such a transaction, customer information may be transferred to the acquiring entity. While we will endeavor to require the successor company to maintain this Privacy Policy, we cannot guarantee that our policy will remain in effect.

Special Relationships  
BlogRateDirectory.com may enter into special relationships with other online auction and shopping websites to widen the array of services available to our users. On occasions when we partner with another service to bring you more comparison-shopping functionality, we do not host these pages on our own servers. In these instances, information may be collected but it is being collected by the partner and not by BlogRateDirectory.com. BlogRateDirectory.com may receive information from these partners only when it is clearly stated. Unless you give explicit permission, BlogRateDirectory.com has a strict policy against sharing or selling your personal information.

Links to Other Sites  
The BlogRateDirectory.com Website contains links to other Websites. BlogRateDirectory.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these sites. If you have concerns about how other Web sites collect and use information about you, make sure to read that site\'s own privacy policy.
