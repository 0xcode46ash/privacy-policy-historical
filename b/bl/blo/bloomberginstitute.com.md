### How We Share Your Information With Others

The Bloomberg Group may share your personal and other information with our affiliates and service providers. The Bloomberg Group may also disclose information about your use of this Site, the services provided on this Site, and a masked version of your profile, including your test results for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) to BAT Users. BAT Users are: (i) users who access candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service; and (iii) other candidates. In some cases (e.g., if only a small number of individuals from a candidate’s country, university, year of graduation, and/or area of study have registered for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT)), it may be possible for a candidate to be identified from his or her masked profile. Unless the candidate otherwise indicates to the Bloomberg Group, the Bloomberg Group will share a candidate’s name, contact information, and resume, only after contacting the candidate and obtaining his or her consent, with (i) users who access the candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, and (iii) the individual at the candidate’s current or prospective employer designated by the candidate, provided that individual is a BAT User who has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting) or a BAT User who is an employee of, volunteer of, or otherwise under the direction and control of an organization that has agreed to the Agreement for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) (RECRUITING). Upon registration or subsequently when candidates inform the Bloomberg Group about updates to their profile, candidates may direct the Bloomberg Group not to share their masked profile and their name and contact information with any BAT Users. If a candidate has been invited by a current or prospective employer to take the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT), the candidate may direct the Bloomberg Group to share his or her masked profile and name and contact information with that current or prospective employer, provided that employer is a BAT User and (i) has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting); or (ii) is an employee of, volunteer of, or otherwise under the direction and control of an organization that has agreed to the Agreement for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) (RECRUITING). The candidate, upon registration or subsequently when informing the Bloomberg Group about updates to his or her profile, may also direct the Bloomberg Group not to share his or her masked profile and name and contact information with any other BAT Users.

The Bloomberg Group does not limit the identity of BAT Users to those who may access this Site or other Bloomberg Group services and products for any particular purpose. The Bloomberg Group does not control the BAT Users and cannot guarantee that their use of the profiles will comply with restrictions, if any, imposed on their use of the profiles by the Bloomberg Group.

The Bloomberg Group may also share your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy with a sponsor or other third party (“Third-Party Provider”) that provides you with special offers or promotions that may be of interest to you.

The collection, use, and/or disclosure of your information by Third-Party Providers or by other third parties including other candidates and users who access candidate profiles, is not the responsibility of the Bloomberg Group.
