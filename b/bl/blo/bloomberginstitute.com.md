### How We Share Your Information With Others

The Bloomberg Group may share your personal and other information with our affiliates and service providers. As a registrant for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) that has a profile or a registrant of a BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course that elects to create a profile, the Bloomberg Group may also disclose information about your use of this Site, the services provided on this Site, and a masked version of your profile, including, as applicable, your test results for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) or completion of the BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course to Bloomberg Institute Users. Bloomberg Institute Users are: (i) users who access registrant profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service; and (iii) other registrants. In some cases (e.g., if only a small number of individuals from a registrant’s country, university, year of graduation, and/or area of study have registered for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) or the BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course), it may be possible for a registrant to be identified from his or her masked profile. Unless the registrant that registered for the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) or the BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course otherwise indicates to the Bloomberg Group, the Bloomberg Group will share a registrant’s name, contact information, and resume, only after contacting the registrant and obtaining his or her consent, with (i) users who access the registrant profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, and (iii) the individual at the registrant’s current or prospective employer designated by the registrant, provided that individual is a Bloomberg Institute User who has agreed to the [Bloomberg Institute Terms of Service](http://about.bloomberginstitute.com/terms-of-service/). Upon registration or subsequently when registrants inform the Bloomberg Group about updates to their profile, registrants may direct the Bloomberg Group not to share their masked profile and their name and contact information with any Bloomberg Institute Users. If a registrant has been invited by a current or prospective employer to take the BLOOMBERG APTITUDE TEST (BAT) or BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course, the registrant may direct the Bloomberg Group to share his or her masked profile and name and contact information with that current or prospective employer, provided that employer is a Bloomberg Institute User and has agreed to the [Bloomberg Institute Terms of Service](http://about.bloomberginstitute.com/terms-of-service/). If a registrant has been invited by a university professor to take the BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course, information about the registrant and his or her participation in the BLOOMBERG MARKETS CONCEPTS course will be shared with that university professor, including the registrant’s name, course completion status, and any scores associated with the course.

The Bloomberg Group does not limit the identity of Bloomberg Institute Users to those who may access this Site or other Bloomberg Group services and products for any particular purpose. The Bloomberg Group does not control the Bloomberg Institute Users and cannot guarantee that their use of the profiles will comply with restrictions, if any, imposed on their use of the profiles by the Bloomberg Group.

The Bloomberg Group may also share your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy with a sponsor or other third party (“Third-Party Provider”) that provides you with special offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. You may instruct the Bloomberg Group at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by contacting [privacy@bloomberg.com](mailto:privacy@bloomberg.com "email privacy@bloomberg.com") and including Bloomberg Institute in the Subject line of your email.
