#### How We Share Your Information With Others

The Bloomberg Group may share your personal and other information with our affiliates and service providers. The Bloomberg Group may also disclose information about your use of this Site, the services provided on this Site, and the results of your BLOOMBERG ASSESSMENT (BAT) test, including a masked version of your profile that does not reveal your name or contact information to BAT Users. BAT Users are: (i) users who access candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service; and (iii) other candidates. In some cases (e.g., if only a small number of individuals from a candidateâ€™s country, university, year of graduation, and/or area of study have registered for the BLOOMBERG ASSESSMENT (BAT) test), it may be possible for a candidate to be identified from his or her masked profile. The Bloomberg Group will share a candidateâ€™s name and contact information, only after contacting the candidate and obtaining his or her consent, with (i) users who access the candidate profiles on the Site; (ii) users of other services and products offered by the Bloomberg Group, including the BLOOMBERG PROFESSIONAL® service, and (iii) the individual at the candidateâ€™s current employer designated by the candidate, provided that individual is a BAT User who has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting). Upon registration or subsequently when candidates inform the Bloomberg Group about updates to their profile, candidates may direct the Bloomberg Group not to share their masked profile and their name and contact information with any BAT Users, or may direct the Bloomberg Group to share their masked profile and their name and contact information only with an individual at their current employer, provided that individual is a BAT User who has agreed to the Terms for the BAT (Recruiting).

The Bloomberg Group does not limit the identity of BAT Users to those who may access this Site or other Bloomberg Group services and products for any particular purpose. The Bloomberg Group does not control the BAT Users and cannot guarantee that their use of the profiles will comply with restrictions, if any, imposed on their use of the profiles by the Bloomberg Group.

Consistent with the choice you make when providing personal information, the Bloomberg Group may also share your personal information covered by this Privacy Policy with a sponsor or other third party ("Third-Party Provider") that provides you with special offers or promotions that may be of interest to you. You may instruct the Bloomberg Group at any time not to share your personal information with such Third-Party Providers by contacting [privacy@bloomberg.com](mailto:privacy@bloomberg.com). Please note that it may take some time to process your request, consistent with applicable law.

The Bloomberg Group may also disclose your personal and other information to unaffiliated third parties if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or in response to a subpoena, court order, government request, or other legal process; (b) produce relevant documents or information in connection with litigation, arbitration, mediation, adjudication, government or internal investigations, or other legal or administrative proceedings; (c) protect the interests, rights, safety, or property of the Bloomberg Group or others; (d) enforce any terms of service on this Site; (e) provide you and the other users of this Site with the services or products requested by you and/or the other users (including allowing a purchaser of the Bloomberg Group or a Bloomberg Group division to continue to serve you), and to perform other activities related to such services and products, including billing and collection; and (f) operate the Bloomberg Group's systems properly.

The collection, use, and/or disclosure of your information by Third-Party Providers or by other third parties including other candidates and users who access candidate profiles, is not the responsibility of the Bloomberg Group. Rather, such collection, use, and/or disclosure is governed by the third parties' privacy policies and practices, if any.
