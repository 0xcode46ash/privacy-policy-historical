## Cookie policy

### Introduction

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, computer or mobile phone, if you agree. These small files of information are known as cookies. Cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website(s), which helps us to provide you with a better experience when browsing our website(s) and also allows us to improve our website(s). Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally.

Examples of how cookies are used to improve services for you are:

Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task

Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested

Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast  
Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just here to make the website(s) work better for you. In fact, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish.
