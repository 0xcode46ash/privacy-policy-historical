_[Last modified: August 6, 2018]_

###  **Introduction**

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) governs the data collection practices Big Star Labs LP (“ **Company** ”, “ **us** ”, “ **we** ” and “ **our** ”) uses when you use our **_Block Site_** browser add-on extension or mobile app (“ **Block Site Product** ”). This Privacy Policy is provided to make important disclosures on **how** or **why** we collect, **share** and **use** our users’ information. Our users’ privacy is important to us. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy carefully prior to using our Block Site Product and use it to make informed decisions.

By using the Block Site Product, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Block Site Product constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is part of our End User License Agreement (Link: [_https://blocksite.co/terms_](https://%20blocksite.co/terms)) and, to the extent that the processing of personal data is based on consent _(see below)_ , is a legally binding agreement between you and the Company. Definitions herein shall have the same meaning as defined therein. If you do not agree to these terms, please do not access or use the Block Site Product.

 **IF YOU OBJECT TO THESE TERMS PLEASE DO NOT ACCESS OR USE THE WEBSITE, DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, OR USE THE BLOCK SITE PRODUCT OR SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.     **

### **What Information Do We Collect?**

The information we collect includes non-identifiable information which may be made available or gathered via the user’s use of the Block Site Product and, where applicable and enabled by users of the mobile app, via the Android accessibility service (“ **Non-Personal Information** “). We are not aware of and cannot determine the identity of the user from which the Non-Personal Information is collected.

 **Non-Personal Information** collected through your use of the **browser extension** :

  * User agent;
  * Browsing history information, including URLs/domains visited, HTTP referrer, URL of service redirects and client redirects, and URL name of the link clicked on;
  * Global unique identifier (GUID);
  * TabID; and
  * Internet Protocol address: Note that while Internet Protocol address may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions, we permanently delete and hash the last portion of the Internet Protocol address before storing it, thus preventing us from having the ability to use it to transmit any information to your device.



 **Non-Personal Information** collected through your use of the **mobile app** :

  * User agent;
  * Operating system version, device model name, whether the device is rooted, screen size and mobile network code;
  * Type of browser you use on your device (e.g., Safari, Chrome);
  * All web connections from the installed apps on the device;
  * List of installed apps (including app name, app ID, installation date, update date, version, whether a system app, and whether the app is on your home page) and usage of the installed apps (including the duration of use). Note that we do not collect data from within the installed apps, but rather solely aggregated data concerning use itself;
  * Browsing history information, including URLs/domains visited, bookmarks, whether history is from sync or local, and the dates, times and durations of visits;
  * Your location (i.e., the country you are located in, but not your on-going data location);
  * Global unique identifier (GUID); and
  * Internet Protocol address and Device ID: Note that while Internet Protocol address and Device ID may be considered personal data in some jurisdictions, we permanently delete and hash the last portion of the Internet Protocol address before storing it, and we permanently encrypt the Device ID, thus preventing us from having the ability to use these items to determine your identity or to transmit any information to your device.



We may disclose or share this Non-Personal Information with third parties as specified below and solely if applicable.

We do not collect from you any individually identifiable information, namely information that identifies an individual or may with reasonable effort be used to identify an individual (“ **Personal Information** “) except as may be voluntarily provided by you if and when you contact us, such as your name and email address, provided that such information will be used solely to communicate with and support you, and will not be shared with any third parties.

###  **How is the Data Used?**

We collect your information during your access or use of the Block Site website or the Block Site   Product as detailed above. We use that information based on our legitimate interests in promoting and improving the Block Site Product and our services, on the necessity of such information for the provision of the Block Site Product and our services where applicable (as described in this Privacy Policy) or, where permitted under applicable law, on the implied consent that you provide by using the Block Site Product, or by requesting support, registering for the Block Site Product, or through your use of the various forums and blogs available within the website.

In practice, in order to provide the Block Site Product, we need to scan the webpages you browse, and we need to retrieve the apps you are trying to open. Meaning, we use the data collected from you, as detailed and specified above, and transmit it to our servers for the purpose of enabling the Block Site Product and in order to know when and where there is content, a website or an app to block.

We also use Non-Personal Information, aggregated information or statistics regarding user browsing behavior as a measure of interest in, and use of, the Block Site Product in the form of aggregated data, such as overall patterns or demographic reports, which do not describe or identify any individual user.

###  **How is the Data Shared?**

(ii) internally within the Company to conduct business and marketing analysis, and enhance your experience; or

We may share your Non-Personal Information with our parent company, any subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control (collectively “ **Affiliated Companies** “) solely if and when applicable or necessary for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.

Note that we may also appoint third-party service providers, operating under our instructions, who may need access to your information in connection with their services on our behalf. Transfers of your Personal Information will be made in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

We will take the necessary steps to ensure that international transfers of personal data (including Personal Information) meet all requirements under applicable data protection laws. When personal data collected within the European Economic Area (“ **EEA** “) is transferred outside the EEA, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that the transfer of such data provides sufficient safeguards, and you may exercise your rights, where applicable, to receive information on such transfer mechanism.
