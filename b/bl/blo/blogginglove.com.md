## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We may collect personal information so you can be identified by your name, email address or social network ID. We also collect other information that does not identify you but is meant to make your experience on the site more efficient.

## INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE

The information you submit to the site may be kept on our servers in the United States and, at some point, in other countries. This may include your name, email address, telephone number and street address. We may also save information you submit about your age, gender, favorite activities or other details.

## INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES

We may also obtain information about you from partners or other third-party websites such as MySpace or Facebook. This information will always be obtained from places that have a right to share it or sites to which you have given your permission. Examples include updated address information and additional demographic information.

## INFORMATION ABOUT OTHERS

We may also collect and share personal information about other people that you provide to us in order to carry out a task you have initiated, especially if you use cocodot to send an invitation or gift to friends and relatives. We also use your guest-contact information if you elect to share who is coming to your event or to allow comments on your event. Every use of your address book data will be triggered by you. These uses may include reminders, invitations, comments, listing responses and sending other information. We will not sell this information or disclose this information to a third party without your consent.

## INFORMATION COLLECTED AUTOMATICALLY

We use cookies and other technologies to help make the use of cocodot more efficient. When you visit cocodot, we automatically collect information from your web browser (Internet Explorer, Firefox, etc.). This information could include type of browser, IP address, access times, language, and content in previous cookie identifiers we have shared with you.

**COOKIES.** A cookie is a small amount of data that is sent to your browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. It is common practice for many websites to share cookies in order to identify you when you return, make log-in easier and remember the content you enjoy. At cocodot we may use cookies to collect information about your activity on the site, including pages you visit, designs you like, links you click, and searches you conduct. Most browsers automatically collect cookies, but you can change your browser setting to decline them. If you choose to do this, it may limit your ability to automatically sign in and to benefit from some of the functionality on the site.

**THIRD PARTIES.** Although we don’t allow advertising aimed at guests, we may have ads on the site in the form of planning guides and buying suggestions for hosts who are planning events. In this case, we may have third-party ads that utilize tracking technologies such as cookies. These cookies are used by the third parties to collect information on how you interact with their advertisements. It helps them deliver more targeted advertising and lets them know if you are interested in their offerings. We WILL NOT provide any personal information to these third parties without your explicit consent.

**TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES.** We may use standard internet technology such as pixel tags to track the use of our site or email. These are generally used to see whether a site area has been visited, or whether an email has been opened or acted upon. The information we collect in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer to our members and visitors, and to track the overall effectiveness of messaging, content, programming or other activities.

**FINANCIAL INFORMATION.** Cocodot does not store financial information. When you submit your financial information it goes directly to a credit card processing company such as PayPal, and they will store the credit card information on their secure servers if appropriate to the type of service you purchase.

## SHARING OF INFORMATION

**OTHER SITE USERS/GUESTS OF AN EVENT.** Guests who are invited to the same event as you are will be able to see your name and comments (if any). These users WILL NOT have access to your personal contact information. You can have your name removed from a cocodot guest list by contacting the host of the event or by emailing [privacy@cocodot.com](mailto:privacy@cocodot.com). Your name will be removed from that event but may be added to subsequent events at a different time or place.

**BUSINESS PARTNERS.** When you make a purchase or participate in promotions offered through cocodot, we may share your personal information to facilitate a transaction that you have initiated.

**RELATED COMPANIES.** We may also share personal data with our related companies, but all data will be covered under the same terms as this privacy policy.

**AGENTS, CONSULTANTS AND RELATED THIRD PARTIES.** Cocodot sometimes hires outside companies to perform certain services such as mailing invitations, maintaining databases and processing payments. In all instances these companies may have access to your information but will have no legal right to share this information or to use it for any other purpose than for the task you have authorized.

**LEGAL REQUIREMENTS.** Cocodot may share your personal data for several legal reasons.

1) As required by law in a criminal investigation, which will generally be a result of a subpoena or similar demand from a law enforcement agency. 2) To investigate fraud or to defend the rights, property or safety of others. 3) In connection with a substantial transaction such as the sale or merger of our company.

## CHILDREN

## HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We take appropriate physical, electronic and procedural security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. As an example, only authorized employees will have access to our databases, and they will only be able to access them for business purposes.
