|  |  PRIVACY POLICY |   
---|---  
  


Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster") is committed to protecting the privacy of our website users ("Users") and BLOCKBUSTER® members ("Members"). To that end, we offer this statement to inform our Users and Members of how we define, gather and utilize personally identifiable information. Blockbuster shall take reasonable steps to protect Members' and Users' privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the law.

Blockbuster defines personally identifiable information as information that includes any combination of the following: a person's full name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, email address and/or the genre of products rented or purchased by a person. Blockbuster can gather information about our Users in two different ways:

1\. a User supplies it in response to a request from us or   
2\. Cookie technology. 

Blockbuster collects personally identifiable information from Users when voluntarily submitted by a User, for example when a User participates in a sweepstakes or contest or registers on blockbuster.com for Online Rental services. We require that a User be 16 years of age or older to submit personally identifiable information. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We screen users who wish to provide personal information to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we do not condition the participation in online activities of a child under thirteen on providing personally identifiable information.

Blockbuster also utilizes cookie technology to process and identify order data. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a user's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. If Users choose to, they have the option to set their browser to refuse cookies. 

Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) may share and use personally identifiable information collected online to develop and improve the products, benefits and services we or selected business partners offer to our Members or Users. Blockbuster its affiliates and franchises (if permitted by Blockbuster) also may share and use certain User and Member data in the ordinary course of their business, for example, for account maintenance and debt collection. Certain information collected in connection with product purchases and Online Rental transactions may be provided to third parties for use in transaction authorization, fraud scoring and credit card fraud prevention modeling.

Secure online ordering is important to Blockbuster. Blockbuster utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card and order information. SSL encrypts all of this data, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. In addition, Blockbuster encrypts credit card information when it is stored in our databases.

Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster ) may also use email addresses or other personally identifiable information to contact Members and Users who directly communicate with Blockbuster. For example, Blockbuster may contact Users to notify them that they have won a contest or sweepstakes or to provide a requested email newsletter, order information, or operational changes. By entering your email address during registration for Online Rental services you agree to allow Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) to direct offers, information and other communications from Blockbuster to your email address. 

Except as described above, Blockbuster will not communicate with Users or Members by email or provide User or Member email addresses to business partners, unless the User or Member has provided express permission to Blockbuster. Users and Members also have the chance to opt out of other opportunities to receive promotional communications, materials and products from (1) Blockbuster, its affiliates and Blockbuster franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) or (2) their business partners. With the exception of users exercising the opt out opportunity, Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) on occasion may disclose to their business partners certain data such as names and addresses and the genre of products rented or purchased by a person, for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to Users and Members. Under no circumstances will Blockbuster disclose title-specific information to anyone except as allowed by law.
