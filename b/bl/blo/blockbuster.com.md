|  |  PRIVACY POLICY |   
---|---  
  


Blockbuster Inc. ("Blockbuster") is committed to protecting the privacy of our website users ("Users") and BLOCKBUSTER® members ("Members"). To that end, we offer this statement to inform our Users and Members of how we define, gather and utilize personally identifiable information. Blockbuster shall take reasonable steps to protect Members' and Users' privacy consistent with the guidelines set forth in this policy and the law.

Blockbuster defines personally identifiable information as information that includes any combination of the following: a person's full name, street address, telephone number, date of birth, email address and/or the genre of products rented or purchased by a person. Blockbuster can gather information about our Users in two different ways:

1\. a User supplies it in response to a request from us or   
2\. Cookie technology. 

Blockbuster collects personally identifiable information from Users when voluntarily submitted by a User, for example when a User participates in a sweepstakes or contest, purchases products online, or registers on blockbuster.com for an e-newsletter or other individualized services. We require that a User be 16 years of age or older to submit personally identifiable information. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. We screen users who wish to provide personal information to prevent users under the age of thirteen from providing such information. If we become aware that we have inadvertently received personally identifiable information from a user under the age of thirteen, we will delete such information from our records. If we change our practices in the future, we will obtain prior, verifiable parental consent before collecting any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen. Because we do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we also do not knowingly distribute such information to third parties. We do not knowingly allow children under the age of thirteen to publicly post or otherwise distribute personally identifiable contact information. Because we do not collect any personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen, we do not condition the participation in online activities of a child under thirteen on providing personally identifiable information.

Blockbuster also utilizes cookie technology to process and identify order data. A cookie is a piece of information that is transferred to a user's hard drive for record- keeping purposes. If Users choose to, they have the option to set their browser to refuse cookies.

Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) may share and use personally identifiable information collected online to develop and improve the products, benefits and services we or selected business partners offer to our Members or Users. Blockbuster its affiliates and franchises (if permitted by Blockbuster) also may share and use certain User and Member data in the ordinary course of their business, for example, for account maintenance and debt collection. Certain information collected in connection with product purchases may be provided to third parties for use in transaction authorization, fraud scoring and credit card fraud prevention modeling.

Except as described above, Blockbuster will not communicate with Users or Members by email or provide User or Member email addresses to business partners, unless the User or Member has provided express permission to Blockbuster. Users and Members also have the chance to opt out of other opportunities to receive promotional communications, materials and products from (1) Blockbuster, its affiliates and Blockbuster franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) or (2) their business partners. With the exception of users exercising the opt out opportunity, Blockbuster, its affiliates and franchisees (if permitted by Blockbuster) on occasion may disclose to their business partners certain data such as names and addresses and the genre of products rented or purchased by a person, for the exclusive use of marketing goods and services directly to Users and Members. Under no circumstances will Blockbuster disclose title-specific information to anyone except as allowed by law.

**How to Opt Out**

**1\. Direct Mail**  
If you wish to receive communications by means other than email from (1) Blockbuster, its affiliates and permitted franchisees and/or (2) their business partners, but you would like to change your election, please visit any BLOCKBUSTER store.

**2\. Email**  
Otherwise, to change your election regarding receipt of email from (1) Blockbuster, it's affiliates and franchisees if permitted by Blockbuster and/or (2) their business partners, please contact the Blockbuster Customer Service department by sending an email to customer.service@blockbuster.com.

Secure online ordering is important to Blockbuster. Blockbuster utilizes SSL (secure socket layers) to protect your credit card and order information. SSL encrypts all of this data, such as your name and credit card number, so that it cannot be read in transit. In addition, Blockbuster encrypts credit card information when it is stored in our databases.

Blockbuster supports the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 and will use reasonable commercial efforts to require employee and business partner compliance with the Act. 

REQUIRED BY NEW YORK LAW: This video tape service provider from time to time provides to marketers of goods and services, the names and addresses of customers and a description or subject matter of materials rented by video customers. You have the right to elect not to have your name, address or the description or subject matter of any material rented included in such lists. This election may be changed by you, in writing, at any time.
