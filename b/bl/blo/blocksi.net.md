### How we use information we collect

* In Blocksi Manager Analytics and Insights Admin and Teacher Dashboard
* These services are provided to a school under its [Blocksi for Education agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20170829160344id_/https%3A//blocksi.net/blocksi-edu-agreement.php) and, as applicable, [Data Processing Amendment.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170829160344id_/https%3A//blocksi.net/data-amendment.php) (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data Processing Amendment.) 
* Blocksi does not serve ads nor use personal information collected for advertising purposes.
* The Blocksi Privacy Policy describes fully how Blocksi services generally use information. To summarize, we use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Blocksi and our users. We also use this information to offer users tailored content, such as more relevant search results. We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services.
* For Blocksi Apps for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Blocksi does not use any user personal information (or any information associated with an GSuite Apps for Education Account) to target ads, while using an Apps for Education account.

Blocksi processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal information on a server located outside the country where you live.

## Information you share

When a student GSuite account is enabled for Blocksi services, Blocksi only collects analytics related to the internet browsing activity of the student and whether he has been denied access to some category of internet content or some specific sites. Teacher dashboard allows to monitor students screen during the class. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your content. 

## Accessing and updating your personal information

Whenever a student filtering is enforced by Blocksi, we aim to provide parents and guardian with access to their children web analytics and insights through the Parent Dashboard. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it – unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When a parent request to update its children information, we may ask them to verify their identity before we can act on your request.

We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup systems).

Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems.

### Transparency and choice

We provide a variety of user controls that enable Blocksi Manager For Education users (administrator and guardians) to make meaningful choices about how long information is stored in Blocksi services. Depending on the settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the Privacy Policy, such as Blocksi activity controls, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional information for parents, students, and administrators on the Blocksi Manager for Education Privacy Center.

### Parental review and deletion of information

The parents of Blocksi Manager For Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can access their child’s personal information from the Parent Dashboard and request that it be deleted through their dashboard. School administrators can provide for parental access and deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services. If a parent wishes to stop any further collection or use of the child's information, the parent can request that the administrator use the service controls available to them to limit the child’s access to features or services, or delete the child’s account entirely. Guidance for administrators on how to use service controls to accomplish this is available in the [Help Center.](https://support.google.com/a)
