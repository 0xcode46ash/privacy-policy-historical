# Privacy Policy | Bloodshot Records

## Website Visitors

Like most website operators, Bloodshot Records collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Bloodshot Records’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Bloodshot Records’s visitors use its website.

Bloodshot Records also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Bloodshot Records only discloses logged in user IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Bloodshot Records’s websites choose to interact with Bloodshot Records in ways that require Bloodshot Records to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Bloodshot Records gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Those who engage in transactions with Bloodshot Records are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Bloodshot Records collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Bloodshot Records. Bloodshot Records does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

Bloodshot Records may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Bloodshot Records may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Bloodshot Records does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Bloodshot Records discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Bloodshot Records’s behalf or to provide services available at Bloodshot Records’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Bloodshot Records’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Bloodshot Records will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Bloodshot Records discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Bloodshot Records believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Bloodshot Records, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Bloodshot Records website and have supplied your email address, Bloodshot Records may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Bloodshot Records and our products. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Bloodshot Records takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

Bloodshot Records visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Bloodshot Records’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of Bloodshot Records’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Business Transfers

If Bloodshot Records, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Bloodshot Records goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Bloodshot Records may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
