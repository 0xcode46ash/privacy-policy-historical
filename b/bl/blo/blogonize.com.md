# Blogonize - Privacy Policy

This site is owned and operated by Blogonize. Your privacy on the Internet is of the utmost importance to us. At Blogonize, we want to make your experience online satisfying and safe.   
Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we feel you should fully understand our policy and the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information. This privacy statement discloses what information we gather and how we use it. 

Blogonize gathers two types of information about users: 

* Information that users provide through optional, voluntary submissions. These are voluntary submissions to receive our electronic newsletters, to participate in our message boards or forums, to email a friend, and from participation in polls and surveys: 

* Information Blogonize gathers through aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our sites. This information allows us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and to help our advertisers and sponsors better understand the demographics of our audience. Because Blogonize derives its revenue mainly from sponsorships and advertising, providing such aggregated demographic data is essential to keeping our service free to users. Under no circumstances does Blogonize divulge any information about an individual user to a third party. 

Optional Voluntary Information...  
By voluntary submission of your email address, Blogonize will send you updates on the launch.
