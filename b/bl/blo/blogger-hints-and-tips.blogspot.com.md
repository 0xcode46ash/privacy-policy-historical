##  Introduction

All web servers, including the ones that host [Blogger-Hints-and-Tips](http://blogger-hints-and-tips.blogspot.com/), store some information about visitors, including (at least) IP address, browser and its configuration, the date and time of the visit and and details about how the visitor reached the site (from a referring page, or using what search-keywords).

This data is tracked for administration and maintenance purposes, and lets me know what articles readers are interested in. It is also used for administration and site-maintenance, and for promoting the site to potential advertisers. A key point is that it cannot personally identify visitors to this site, so is not considered as personal information.

Users who leave comments are required to be logged in, and may therefore leave personally identifying information.   The only information that is collected or stored by [Blogger-Hints-and-Tips](http://blogger-hints-and-tips.blogspot.com/) is the login account that is provided by the comment-er, and this is used only to respond to the comment(s) that are left.
