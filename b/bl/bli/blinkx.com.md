# Privacy Policy - Blinkx

blinkx recognizes that its customers, visitors, users, and others who use [www.blinkx.com](http://www.blinkx.com/) or other web sites owned or operated by blinkx (the "blinkx Sites") (collectively or individually "Users") value their privacy. This Privacy Policy details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the blinkx Sites.

This policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other websites (including those that we link to and third party websites or services that we co-brand) may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.

The blinkx Sites recognize the home server of visitors, but not their e-mail addresses. Also, blinkx tracks the Internet address of the domains from which visitors are coming and uses this data for statistical analysis, but the name of the visitor remains anonymous.

When you visit the blinkx Sites we may send one or more cookies, a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters, to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser and are used to track the usage patterns of our users on our site anonymously (i.e., in a non-personally-identifiable manner). We only track general information about each user that tells us how many searches they perform and how many videos they watch on the site. We do not record or track in any way specific information about what users search for or the videos that they watch.

blinkx uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some features of the blinkx site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.

The names and contact information of persons who request information about blinkx, its subsidiaries, its products and/or its services are added to our database, so that they may be contacted in the future regarding blinkx's products, services or future opportunities. We do not sell or rent any information about our visitors.

We use industry-standard efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information, such as firewalls and secure socket layers where appropriate. You acknowledge that acceptance of this privacy policy, as updated from time to time at this location, is a condition to your use of our website and you agree to be bound by all of its terms and conditions. If you have any questions regarding our policies please e-mail blinkx at feedback@blinkx.com.
