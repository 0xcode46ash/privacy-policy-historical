# Privacy Policy | 360Daily

### Our Commitment

RhythmOne, LLC (“ **RhythmOne** ”, “ **we** ”, “ **us** ”, or “ **our** ”) recognizes that our customers, users, visitors and others who use www.360daily.com, applications, or other websites owned or operated by RhythmOne (the “ **RhythmOne Sites** ”) (collectively or individually “ **User** ”, “ **you** ”, or “ **your** ”) value their privacy. This privacy policy (this “ **Privacy Policy** ”) details important information regarding the use and disclosure of User information collected on the RhythmOne Sites.

The Privacy Policy only addresses our activities from our servers. Other websites, including those that we link to and third-party websites or services that we co-brand, may have their own policies, which we do not control, and thus are not addressed by this policy.

### Information We Collect And How It's Used

#### IP Address

An Internet Protocol address (“ **IP address** ”) is automatically assigned to your computer every time you establish a connection to the Internet. The RhythmOne Sites recognize your IP address. Also, we track the Internet address of the domains from which you arrive to the RhythmOne Sites, and we use this data for statistical analysis.

#### Cookies

A cookie is a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters that stores data on a User’s hard drive. A cookie cannot access a User’s hard drive, and only contains as much information as the User has disclosed to a particular website. We use both “session cookies” and “persistent cookies”. A “session cookie” is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. A “persistent cookie” remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to a site. When you visit the RhythmOne Sites we may set one or more cookies on your computer that associate a unique identifier with your browser and collect non-personally identifiable information (“ **non-PII** ”) (including, without limitation, the server you are logged into, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, the sites you have visited, the products you have researched and your IP address) and in some cases personally identifiable information (“ **PII** ”) about your activity on the RhythmOne Sites. We may track general information about each User’s activity on the RhythmOne Sites such as how many searches you perform and what types of videos you prefer to watch on the RhythmOne Sites. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information we collect or you submit on the RhythmOne Sites.

We may store this information after the date of collection for various purposes, including, but not limited to: improving and iterating our technologies; understanding how you interact with the RhythmOne Sites and the services we offer; customizing and improving your experience; and monitoring User activity on the RhythmOne Sites in the aggregate. Our RhythmMax for Publishers contextual and behavioral advertising platform (“ **RMP** ”) analyzes your activity on the RhythmOne Sites to show you ads which are tailored to your interests. We may set a cookie or other telecommunications technologies to collect data about your video consumption patterns on the RhythmOne Sites. Based on this information, RhythmOne associates your browser with relevant interest categories. We use these categories to show you interest-based ads on the videos you watch on the RhythmOne Sites.

#### Opting Out

If you prefer not to receive this type of interest-based advertising, you can opt out of RMP. After you opt out, you will not receive interest-based ads. You will see the same quantity of ads as before, but they will likely not be as relevant to you. To opt out, click the link in the “RMP Opt-Out” box on this page. When you get a new computer, install a new browser or upgrade certain browsers, erase or otherwise alter your browser’s cookie file, you might end up deleting the cookies in your browser, including the opt-out cookie. If you wish to opt out again, you will need to return to this page and disable the tracking.

#### Third-Party Cookies/Opting Out/Do Not Track

We partner with third-party ad networks and allow such networks to set cookies to collect non-PII for the purpose of serving targeted ads. Such ad networks may use information about your activity on the RhythmOne Sites to show advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. RhythmOne has no control over these ad networks or their use of the information they collect. To opt out of third-party behavioral targeting, visit the Network Advertising Initiative’s consumer page at[www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). After opting out of a network, you will still receive online advertising, but the ads will no longer be tailored to your usage patterns.

Although certain RhythmOne technology may honor “do not track” (DNT) signals and similar mechanisms transmitted by web browsers or mobile device operating systems, RhythmOne is not responsible, and shall not be liable, for the acts of third parties, such as ad networks, with respect to such third parties’ tracking policies.
