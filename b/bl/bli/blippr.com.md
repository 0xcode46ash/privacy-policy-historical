# blippr.com

We really, really, really care about your privacy. Some of the basics of our policy include:

  * We don’t ask you for personal information unless we believe it will improve your experience on blippr—in which case it’s optional—or we truly need it. We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.
  * We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, further develop blippr, or protect our rights.
  * We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the ongoing operation of one of our services.
  * We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to everyone, kept private, and permanently deleted.



Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals.

## website visitors

Like most website operators, blippr collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. blippr’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how blippr visitors use its website. From time to time, blippr may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, but it will be rare. blippr also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Blippr does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

## gathering of personally-identifying information

Certain visitors to [blippr.com](https://web.archive.org/) or related applications may choose to interact with the Website in ways that require blippr to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that blippr gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up to review and contribute content at blippr.com to provide an email address. Those who engage in providing further information to blippr (e.g. entering their real name, ZIP code, gender, etc.) are able to give such information to blippr with the intention of a) displaying more information about themselves to interested parties, b) improving their ease of making transactions on other sites (e.g. clicking through to buy movie tickets with your ZIP code pre-populated). In all cases, blippr collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with blippr. blippr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## aggregated statistics

blippr may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, blippr may monitor the most popular users on blippr.com site. blippr may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, blippr does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.

## protection of certain personally-identifying information

blippr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on blippr’s behalf or to provide services available at blippr’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using blippr’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. blippr will not (see: never, ever, ever) rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, blippr discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when blippr believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of blippr, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of website and have supplied your email address, blippr may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with blippr. Of course, you can turn these off at any point when editing your profile. We primarily use [the blippr blog](http://blog.blippr.com/) to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum anyway. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. blippr takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. blippr uses cookies to help blippr identify and track visitors, their usage of blippr, and their website access preferences. blippr visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using blippr, knowing that you will not be able to sign in or use certain features of blippr at all.

## privacy policy changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, blippr may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in blippr’s sole discretion. blippr encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
