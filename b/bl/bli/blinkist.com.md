Blinkist’s subscription accesses are fee-based and advertisement-free subscriptions which enable you to access a set of our content and features through our mobile and web based applications, depending on the subscription tier you’ve purchased. We offer two subscription tiers with the following service levels:  
Blinkist Plus gives you unlimited reading access to all of our existing books and new releases and lets you make as many highlights / textmarkers as you want.  
Blinkist Premium contains all the services of Blinkist Plus, but in addition gives you unlimited access to our Audio summaries (“listening access”) and lets you use our Send-to-Kindle and Evernote-Sync features.  
The access to our library persists for the subscription period. 

To become the holder of a Blinkist account with subscription access you will have to register with your user data, submit your credit card data and confirm your subscription by clicking the button “subscribe for xx€”. You will receive a subscription confirmation email as soon as you have done this. Your subscription starts on this day. Please read our data protection notification for information regarding gathering, using and processing of your data. 

You can also subscribe via In-App-Purchase via iOS- or Android-Apps.
