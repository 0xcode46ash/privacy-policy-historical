Blizzard may from time to time change this policy in its sole discretion. You understand and agree that such changed policies are enforceable promptly after receipt of changed policies from Blizzard Internet Marketing, Inc.

**_Privacy Principles_**  
Because your privacy is important to us, Blizzard Internet Marketing conducts its business under the following principles:

_Principle 1 - Your Information is Confidential_  
All the information we compile for your website is considered confidential. Statistics about websites are protected by usernames and passwords, and we will not disclose these to unauthorized persons. To ensure this privacy, our Data Center is protected by industry standard security technology.

_Principle 2 - No Site-Specific Data is Ever Divulged Without Permission_  
Blizzard Tracker compiles statistics across all the websites it services. These statistics are limited to certain broad categories, such as Internet browser usage and screen resolution. This information is presented only in an aggregate form, and in no event will we present specific site data without permission.

_Principle 3 - Use of Cookies_  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to a computer’s hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can make a website more useful by personalizing information for visitors and by storing information about preferences on a particular site. The use of cookies is an industry standard, and many major websites use them to provide useful features for their customers.  
It is Blizzard’s policy to use cookies only for the following purposes:

  * To identify you
  * To customize our site for you

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you would prefer, you can set your browser to reject cookies. However, you will not be able to take advantage of our website if you do so. Your website’s visitors can also reject cookies.

_Principle 4 - Personal Information_  
Personal (e-mail addresses) and financial information collected is used to check the user’s qualifications for registration and to bill the user for products and services. Blizzard does not store such information linked to a cookie.  
We may use this information to:

**Blizzard’s Anti-Spam Policy**

We take a strong stand against spam. Please read this information to find out more about our Anti-Spam Policy:

_E-mail Spam_

  * We never send unsolicited e-mail. We do, however, e-mail our marketing newsletters to customers (and non-customers who request them).
  * We do not sell or give away our customer or non-customer e-mail addresses.
  * We do not allow customers to send spam. Each hosting and design customer agrees to not engage in the practice of sending unsolicited e-mail (spam) for the duration of hosting services. If we find that a customer has sent unsolicited e-mails, we reserve the right to take his or her website down.



_Search Engine Spam_

  * We do not support the process of spamming search engines. We have officially notified customers we will not use hidden keywords on any website page that we maintain, nor will we stuff image tags, metatags or text with strings of words or phrases (hidden or not), nor use keywords unrelated to the content on a given website.
  * We actively support stopping e-mail spam by offering a spam filter and by maintaining lists of known spammers.
  * We will not work with, nor link to, any industry website or company engaged in the practice of spamming.
  * We do not condone the use of link farms (automatic links from unrelated websites, created solely to boost link popularity).
