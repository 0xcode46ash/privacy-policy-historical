# Blink and Your Privacy

**Blink Privacy Policy**

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/4683)

Maintaining your privacy online is important to Blink. Please read the following policy to understand how your personal information will be protected as you use the many features of Blink. Blink maintains this Web site as a service to its members. We are committed to protecting your privacy so that your time on Blink provides you with the best and safest online experience possible.

**TRUSTe Privacy Program**

Blink is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Blink wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, we have agreed to disclose our information practices and have our privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark, Blink has agreed to notify you of: what personally identifiable information of yours is collected from you through Blink; how the information is used; any exceptional circumstance under which the information may be shared (it is the policy of Blink never to share your information); what choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; the kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse, or alteration of information under Blink's control; and how you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact [privacy@blink.com](mailto:privacy@Blink.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe at [http://www.truste.org](http://www.truste.org/). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Blink to resolve your concerns.

**Personal Information Collection**

Two kinds of personal information are requested during registration: personally identifiable information and demographic information. Personally identifiable information is required for registration, but other demographic information is optional and may be given at your discretion. During registration, Blink asks for your first and last name, an email address, and a home page, if you have one. In addition, we ask you to provide a password, and a question that can be used to identify your password if you forget it. Personally identifiable information is not shared with anyone, nor is it sold to anyone. The demographic information gathered includes gender, approximate age, state and Zip code, time zone, and occupation. You may update any of this information at any time (except your member name) from within your Blink account by clicking the Preferences menu and changing any information you wish by choosing the "General Settings," "Change Password," or "Demographics" menu options. The more information you provide us with, and the more accurate it is, the easier it is for us to customize your use of Blink, as well as provide information to you that you will find useful. For example, your personal profile might help us connect you with other members who share similar interests to yours. 

In addition to registration, we may ask you for personal information at other times, such as when you report a problem with one of our sites or services. Blink may also occasionally ask members to complete surveys that we use for internal research. Blink also tracks information about Web site visitation, on an aggregated basis. Blink calculates the total number of Blink members who have bookmarked a site. Blink calculates the aggregate number of visits to a site by all Blink members together. When you are viewing a link in a public folder, Blink also tells you the last time that link was visited by any member of Blink. You can choose not to have your links and visits counted towards these aggregate totals by checking "Add my bookmarks to the Blink search engine to help other members find great sites?" found in the "General Settings" option of the Preferences menu. This aggregate information is posted on the Web site, and available to our registered members to view. This information can also be used to help you find communities of members with similar interests.

**Personal Information Utilization**

Your personal information is used only for demographic statistics and to display appropriately targeted advertisements. For example, Blink does internal research on our members' demographics, interests, and behavior based on what you tell us when you register, what bookmarks you keep on your Blink account, and our server log files. In general, Blink automatically gathers certain usage information like the numbers and frequency of visits to Blink. This research is compiled and analyzed on an aggregated basis, meaning your personal demographic information is never directly accessed. The collective data helps us determine how often Blink members use parts of the site, primarily so that we can improve our site to keep it as interesting and appealing as possible. Blink may disclose aggregated user statistics (for example, 20% of our users are between 33-40 years old) so that we may describe our services to prospective partners, advertisers, and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. By providing this information, you acknowledge that Blink may use members' profile information to improve or customize the Blink service or to provide demographic profiling to obtain advertising. Any use of profile information will be conducted in line with the guidelines set forth in this Privacy Statement.

Blink's main goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with the best customized experience on our site. This includes communities of users, interactive communications, and many other types of services, all of which are completely free to you. For us to provide these services free of charge, we display advertisements, which cover the cost of operating this site. Our primary services are customized services -- including bookmark management, allowing access to your links from any location and any computer, as well as the ability for you to send lists of links to anyone at any time. In addition, we offer community services, such as allowing you to share any folder you want with other members or groups of members.

In addition, we can provide you with the most relevant advertisements, and therefore better service, by using the demographic information you provide and the links you choose to keep. Advertisers provide Blink with advertisements and tell us the type of audience they are hoping for, and in turn, Blink displays these ads to users matching the demographics and behaviors the advertisers are looking for. Therefore, advertisers never access any personal information. This kind of advertisement targeting is done with targeted banner ads, and targeted emails, but only if you agree to receive such email announcements. Note that Blink will not send you any unsolicited information, including email, unless you have indicated your willingness to receive such information by clicking the box on the Member Profile page. Upon registration, new members will receive a Blink welcome letter explaining the features provided by our service.

When on the site, we provide an opportunity for you to tell a friend about Blink. If you provide the email address of a friend, we send a brief note describing our services to your friend. Blink does not collect the email addresses of people whom you contact, and never sends solicitations of any kind to these addresses.

**How Does Blink Use Cookies?**

Blink uses "cookies" to identify a member's session on Blink and thereby offer continuity as the member moves around the site. Cookies allow Web sites to maintain user information across connections. They are small strings of characters used by many Web sites (including Blink) to deliver data to your computer, and in certain circumstances, return the information to the Web site. This is how we can "remember" information about members such as your password (if you choose to auto-login). Cookies contain only information that members volunteer, and they do not have the capability of infiltrating a user's hard drive and stealing personal information. The simple function of a cookie is that of helping the user navigate a Web site with as little obstruction as possible. Note that advertisers on Blink may also use their own cookies. If you set your browser to not accept cookies, then you will be unable to log on to Blink. 

**Blink Profiles**

During the Blink registration process you have the opportunity to choose whether you want your profile information to be made available to other members. This profile information includes your name, email address, and the address of your homepage, if applicable. You can change or remove your profile at any time by clicking on the "General Settings" option in the Preferences menu.

**Security**

Personal information collected by Blink is stored and maintained in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Blink does not sell or rent member information to anyone, although as discussed under the section on "Personal Information Utilization," certain demographic information is made available to other sites or advertisers on an aggregated basis. When we ask you for personal information, you are sharing that information with Blink alone, unless it is specifically stated otherwise. We do not share it with any third parties unless we believe that such action is necessary to either conform to legal requirements, protect the rights of Blink, or enforce the Blink [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms). Please be aware that Blink advertisers or Web sites that have links on our site may collect personally identifiable information about you. As stated below (Third Party Web Sites) the information practices of those Web sites are not covered by this privacy statement.

Please be aware that you might also provide personal information through discussion sessions, email exchanges or shared link folders. Certain information that you choose to post is publicly available. For example, information posted in shared folders is accessible to all members, or groups of members, that you designate. By designating a folder shared, and clicking on the add links button, you are giving consent to other members to add links to your folders. Private folders are accessible only to you. All shared link folders, chat sessions and bulletin board use is considered public and you are responsible for your actions in these areas. The Blink "Privacy Statement" cannot protect your personal information if it is transferred in this manner. We recommend that you be careful when distributing any personal information this way.

Your Blink information is password-protected so that only you have access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. We will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or in an unsolicited email. Remember to log out and close your browser window when you have finished your work to ensure that others cannot access your personal information.

**Third Party Web Sites**

Blink contains folders composed of links to third-party Web sites. These numerous linked sites are not under the control of Blink and are not affiliated with Blink, and Blink cannot be responsible for the contents of any linked site or the contents of any link contained in a linked site. Blink provides these links as a service to our members, or our members have listed their favorite sites in folders maintained by Blink. Therefore, a Web site contained in a member's link folder, or group folders, on Blink does not indicate endorsement of the linked site or its contents by Blink. Please refer to the [Terms of Service](https://web.archive.org/about/terms) for additional details.

Blink.com works with a third party that serves ads to this site. To find out more about how Flycast manages the privacy of information in conjunction with serving ads on this site, please go to <http://www.flycast.com/about_us/about-privacy.html>.
