# Blink and Your Privacy

**Blink Privacy Policy**

Effective as of June 5, 2003

Blink.com ("Blink.com") makes this Web site (the "Site") available to registered members of the Site ("Members"), subject to this privacy policy (the "Policy") and the Blink.com Terms of Service ("Member Agreement"). This Policy explains what information Blink.com collects about Members on the Site, how Blink.com uses this information, and how such information is maintained. By registering and using this Site, you signify your acceptance of this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, in whole or part, you should not use this Site, or if you are a Member, you must immediately terminate your account. 

Note that this Policy applies only with respect to the information collected by Blink.com and not any information collected or obtained through other methods or sources. 

**Personally Identifiable Information**

**Collection of PII**

Blink.com collects Member personally identifiable information ("PII") that is volunteered by Members during the registration process or in response to specific information requests explicitly presented to Members. Blink.com also collects PII that is provided by third parties to Blink.com in accordance with their respective privacy policies. Examples of PII that may be requested and/or collected include: first and last name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. In order to allow Blink.com to comply with applicable legal reporting requirements, Members who win certain prizes on the Site may be requested to provide their social security number. However, Blink.com will otherwise never share this social security information other than as required by law for tax and reporting purposes. From time to time, Blink.com may also present opportunities for Members to voluntarily provide a limited amount of general demographic information about themselves, which may include their gender, birth date, marital status, education, occupation, and household income. 

**Use and Sharing of PII**

Blink.com reserves the right to use Member PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided; (2) as disclosed at the time such information is provided; and/or (3) as disclosed in this Policy. However, please note that Blink.com may change this Policy at any time (See "Changes to this Policy," below), and that therefore Blink.com may in the future use Member PII for additional purposes not currently included in this Policy. 

When you register to become a Member of this Site, you are automatically registered to become a Member of all the other online properties in the Vendare Network (collectively, the "Network Sites"). Accordingly, Blink.com may share Member PII with the Network Sites. For a list of the Network Sites, [click here](http://www.jackpot.com/features/network.asp). 

Also, Blink.com may share Member PII (except for credit card information and social security number) with its partners, sponsors, advertisers, service providers and marketers, lookup and reference services, and any other entities that Blink.com believes are able to provide Members with special offers and opportunities. Note that although Blink.com advises everyone who receives Member PII from Blink.com to support this Policy, Blink.com has no control over such party's information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure of such party to adhere to this Policy. 

As provided in the Member Agreement, Members are required to provide their PII to Blink.com as a condition of Membership, and to understand and agree that Blink.com may share their PII with the Network Sites and unaffiliated third parties. If you do not provide the required PII or do not agree that Blink.com may share your PII with such entities, you may not register as a Member, and if you are already a Member, you must immediately terminate your account, by following the instructions in the "Terminate Account" section below. 

Additionally, Blink.com may share Member PII in aggregate, non-personal form, with select companies that wish to reach a particular Member target audience (e.g., registered female Members between the ages of 25-35, who have an average household income of over $50,000.00). This information will allow these entities to provide relevant offers to specific Members. 

Finally, Blink.com may disclose Member PII in order to: (1) comply with applicable laws; (2) respond to governmental inquiries; (3) comply with valid legal process; and (4) protect the rights or property of Blink.com, the Network Sites or other Members and users of the Site. 

**Non-Personally Identifiable Information**

Blink.com also collects certain non-personally identifiable information, including the non-personally identifiable information more fully described below. 

_Cookies._ Blink.com uses "cookies" on the Site. Cookies are small pieces of information that Blink.com's server places on an individual's computer hard drive to enable the individual to more easily communicate and interact with the Site and Blink.com e-mails. For example, Blink.com will place a cookie on a Member's computer when he/she initially registers with the Site. The next time that Member visits the Site, Blink.com's server will recognize the cookie (and the Member) and allow the Member to play the game immediately without signing in. 

While some Web browsers allow a Member to automatically reject all cookies or be notified when a cookie is about to be placed on the Member's computer, disabling this feature may compromise the efficiency and added services that cookies provide. 

_IP Address._ Blink.com collects your IP (Internet Protocol) address to help diagnose problems with Blink.com's server, and to administer this Site. An IP address is a number that is assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. Your IP address is also used to help identify you during a particular session and to gather broad demographic data. 

_Clear GIFs._ Blink.com uses a common technology known as a "Clear GIF" or "1-by-1 Pixel" on the Site and in e-mail communications with Members. A Clear GIF, or "graphic interface format" is a small graphic (in fact, truly a 1x1 pixel) that Blink.com (or a partner of Blink.com) places on the Site or in an e-mail. GIFs, which do not contain any PII, provide Blink.com with important information about how Membersuse the Site and respond to e-mail messages. With this information, Blink.com is better able to track the performance of certain promotions and understand the effectiveness of particular creative e-mail presentations. Blink.com may also allow its advertisers and promotional partners the ability to use GIFs on the Site solely to track Members who link from their respective sites to this Site, but this ability to track such activity does not allow these entities access to Member PII. 

Although the information collected through the foregoing methods does not itself contain any PII, Blink.com may analyze and match such information with other information that you provide (including PII) as well as information that Blink.com may obtain elsewhere, and Blink.com may share all or some of such information with partners, prospective partners, and other affiliated or unaffiliated third parties. 

Blink.com may also discloseany of the non-personally identifiable informationdescribed above in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, or (4) protect the rights or property of Blink.com or its Members and users of the Site. 

**Linking of Information**

Blink.com may combine information provided by a Member with information obtained from other sources. Enhancing Member files with this other information will allow Blink.com to provide Members with more relevant services email promotional offers, and direct mail pieces. For example, a Member's user profile will automatically be updated with any information that user enters on any of the Network Sites. Likewise, any information provided to Blink.com will be used to update the Member's profile on all of the Network Sites. 

**Opt-Out of Blink.com E-mails**

When you become a Member, you will automatically be registered to receive promotional offers and updates, via email from Blink.com, from the Network Sites and other associated email brands. 

Additionally, when you register to become a Member on the Site, you will be provided with the opportunity to receive promotional offers via e-mail, from partners of Blink.com. While some of these opportunities will only be sent to you if you expressly request them, others may be sent to you unless you elect not to receive them. Accordingly, when you register, please review these offers carefully. 

Members may, at any time, choose not to receive promotional e-mails from Blink.com, the Network Sites or partners of Blink.com by following the "unsubscribe" instructions in any e-mail, or (2) terminating their Blink.com account. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Blink.com may at any time contact Members for the purpose of communicating important information about Blink.com to Members. 

_Note that unsubscribing from one e-mail list does not automatically unsubscribe you from any other e-mail list that you may be on. Please read the e-mail carefully to find out which list you are unsubscribing from. If you would like to unsubscribe from all e-mail lists, you must terminate your account. In addition, if we have shared your information with one of our partners, unsubscribing from our list will not prevent these third parties from emailing you._

**Access to Information**

If you want to review, correct or change your Member account information, please go to the [Update Info](https://web.archive.org/go?page=MyAccount&args=1&arg0=general) section of the Site, and follow the appropriate instructions (you may have to log-in first). 

**Third Party Services**

Certain activities, information and services available to Members are provided by entities not affiliated with Blink.com. For example, if you choose to purchase a product or service or play a game from the site, the information you provide in connection with such purchase or game play may be made available to a third party to satisfy that purpose. Although Blink.com advises all of its partners to support this Policy, Blink.com has no control over their information handling practices and is not responsible for any failure of such partners to adhere to this Policy. 

**Third Party Cookies**

In the course of serving advertisements to this Site, third-party advertisers or ad servers may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser. The use of cookies by such third party advertisers or ad servers is not subject to this Policy, but is subject to their own respective privacy policies. 

**Links from the Site**

Blink.com provides links to many of Blink.com's advertiser and partner Web sites. If you link to any of these third party Web sites, this Policy will not apply to your use of, and activities on, those sites. We encourage you to read the legal notices posted on these sites, including their privacy policies. Blink.com shall have no responsibility or liability for your visitation to, and the data collection and use practices of, these sites. 

**Note Concerning Users Under 18 Years of Age**

Unless otherwise noted, the Site, the Blink.com e-mails and the content available in connection therewith, are neither intended for, nor directed to, persons under the age of 18. Except as otherwise noted, if Blink.com learns that a person who registers on the Site is under the age of 18, Blink.com will promptly terminate that individual's membership. 

**Security**

While Blink.com takes reasonable precautions to safeguard information transmitted between Blink.com and Members and/or users of the Site, Blink.com may be unable to prevent unauthorized access to such information by third parties or inadvertent disclosure of such information. Members and users acknowledge this risk when communicating with Blink.com. 

**Consent to Processing**

By providing PII and other information to Blink.com, Members and users of the Site fully understand and unambiguously consent to the collection and processing of such information in, and the transfer of such information to, the United States and other countries or territories, in accordance with the terms of this Policy. 

**Transfer in Certain Circumstances**

In its sole discretion, Blink.com may transfer, sell or assign information collected on or about Members and/or users of the Site, including without limitation, PII and other Member provided information, to one or more third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of Blink.com. 

**Terminate Account** Members of the Site who disagree with any provision of this Policy must immediately terminate their account with Blink.com. Accounts may be terminated by [CLICKING HERE](https://web.archive.org/go?page=MyAccount&args=1&arg0=disable&doneurl=%2Fgo%3Fpage%3DMyAccount%26args%3D1%26arg0%3Ddisable) and following the applicable instructions, or by emailing Blink.com customer service at [support@blink.com](mailto:support@blink.com). All inquiries concerning the use of Member PII by a third party must be communicated to that third party, and not to Blink.com. 

**Changes to this Policy**

Blink.com may, from time to time, amend this Policy, in whole or part, in its sole discretion. Any changes to this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised policy on the Site. Depending on the nature of the change, Blink.com may announce the change (1) on the home page of the Site, or (2) provide such notice via e-mail to Members. By continuing to use the Site following any changes or by remaining a Member, you will be deemed to have agreed to such changes.
