Business & Legal Reports, Inc., (BLR) is committed to respecting your privacy concerns with the information you entrust with us. We give users choice and consent over how their personal information is used, and remove names immediately upon request. 

**Cookies:** We use cookies to help our visitors have a friendlier, more convenient visit. Our purpose in using cookies is NOT to snoop on you. For example, we may use them to greet you by name, to store your password so you don't have to log in each time you visit, or re-enter your shipping and billing information when you re-use our shopping cart. We do NOT collect or use the information from cookies to develop a profile about our shoppers. 

**Security:** We store subscriber and password files with personal information securely. Such files are stored in secure areas not accessible to the public. 

**Removal:** We will immediately unsubscribe anyone who requests that their name be removed from our e-mail lists. To be removed, follow the unsubscribe instructions at the bottom of any e-mail from us, or send an e-mail to [service@blr.com](mailto:service@blr.com?subject=Remove%20From%20List) with the words "Remove from List" in the subject line. 

**Product alerts:** From time to time, we may also send you news bulletins or product alerts on products or services from Business & Legal Reports, Inc., or other carefully screened companies. Any such message will ALWAYS provide you with a link or other easy means of unsubscribing to further e-mails. Alternatively, you can send an e-mail to [service@blr.com](mailto:service@blr.com?subject=Remove%20Product%20Alerts) at any time with the words "Remove product alerts" in the subject field of the message.
