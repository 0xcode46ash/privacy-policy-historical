### **What information do we collect?**

We collect information from you when you register on our site or fill out a form.

In addition to standard server logs, Blur Busters uses Google Analytics for insight into web traffic patterns. Google Analytics privacy policy can be found [here](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html).

When ordering or registering on our site, as appropriate, you may be asked to enter information about yourself, including your name, email address, and other information. You may, however, visit our site anonymously.

### **What do we use your information for?**

Any of the information we collect from you may be used in one of the following ways:

To personalize your experience. Your information helps us to better respond to your individual needs.

To improve our website. We continually strive to improve the web offerings based on the information and feedback we receive from you.

To improve customer service. Your information helps us to more effectively respond to your support needs.

To process transactions, including mailing a product.

> Your information, whether public or private, will not be sold, exchanged, transferred, or given to any other company for any reason whatsoever, without your consent, other than for the express purpose of delivering the purchased product or service requested.

To administer a contest, promotion, survey or other site feature.

To send periodic emails. The email address you provide may be used to send you information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions. In addition, signing up for Blur Busters comments and forums requires registration confirmation emails. Also, the comment and forum system also sends reply notification emails. Notification settings are configurable via ‘Edit My Profile’ page (for www.blurbusters.com) and ‘User Control Panel’ (for forums.blurbusters.com).

### **How do we protect your information?**

We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you enter, submit, or access your personal information.

Blur Busters uses cookies to understand and save your preferences for future visits, keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future.

### **Do we disclose any information to outside parties?**

We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information. This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or servicing you (e.g., shipping a product to you), so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor information (e.g., How many visitors we get from each country) may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.

### **Third party links**

Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our website. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies.

Nonetheless, we seek to protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.
