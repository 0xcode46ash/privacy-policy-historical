BCBSA’s privacy policies may differ at other of its Web sites (including but not limited to the separate privacy policy for MyCommunity, whose own privacy policy controls with respect to MyCommunity’s operation in the event of any difference with this Privacy Policy) or in BCBSA’s off-line data collection and reporting practices. Information that you provide to us on the Site is not protected by the Privacy Rule under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. You should address any questions regarding the privacy policy of any of the independent, local Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield Companies (each, a “Blue Company”) directly to that Blue Company.

Such information is used to facilitate and monitor the serving of advertisements and offers for Vendors’ products or services.
