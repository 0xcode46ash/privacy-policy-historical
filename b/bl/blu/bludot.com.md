# Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting the Privacy Policy for Blu Dot Design & Manufacturing, Inc.  Your privacy is important to us and we will only use your information as permitted by this Privacy Policy.

Our Privacy Policy will let you know what information we collect, how and when we share that information and your options as for sharing your information.

**By using our Web sites or giving us personal information you agree to this Privacy Policy.**

**What information do we collect and how do we use it?**  
We may collect personally identifiable information (for example, your full name, email address, mailing address, telephone number, or credit card number) from you when you voluntarily submit the information to us when you use our website. We need this information in order to process and fulfill your order and to notify you of your order status, in order to register you as a user of this site or to provide you with services. We may also collect personally identifiable information from you if you choose to subscribe to our email program, catalog mailing list, enter the information into the shopping cart, or participate in sweepstakes, contests, and surveys, or in connection with content or suggestions you post on this site.

We also collect non-personally identifiable information (for example, interests, lifestyle choices, opinions) from you when you choose to provide or post non-personally identifiable information on this web site, or via participation in our email program, sweepstakes, contests, surveys or content or suggestions you post on this site.

Non-personally identifiable information may also be collected from you by means of Cookies and Pixel Tags. Cookies are small bits of information that this web site places on your computer. We and our 3rd party service providers use cookies and Pixel Tags to identify your IP address, browser type, domain name, and specific web pages through which you click. This data is collected automatically and utilized to help us look for trends to improve our web site and your interactive experience. The cookies that are configured by this web site do not contain any personally identifying information, such as your name, or sensitive information, such as your credit card number.

When Blu Dot conducts contests, sweepstakes, promotions and surveys, or joins with other companies to do so, if you choose to participate you may be asked to provide Personal Information. Blu Dot and the other participating companies may use this information for such purposes as notifying winners and fulfilling promotional obligations, and may also cross reference customer databases to identify common customers. Information from these activities may be used to explore future promotional opportunities or fulfill contractual obligations. Even if you have chosen not to receive communications from Blu Dot prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may still receive information from Blu Dot in connection with such activity if you register for or participate in it. You may choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information from Blu Dot or share your information with Blu Dot and the other companies sponsoring such activities.

We may share your information if required to comply with a law, regulation, court order or legal process, or if we believe it is necessary to share such information with a government entity. We may share information to protect our rights or property or if the rights of any third party are jeopardized.

**Choices for Opt-in and Opt-out**  
We and/or our third party marketing partners may contact you and market to you, including by mail, Internet connection, text, telephone, fax or mail, consistent with this Privacy Policy. However, in each of our email and texting marketing communications, we will allow you to opt out of future mail and texting marketing communications. We will attempt to require third parties with whom we share your information to also allow you to opt out of future email and texting marketing communications. Participation in certain of our programs will require you to accept email communications regarding the program itself. We will also attempt to prohibit our vendors and marketing partners from using your information in a manner inconsistent with this Privacy Policy. You may opt-out of receiving email and texting communications by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email or text message received. It may take us up to ten days to complete this process, as permitted by law.

**Our Ownership of Information**  
Our copy of all your information is an asset of ours and belongs to us. In the event of a sale, merger, corporate reorganization or similar transaction involving some or all of our business, we may share with or transfer your information to the buyer or successor entity. We may also retain a copy of that information.

**Security**  
We take every precaution to protect our customers' information. When customers submit sensitive information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration/order form asks customers to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are just "surfing."

If you have any questions about the security at our website, please contact us using the information below in the Contact Information section.

**What about privacy on other sites?**  
Our Web Site may contain links to other web sites. We provide these links for your convenience, but we do not review, control or monitor the privacy practices of web sites operated by others. We are not responsible for the performance of these sites or for your business dealings with them. Your use of other web sites is subject to the terms and conditions of those web sites, including the privacy policies of those web sites.

If you are visiting our Web site through a link from another web site or search engine, information about your visit to us may be collected by the provider of the other web site or search engine. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these other web sites or search engines.

**Privacy Policy Changes**  
We may change this Privacy Policy at any time. If we change this Privacy Policy, we will post the updated Policy on our Web site. You may wish to check this section of our Web site from time to time, because by visiting our Web Site, you agree to accept any such changes to this Privacy Policy.

**Children’s Privacy**  
The Web Sites are general audience web sites. We do not knowingly collect any Personally Identifiable Information from children younger than the age of thirteen (13) on the Web Sites and we will delete any Personally Identifiable Information later determined to be from a user younger than thirteen (13).

**California Privacy Rights**  
Pursuant to Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code, residents of California have the right to request from a business, with whom the California resident has an established business relationship, certain information with respect to the types of personal information the business shares with third parties for direct marketing purposes by such third party and the identities of the third parties with whom the business has shared such information during the immediately preceding calendar year.
