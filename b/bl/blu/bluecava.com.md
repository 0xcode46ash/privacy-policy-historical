# Device Identification for Targeted Advertising & Fraud Prevention

### BlueCava Online Privacy Policy

February 07, 2011 (this is the date of the most recent version of our policy.) We will modify the policy from time to time. Please check back here for updates.

This privacy policy covers electronic data collected by BlueCava and its subsidiaries and affiliates. We don’t have subsidiaries yet but we’re dreaming about them. Hopefully they will be some place tropical.

Before we start it’s important to note that the author of this Online Privacy Policy is not a lawyer. I did take one law school course in grad school during the 1970s from a brilliant professor who wrote our textbook on International Law. I’m proud to say I did well in this class and hopefully will do equally well explaining our stance on privacy to you in simple, understandable language. To put it inelegantly, legalese sucks.

At BlueCava we believe that the real world and the Internet world are complicated, scary places. We’d like to help make these worlds less complicated and less scary while at the same time making an honest buck. The basis of our business is identifying devices (currently computers, cell phones, television set-top boxes and gaming consoles) that are connected to certain sites on the Internet. After identifying these machines, we collect data about their behavior. We remove names, physical addresses and email addresses from the data we collect. So this means that the companies that use our services are targeting machines rather than people. That’s true, but it’s not a full explanation. You need to know more.

### How Does BlueCava Collect Information?

We collect information from the users of our BlueCava website. We also collect information from websites that use our Device Identification and Reputation services such as our customer’s sites or our partner sites. In certain cases we use Flash and HTML cookies to speed up the process of identifying the machine (caching). This allows us to identify a device faster. Here’s a slightly more in-depth view of our identification process.

BlueCava can identify a unique digital fingerprint of any Internet connected device on the planet, so long as that device is connected to a site or client that has our code or technology on it. We do this three ways. Our technology is embedded in some applications, like a multiplayer video game or a mobile application. Second, we can get the unique identity of a device when that device visits a site that contains a small amount of BlueCava code. And finally our technology can be served in an online ad. Once we gather the identity of a device then every time that device visits a site that uses our technology, we can chart its behavior and reputation.

### What Kind Of Data Do We Collect?

It’s pretty simple. We collect the identity of a device. Then, we store what that device does on sites that use our technology.. But we want you to know that we don’t collect any personal information (or PII as it’s called in the industry). We strip it out. At BlueCava, we focus on devices, not people.

When you come to the BlueCava site, we may ask you to register. We hope that lots of people do this because we use these registrations to qualify you as a potential customer. Then we’ll send you witty BlueCava newsletters, white papers, and marketing materials. We promise that we will follow the law with what we send you. Of course, the registration data that you give us when you register on our site won’t be shared with anyone except for the folks that help us with payment processing. We do want to collect payments from our customers so that we can stay in business.

BlueCava also collects basic information and statistics about who comes to our website. And as they say in the online ad biz, we do this to enhance the user experience. If we are fortunate enough to have you buy anything from us via our website, we will collect billing and payment information that we will share with our payment processor. Just so that you feel more comfortable, we don’t store your full credit card information, only the last four digits. Feel better now?

When you visit the BlueCava site or any of our customers’ sites, we identify the device visiting the site. We do this by collecting information from the browser on the device, such as the browser version, operating system, IP address, and time zone. These pieces of information are used to uniquely identify a device. Of course we do not collect any personal information, just boring stuff that most people couldn’t care less about. Using our ultra-smart backend hosted technology running on our super-fast servers, we process this information in record time, resulting in a unique Device ID for every device. Very high tech.

If you are lucky enough to be a BlueCava customer and use the BlueCava website maybe you don’t want us to contact you for marketing purposes. If that is the case, let us know by email, mail, fax or phone. The easiest way to opt-out of receiving these emails may be to contact us by email at [info@bluecava.com](mailto:info@bluecava.com). We won’t bug you if you don’t want to be targeted with what we modestly refer to as brilliance in marketing.

### Using The Data We Collect

BlueCava sells the data we collect. We sell two kinds of data. The first kind of data is the unique identity of a device. The second kind of data we sell is the behavior of that device on certain sites. BlueCava gets a fraction of a cent for each transaction we perform, but we are basing our business success on big volumes. We want to make a little bit of money a lot of times. The data we sell helps our customers fight online fraud and provides better online ad targeting; two noble causes we think. We might combine our data with the data of others to make us even better at this.

At BlueCava we are interested in machines, not people. Since the current score in the world is Machines- 10 Billion and People- 7 Billion, this seems like a smart idea. The data we collect from these machines includes sites the devices have visited, purchases made by the devices on certain sites, and possibly other information provided by our customers or partners.

We do not knowingly collect any personally identifiable information from children. If we do collect age information, and users identify themselves as under 13, we’ll block these users from providing personal information. That makes sense to us. Kids are kids and should be in that blissful state for as long as possible.

### Who Has Access to BlueCava Data?

The device identification and device reputation data that BlueCava collects is stored in the BlueCava network database and we will hang on to it for the foreseeable future. Folks that subscribe to our services have access to this data to help them better target advertising, eliminate fraud, and reduce risk. People that work for BlueCava, as well as people that provide support services for us, may also have access to the data. Of course, if required by law, we may disclose this information to government agencies, courts or law enforcement agencies. And if we are legally bound to do it, we will produce the information to comply with third party judicial proceedings, government investigations, court orders or what attorney types call legal process served on us. We also may reveal this information to protect our rights, investigate or prevent fraud, and generally defend ourselves from illegal activities, lawsuits and misappropriation of our IP. And hey, if we are approached about a merger or purchase by a huge company for a zillion dollars, we might have to reveal this information too. It’s something called due diligence. If we are fortunate enough to be purchased we may have to transfer this information to an acquirer. That makes sense.

### BlueCava Data – Opting In and Opting Out

In the world of online advertising. BlueCava allows you to pick the categories of advertising you want to see.

BlueCava allows you to opt out of sharing your advertising preferences with our customers. So if you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain but don’t want anyone to know it, we can help you opt-out so we won’t tell any of our customers that you like Jimmy Buffet.

Finally (but not in the ominous sense of the word), BlueCava allows you to opt-out of having your device tracked. What that means to us in BlueCavaland is that as we recognize the device from one website to another, we will not keep this information. For some people this is no big deal, and for others it’s really meaningful. Of course, we don’t let you opt out of us gathering information related to fighting online fraud, or the fraudsters would have a field day.

### Working With Other Sites

We can’t control what other sites do with data and privacy including those sites that use BlueCava services. We don’t want to do business with them if they are using our data improperly because that’s wrong and would reflect poorly on us.

For now, the best way to control the marketing messages you receive is to use a system developed by a trade group called the Network Advertising Initiative. You can use the NAI opt-out and still received targeted advertising from sites that do not participate in the NAI. And in some instances you can opt-out via the NAI and then you still have to go to individual sites to opt-out there too. That being said, a visit to the NAI opt out page can be useful and [here’s the link](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

Finally, for BlueCava’s opt in/opt-out as well as for NAI’s opt-in/opt-out each different device is considered independently. So if you have a lot of devices you may be busy doing the opt-in/ot-out thing.

### Consumer Access To The Information We Collect On The BlueCava Site

Consumers who come to our website have access to the information we collect about them regarding your advertising preferences.. If you want to view or change this information, contact your BlueCava sales representative or shoot us an email at privacy@bluecava.com.

We don’t provide access to the device identification or browsing information we collect except to BlueCava customers. If you are a customer you know how to access the data already.

### Keeping Your Information Secure

We prefer that data we collect is safe and accurate. Plus we really prefer that it be used correctly. As you would expect, access to customer information is restricted to authorized personnel. In other words, we take guarding our data seriously. Our servers are designed to be secure. Plus we’ve adopted a bunch of security procedures designed to prevent our data from being seen or stolen by a cabal of unauthorized bad guys. This should make you feel better. Here are some of the steps we take.

  * access to our computing facilities is controlled by high-tech electronic access keys. And it’s supplemented by a human security staff who are really big and mean looking. They have scars and may be packing.
  * we transmit our data using advanced encryption protocols. Cool, huh?
  * data access is based on the principle of least privilege. This is too complicated to explain in a bullet point.
  * access to our services is controlled two ways- password based authentication and network firewall settings.
  * application layer controls are designed to prevent other customers from getting at data that is private. So we guess you could say that at BlueCava privacy, not piracy, rules.
  * all the peeps that work at BlueCava and who have access to data are subject to our company’s policies that prohibit the unauthorized transmission of data to third parties. We don’t mess around when it comes to data.
  * No method of electronic storage or transmission is 100% secure. You see this in the movies and on TV all the time. Plus, as our lawyers point out quite emphatically and please note the capitalization for emphasis, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OR ANY DAMAGES INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES CAUSED BY THIRD PARTIES.



### Disputes, Perish The Thought

### Why Device Identification and Device Reputation Is Good for Consumers and Good For Society Too

Device identification and device reputation are important because they can help fight fraud and can help provide more targeted, more relevant advertising. By knowing the identity of a device, folks can determine if that device has been used in a not so appropriate way. Here’s an example. Let’s say a bad guy wants to commit fraud, stalk children or pretend to be someone that he/she is not. If we know the identity of this connected device (computer, cell phone, set-top box or gaming console) and this device tries to commit not so appropriate behavior again, BlueCava can recognize the device as the evil doer (not an original phrase) and can help shut off access to it. On the flip side of the ledger, if a device has done something like making a lot of legitimate online purchases then that device may get special treatment when it visits a site where it might buy something else.

Here’s the advertising portion of the business. As almost everyone knows advertising drives much of the free content we see online as well as a big part of our economy. Many people claim to hate advertising until they are looking for something to buy. Ever notice how you never pay attention to car ads until you’re in the market for a car? You get the point. So with BlueCava, we help you get ads that are relevant rather than ads that are shall we say more generic, and or irrelevant. Advertisers buy audiences and with our device data we can help accumulate audiences more efficiently. We also help advertisers eliminate waste because ads are served to devices that actually can buy something. This means advertisers can spend their money more effectively to get a better return on investment. Why serve an ad to a fraudster or a bot (a robot) when there’s no chance that it can ever buy anything? Why should advertisers pay for online clicks that are being generated by machines or by click farms in the third world? By improving the overall efficiency of the ad marketplace, we’ll see more advertisers spending more dollars on advertising programs that work better. And that’s good for everyone.

In our view, rooting out fraud and providing better online targeting makes our economy more efficient and more productive. We think that companies should get what they pay for and that consumers should not have to bear the indirect burden of fraud and waste. It’s pretty straightforward.
