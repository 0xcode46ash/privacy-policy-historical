# Privacy Policy Information - Blue Laguna's Media Archive

The following page is provided for visitors to BlueLaguna.net who may be concerned about privacy and to show our commitment to privacy. If you have any questions about this page, or need further clarification, feel free to contact the webmaster by emailing webmaster@bluelaguna.net. 

### Website

BlueLaguna.net does not collect any personal information such as your name, address, etc. However, during the course of a visit to this site, a visitor's IP address may be collected for purposes of internal tracking and statistics. We do not personally review the IP address of each individual, nor do we release this information to third parties. BlueLaguna.net often links to external sites, however, although these sites are screened for appropriateness, different privacy policies may apply. Due to our inability to control these external sites, BlueLaguna.net and its staff can accept no liability for the practices of other sites. However, if there is an issue regarding a site that we link to, feel free to contact us in order to get that linked removed. 

### L-Factor.net Forums

Most of the content of our public forums can be viewed freely without any restrictions. However, to actively participate in these forums, a valid username and email address is required. Any additional information collected during the registration process is purely optional, and entered at the user's leisure. BlueLaguna.net makes no claims to the validity of any information given by a user. Once a user registers, most of this information can be viewed by other members with the exception of their email and ip address, which is collected purely for administrative purposes and is once again never given to third parties. 

### Third Party Advertising

Most, if not all of the advertising shown to visitors to this site is being served by third party advertsing agencies. These agencies use methods such as cookies for tracking purpose on this site and any other sites within their network. Keep in mind however, this information is extremely broad, and is limited to information such as which continent you live on, opposed to which street you live on. Occasionally, I will ask for demographic information such as age or gender that will be given to one or more of these agencies, but proper notification will be given before any such information is collected. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click here 

### Third Party Cookies
