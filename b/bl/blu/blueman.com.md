# Blue Man Group :: Privacy Policy

Blue Man Group understands and respects the importance of individual privacy. We are committed to protecting your privacy and safeguarding your personal information. The following document outlines our policy on collecting personal information from our website visitors at www.blueman.com and how we utilize that data.

**Children:**  
Blue Man Group has no intention of collecting any personal data from individuals twelve years old and younger. Where appropriate, Blue Man Group will specifically instruct children not to submit such information on our websites and/or will take reasonable steps to ensure parental consent to such submission. If we know that a child under 13 has sent us personal information, we will automatically delete the information from our system. If you would like to grant your child permission to receive e-mail updates or to allow him or her to use our chat rooms or message board, please fill out our permission slip.

Parents should be aware that Blue Man Group's Privacy Policy will govern our use of personal data, but that information which is voluntarily given by anyone (including children) in chat sessions, email exchanges, bulletin boards or the like may be used by other parties to generate unsolicited mail.

**The Information We Collect:**  
Blue Man Group will not collect any personally identifiable information about you (e.g., your name, address, telephone number or email address) through our websites unless you have provided it to us voluntarily. For example, you may be asked to provide personal information so that you can register for a sweepstakes or contest, subscribe to our mailing list, participate in a game or promotion, receive information, order tickets or products, fill out a survey, or join a club. Your participation is voluntary and we will not require you to provide more information than is necessary to participate in any of our website's activities. If you do not want your personal data collected, please do not submit it to us. Please note, our merchandise order forms also require financial information such as credit card numbers.

**Additional Information Collected Automatically:**  
In some cases, we may automatically collect technical information when you connect to our site that is not personally identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet Browser you are using, the type of computer operating system you are using and the domain name of the website from which you linked to our site.

**Chat Rooms and Message Boards:**  
The Blue Man Group website provides chat rooms and message boards for our users. Please note, any information you post in these areas becomes public knowledge. Please exercise caution and discretion when disclosing any personal information through one of these forums. Information you post voluntarily as part of a message board or chat room is not considered confidential. Your contributions may be posted by Blue Man Group, and you will not be able to remove or edit your postings. All submissions become the property of Blue Man Group.

**How We Use The Information We Collect:**  
We may use the information you supply us to fulfill a merchandise request or to execute a contest. We may also use the personal information you supply us with in the following ways, unless stated otherwise: we may store and process information to better understand your needs and how we can improve our services and or products; we may use that information to contact you; and/or we may provide other third parties with individual information about visitors to or users of our sites. We do not now and do not intend to sell personal data about you to third parties.

You can subscribe to our website mailing list if you would like to receive information and updates on our activities, shows and merchandise. You may choose at any time to cancel your "subscription" and terminate this type of correspondence from us by checking the relevant box on the registration form.

Access by our employees and agents to your personal information is only on a need to know basis on the understanding that this is confidential business information.

**Security Precautions:**  
Blue Man Group uses state of the art software to protect the information we receive through our website. All financial information we receive, such as credit card numbers, are encrypted and cannot be read as it moves through the Internet. We use Network Associates Pretty Good Privacy, PGP, to encrypt the information you send us through our Checkout, so that it cannot be read in transit. When you enter our Checkout page you are in a secure area of our server. This can be noted by the closed lock in the bottom left of your browser window. Whether you pay by credit card, check, or money order, all of your account and order information (including your credit card information, mailing addresses, email address and telephone number) will be encrypted to ensure your privacy. While no data can be guaranteed 100% secured, Blue Man Group takes the security of your personal information seriously. We continually strive to protect your information, but Blue Man Group cannot warrant the security of any information you transmit to us and you do so at your own risk.

Please be aware that anytime you voluntarily post information in a chat room or on a message board, a third party may collect this information and use it for their own purposes.

In certain situations, Blue Man Group may be required by law to disclose information to the authorities. We may also turn over information to law enforcement or government officials if we determine that the disclosure of such information is necessary and appropriate.

The gallery feature of our Create Your Own Artwork game is currently available to any visitor of the site and as such may be used in ways that do not comply with our privacy policy or the standards set forth on blueman.com. Blue Man Productions has the right to remove any gallery posting. We monitor the gallery periodically to remove any material we deem offensive and will take action to evaluate any submission brought to our attention via management@blueman.com.

**Changes in Our Policy:**  
We reserve the right to change this Privacy Policy at our discretion. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy we will post those changes here.
