**BLUEPAGES.com Statement of Privacy**

The Internet is an amazing tool. It has the power to change the way we live, and we're starting to see that potential today. With only a few mouse-clicks, you can follow the news, look up facts, buy goods and services and communicate with others from around the world - even people you might never have met. It's important to the BLUEPAGES to help its customers retain their privacy when they take advantage of all the Internet has to offer. The BLUEPAGES is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful, safe, online experience that you can get anywhere. 

The BLUEPAGES has a mission to unite the body of Christ world wide and build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting Christian principles in the secular business market and of fair information practices.
