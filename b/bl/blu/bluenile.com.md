| 

  
The Blue Nile privacy policy is your guarantee that any personal information you provide us will remain private. We ask for personal information so that we can provide you with a personal and customized shopping experience. Your personal information will never be sold to any third party for any reason. Blue Nile is committed to keeping your personal information private. Please review our privacy policy for more detail. 

  
This statement confirms that Blue Nile, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. TRUSTe is an independent, nonprofit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the use of fair information practices. Because Blue Nile wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, Blue Nile has agreed to disclose its information practices on the Blue Nile Web site and have its privacy practices reviewed for compliance by TRUSTe. By displaying the TRUSTe trustmark on this Web site, Blue Nile has agreed to notify you of:   


  * What identifiable personal information regarding you or a third party is collected from you on this Web site; 
  * The organization collecting the information; 
  * How the information is used; 
  * With whom the information may be shared; 
  * What choices are available to you regarding collection, use, and distribution of the information; 
  * The security procedures that are in place to protect against the loss, misuse, or alteration of information that is under the control of Blue Nile, Inc.; and,

[](https://www.truste.org/validate/4826) If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact the Blue Nile customer service department at [service@bluenile.com](mailto:service@bluenile.com) or at 800-242-2728. If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or if your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/). TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with Blue Nile to resolve your concerns. 

  
At Blue Nile, we are committed to protecting your privacy. We promise to keep all the information that you share with us confidential. We only collect personal information from customers in order to process billing, fulfill orders, and provide a personal and customized shopping experience. We do not share your information with any outside parties.    
When placing an order, you provide your name, mailing address, telephone number, e-mail address, credit card number, and expiration date. For customers paying through alternative methods (such as a bank wire), additional information is required. We collect that information in order to: 

  * Verify your identity for payment authorization; 
  * Ship your order to you; 
  * Contact you regarding your order status; 
  * Personalize your shopping experience; 
  * Send you helpful information from Blue Nile; and, 
  * Generate anonymous statistics. 



Your personal information will be shared with your credit card company and the party through whom your product is shipped. This shared personal information includes all the following: 

  * your name; 
  * your e-mail address; 
  * your street address; 
  * your telephone number; and, 
  * your credit card information (so we can authorize and charge the purchase). 

Through the Blue Nile shopping cart, you may elect to use the AOL QuickCheckOut or Microsoft Passport Wallet functions. If you elect to use either of these wallet technologies to complete your online purchase with Blue Nile, the information listed above as well as your transactional information will be passed along to that respective party and will then be governed by that party's privacy policy. Blue Nile is in no way responsible for the data collected or the privacy practices of either AOL or Microsoft. If you previously signed up for the AOL QuickCheckOut and/or Microsoft Passport Wallet tools, you have already consented to the passage of such information so you will not be asked for permission again before your information is passed along. Please consult your agreements with those parties if you have questions about their treatment of your personal information. 

Your personal information will not be sold to mailing-list firms or distributed to any of Blue Nile's partners without your permission. Although we may occasionally share statistics about our customers with important business partners, we do not disclose any identifying information about individual customers. If you elect to participate in a Blue Nile promotion (contest or sweepstakes), we will share your personal information with those organizations in order to ensure redemption of that promotion with the third-party partner managing that promotion. Further, Blue Nile provides you with access to third party partners to provide you certain services. If you decide to utilize these types of third party services, you will be directed to that third party's application. Blue Nile will provide that third party with your transaction information and then that third party will collect the additional information it needs in order to provide you with the requested service. Any information that you provide directly to that third party in connection with such services is covered by the privacy practices of such third party. Blue Nile is in no way responsible for the data collected or the privacy practices of any third party. You may want to consult the privacy policies of a third party prior to providing that third party with your address or other identifying information. 

  
If the personal information we've gathered from you changes or you no longer desire our service, we will gladly correct, update, or remove any personal data you have previously provided to us. To request a change or removal of your personal information, send e-mail to [service@bluenile.com](mailto:service@bluenile.com) or contact one of our customer service associates at 800-242-2728.
