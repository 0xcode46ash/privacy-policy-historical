# Privacy Policy | Blue Nile

DATA PROTECTION FOR INDIVIDUALS BASED IN THE EUROPEAN ECONOMIC AREA AND SWITZERLAND

For the purposes of personal information that we might receive in the US from the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or Switzerland, we have elected to self-certify to the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-US Privacy Shield Framework administered by the United States Department of Commerce (“Privacy Shield”). As part of the self-certification process, we commit to comply with the Privacy Shield Principles of Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfer, Security, Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation, Access, and Recourse, Enforcement, and Liability, and a set of supplemental principles (“the Privacy Shield Principles") and to subject all personal information received from the EEA and Switzerland in reliance on Privacy Shield to the Privacy Shield Principles. Our Privacy Shield certification applies equally to the following affiliated entities based in the United States: Blue Nile Worldwide, Inc. and Blue Nile, LLC..

For the purposes of enforcing compliance with Privacy Shield, we are subject to the investigatory and enforcement authority of the United States Federal Trade Commission. For more information about Privacy Shield, please visit the United States Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield website, located at: [https://www.privacyshield.gov](https://web.archive.org/outbound.jsp?goto=https://www.privacyshield.gov). To review the details of our self-certification, see the United States Department of Commerce's Privacy Shield self-certification register, located at: [https://www.privacyshield.gov/list](https://web.archive.org/outbound.jsp?goto=https://www.privacyshield.gov/list). If there is any conflict between the provisions of this Privacy Policy and the Privacy Shield framework itself, the provisions of Privacy Shield shall prevail.

The sections entitled "Collection of Information” and “Use of Your Personal Information” above describe the types of personal information we collect in reliance on the Privacy Shield, the purposes of the data collection and use, the types of third parties to which we disclose the personal information and the purposes of the disclosures, to the extent these sections concern personal information transferred from the EEA or Switzerland to the U.S. If we intend to use your personal information for a purpose that is materially different from the purposes for which it was originally authorized under this Privacy Policy or subsequently authorized, or if we intend to disclose it to a third party acting as a controller not previously identified to you, we will offer you the opportunity to opt-out of such uses and/or disclosures where it involves non-sensitive information. Where sensitive information is involved in the above situations, we will seek to obtain opt-in consent from you unless we can rely on another legal ground as provided in the Privacy Shield Principles.

If we disclose personal information to a third party acting as a data controller or as an agent, we will comply with, and protect the personal information as provided in, the Accountability for Onward Transfer Principle under the Privacy Shield. We are responsible and liable under the Privacy Shield if third-party agents that we engage to process the personal data on our behalf do so in a manner inconsistent with the Privacy Shield, unless we prove that we are not responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.

You are entitled to ascertain if we process any personal information relating to you and, if so, to access any such data and/or to request that we correct, amend, or delete it if it is inaccurate or processed in violation of the Privacy Shield Principles, except where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy in the case in question, or where it would violate the rights of someone other than the individual requesting access. If you would like to ascertain if we process any personal information relating to you or to request access to, correction, amendment, or deletion of your personal information, you can submit a written request to the contact information provided below. We may request specific information from you to confirm your identity and, in some circumstances, we may charge a reasonable fee for access to your information.

We will respond to any queries or complaints regarding the use or disclosure of your personal information within 45 days of receiving your query or complaint.

For any unresolved complaints under our Privacy Shield, we have registered with JAMS, which will act as a US-based trusted third party dispute resolution provider. You may contact JAMS, at no cost, at [https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim](https://web.archive.org/outbound.jsp?goto=https://www.jamsadr.com/file-an-eu-us-privacy-shield-or-safe-harbor-claim). In certain circumstances, you may be entitled to pursue binding arbitration for the resolution of your complaint. For more information on binding arbitration, see US Department of Commerce’s Privacy Shield Framework: [Annex I](https://web.archive.org/outbound.jsp?goto=https://www.privacyshield.gov/article?id=ANNEX-I-introduction) (Arbitral Model).
