# NEW YORK RANGERS PRIVACY POLICY - New York Rangers - Team

Thank you for visiting NYRANGERS.COM.  Your patronage means a lot to us.  At Madison Square Garden, L.P. ("MSG"), we understand that privacy is an important issue for visitors to our websites and are committed to safeguarding your privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) describes the personally identifiable information we gather about you on NYRANGERS.COM, what we do with it and the safeguards we have in place to protect it.

Before you submit any information to NYRANGERS.COM, please read this Policy for an explanation of how we will treat your personal information. By using any part of NYRANGERS.COM and submitting your personal data, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as further outlined below in this Policy.  If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not provide personal identifiable data to NYRANGERS.COM. Your use of any part of NYRANGERS.COM indicates your acceptance of this Policy and of the collection and use of your personal information in accordance with this Policy.  Please note that this Policy applies only to personally identifiable information collected on NYRANGERS.COM.  It does not apply to any other information collected or obtained by any other means by members of the “MSG Family”.   For purposes of this Policy, the term “MSG Family” includes, as modified and without limitation, Madison Square Garden Networks,  New York Knicks, New York Liberty, Radio City Entertainment, Madison Square Garden, L.P., Cablevision Systems Corporation, News 12 and each of their respective parent companies and affiliated entities.

You should note that NYRANGERS.COM has business relationships with (and may provide hyperlinks to) unaffiliated third parties that are not part of the MSG Family (e.g. sites that offer discounts for certain products, sells tickets, sells MSG merchandise, or advertises ticket promotions or provides fantasy games, subscription services, registration for camps and clinics, etc.) (“Partners”) and may share this information with such business partners in order that they may offer you special promotions.  If you visit a third party site by clicking on such hyperlink found on our webpage, you will be subject to that third party site’s privacy policy; and we encourage you to review that website's privacy policy before providing any personally identifiable information.  The entities controlling these third party websites are responsible for ensuring compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules. 

If we make any material changes to this policy, those changes will be posted here so that you are always aware of what information is collected, how it is used and when, if ever, it is disclosed.  Since the Policy is subject to change from time to time, we encourage you to review it periodically, especially prior to providing any additional personal identifiable information. At any time, you can opt-out of the collection and/or use of this personal identifiable data by  any member of the MSG Family or Partners sending us this instruction in an email tofeedback.msg@thegarden.com.   If you continue to use the NYRANGERS.COM website, your use will signify acceptance of the terms of the new policy.

Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions, concerns, requests or comments by email at [feedback.msg@thegarden.com](mailto:feedback.msg@thegarden.com) or write us at NYRANGERS.COM, Madison Square Garden, L.P., Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, New York, 10121.

**Parental and/or Legal Guardian Consent Is Required Before Personal Information Is Collected From Children Under the Age of 13  
**MSG cares about protecting the personal identifiable information of children and does not knowingly collect nor use personal identifiable information voluntarily supplied without verifiable parental consent of a child (e.g. by requiring parents to fax a signed consent form, or sending emails that can only be opened with a PIN number supplied upon extending parental consent). A parent may revoke previously extended approval at any time. By giving parental and/or legal guardian consent, the parent/legal guardian agrees that his/her child’s personal identifiable information may be shared with the MSG Family and Partners for purposes of offering discounts, promoting services and products, providing news on upcoming events, providing programming schedules, conducting surveys, providing special gift offerings, offering ticket discounts, and conducting games and sweepstakes. If a parent/legal guardian decides not to authorize the online collection and/or use of personal identifiable information as described in this privacy policy, the child will still be able to participate in such offerings, discounts, games and sweepstakes.  

Types of Personal Identifiable Information  
The types of personal identifiable information collected are (i) names; (ii) email addresses; (iii) ages; (iv) mailing addresses; (v) hobbies; (vi) sports and entertainment interests; (vii) telephone numbers; (viii) fax numbers; and (ix) viewpoints on current events.  This personal identifiable information is only collected when voluntarily supplied by visitors to the site.

Where is Personal Identifiable Information Collected  
Personal identifiable information is collected on the website through our newsletters, fan sites and other web pages, including, without limitation, "Email Us," "Liberty Enews," "NYK Mail," "Blue Shirt Extra," "Radio City Entertainment Backstage Access," "Request for information," "Request an Appointment" forms, as well as through voluntary online surveys, promotional offerings and sweepstakes.

**Use of Personal Identifiable Information  
**A visitor to the NYRANGERS.COM website agrees that personal identifiable information that he/she provides may be used by the MSG Family and Partners for purposes of offering discounts, promoting services and products, providing new services and products, providing news on upcoming sporting and entertainment events, providing programming schedules, conducting surveys, providing special gift offerings, offering ticket discounts, conducting games and sweepstakes, and other similar purposes.  Your information also may be provided to an entity that acquires all or any part of MSG’s assets or in a merger or acquisition, in which case MSG will require the recipient of this information to comply with this privacy policy. Further, we may disclose personal identifiable information to law enforcement or other government officials, but only if required to by subpoena, court order or other legal process. 

Use of Aggregated Data  
The MSG Family routinely gathers anonymous data on Web site activity, such as how many people visit the site, what pages they visit, where they come from, how long they stay, what items they purchase, etc.  Data is collected on an aggregate, anonymous basis, which means no personal identifiable information is disclosed to members of the MSG Family or its Partners.  Data is gathered through the use of Internet server logs and cookies.  A web server log is a file where website activity is stored. A cookie is a small piece of information that a website sends to a visitor's computer, which is stored on his or her hard drive.  MSG uses cookies to track repeat visits to its website.   Although MSG assigns a cookie to a visitor's computer, it does not know who that visitor is unless that person specifically tells us.  Please know that you have the ability to disable cookies from being used to track visits to NYRANGERS.COM website.

Consent to Transfer  
This site is operated in the United States.  If you are a resident of the European Union or other location outside the United States, please be advised that any information you provide will be transferred to the United States.  By using this website, you consent  to this transfer and to the use of the personal identifiable data as described herein. 

Opting-Out of Use of Personal Identifiable Information  
If you have provided personal identifiable information to NYRANGERS.COM and later decide that you rather not have the MSG Family use such data in accordance with Policy as provided herein, you can opt-out of this use at any time by: (i) going to the link provided at the bottom of any email you receive from a MSG Family member and opting out of receiving information from any MSG Family member, or (ii) by sending us an email at feedback.msg@thegarden.com, or (iii) writing us at NYRANGERS.COM, Madison Square Garden, L.P., Two Pennsylvania Plaza, New York, New York, 10012.

Will MSG Sell Your Personal Identifiable Information To Outside Parties?  
MSG does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to outside parties.  Also, MSG may provide aggregate statistics about our customer's sales, traffic patterns, and related site information to reputable third-party vendors, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

  * Users are required to login using a unique user ID and password.
  * A firewall (a combination of computer hardware and software) keeps unauthorized users from accessing information within MSG's computer network.
  * Encryption technology is used to secure customer data when it's being transferred from one computer to another.
