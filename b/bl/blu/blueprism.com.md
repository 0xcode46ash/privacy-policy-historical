# Privacy Policy - Blue Prism

**Blue Prism Privacy Policy – updated December 2018**

Blue Prism takes its data privacy responsibilities seriously. This privacy policy explains what personal information Blue Prism collects on customers, partners, vendors and marketing contacts, and how we use it.

If you have any queries regarding this privacy policy or our use of your information, please contact [privacy@blueprism.com](mailto:privacy@blueprism.com).

 **What personal information does Blue Prism have?**

We may collect and process your name, email address, job information, phone number, address and cookie information. Personal information can be collected through sales enquiries, marketing events and downloads, use of the Blue Prism websites and the Blue Prism portal and from third parties.

Blue Prism Limited (registered in England & Wales under company number 04260035) is the data controller of your personal information, although it may have been initially collected by a subsidiary of Blue Prism Limited based in another country or by a partner organisation.

 **How is my personal information used?**

If you are a customer or a partner your personal information will be used for contract management, sales administration, Blue Prism portal access and product updates. We will also use your personal information to respond to your product support requests. This will allow us to fulfil our contractual obligations owed to you and to support our business relationship with you. 

If you are a Blue Prism Digital Exchange user your personal information will be used to provide you with the Digital Exchange asset(s) you have accessed and relevant updates and information. We may also pass on your personal information to the asset provider for the same purpose. 

We may also use your personal information for marketing purposes if we have your consent or a legitimate interest in doing so. We may, from time to time, contact you to keep you informed about our products and services, special offers, events or our partners’ products and services. You can unsubscribe from marketing emails at any time. We may also pass your personal information to the Digital Exchange asset providers for the assets that you have accessed for marketing purposes if you have given your express consent.

If you provide us with your personal information using one of our website forms we will hold this information to track if you visit the Blue Prism website again, and to follow up with you if you request Blue Prism to do so. We may also collect information about the use of the Blue Prism website such as the types of information accessed and how many users we receive daily. Blue Prism may use this data for statistical analysis, marketing, or similar promotional purposes. Please see the Cookies policy for more details.

 **Is my personal information shared with third parties?**

We may share your personal information with other Blue Prism companies. Details of Blue Prism companies can be found on our website homepage. Where another Blue Prism company processes your information the same principles of this policy will apply. We may also share your personal information with our suppliers to process your personal information on our behalf and with Digital Exchange asset providers as described above. If you would like further information on our suppliers and their privacy policies, please contact us at privacy@blueprism.com

If Blue Prism needs to transfer your personal data to a third party outside of the European Economic Area we will ensure that your personal information is appropriately protected through US Privacy Shield, standard contractual clauses approved by the EU Commission or other means approved by our supervisory authority.

 **Can I find out what information you have about me?**

You have the right to request a copy of the personal information Blue Prism holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. You also have the right to have your personal information removed from our marketing database if you no longer wish to receive marketing communications. Please send your requests to [privacy@blueprism.com](mailto:privacy@blueprism.com).

 **How long will you keep my personal information?**

For customers, partners, portal users and vendors, we will keep your personal information for up to six years after your contract with us ends. For marketing contacts, we will keep your personal information for up to one year after the last marketing communication we send to you unless you request for Blue Prism to delete it sooner.

 **How do I complain about use of my personal information?**

If you would like to make a complaint about our use of your personal data please send details of your complaint, including the personal information it relates to, to [privacy@blueprism.com](mailto:privacy@blueprism.com).
