**General**

BlueTie, Inc. is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. BlueTie respects the privacy of every individual who visits www.bluetie.com (the "Web Site" or “Site”). Your privacy is very important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines the information we will collect and how we will use and share that information. This Policy will also tell you what to do if you do not want your personal information collected or shared. If you have any questions about our policy, please email us at [privacy@bluetie.com](mailto:privacy@bluetie.com).

**Your Acceptance Of These Terms**

By using the Web Site, you signify your assent to our [Privacy Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20020604011720id_/http%3A//www.bluetie.com/about/privacy.asp?id=&res=). If you do not agree to this Policy, please do not use the Site. Your continued use of the Web Site following the posting of changes to its terms means you accept those changes.

**Personally-Identifiable Information**

There are cases where we may ask you for personally-identifiable information such as your name, mailing address, email address and telephone number. We request personally-identifiable information when you register as a member of the Web Site, for online transactions, feedback forms, surveys and for other services that require registration or subscription. We will not collect any personally-identifiable information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. Please note that although certain registrations within BlueTie require certain user information, registration itself is entirely optional. We will also collect other users' comments about you in our feedback area.

When you provide us with personally-identifiable information, BlueTie may:  


  * store and process that information to better understand your needs, customize your experience, and to improve our products and services;
  * use that information to contact you periodically via email and postal mail for informational, marketing and promotional purposes (i.e. site updates, blueCards, etc.);
  * disclose that information to third parties who need such information to provide products and services that you have requested;
  * disclose that information to third parties when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be causing injury to or interference with (either intentionally or unintentionally) BlueTie's rights or property, other members or users of the Web Site, or anyone else who could be harmed by such activities; and
  * disclose that information to third parties when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.



Except as stated in this Privacy Policy, or as otherwise stated at the time personally-identifiable information is gathered, we will not provide personally-identifiable information to third parties.

**Financial Information**

BlueTie may ask you for your credit card number and expiration date when you register as a member of the Web Site or order goods or services from the Web Site. We may use this information for processing your registration and order and may share this information with credit card processing companies, the merchants from whom you have ordered, and any other third party that may need the information to process your order. These organizations have their own privacy and data collection practices, and we have no responsibility for these independent policies.

**Non-Personally-Identifiable Information**

BlueTie may also collect information about you that is not personally-identifiable. This type of information includes your age, gender, zip code, area code, interests and preferences. We will not collect any such information about you unless you provide it to us voluntarily. We may share this information in the aggregate with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. For example, we may inform a sponsor that the membership of the Web Site is x percent females and y percent males. These data are used to customize our Site's content and advertising. We will also use that and other data and information to make visits to the Site easier, quicker, and better for you and our other members and users. We also may track certain information about your visit to the Web Site, including (without limitation) pages viewed, clickstreams, and searches. Such information is gathered in the aggregate and is not identified by any specific users.

**Other Special Circumstances**

Contests, sweepstakes, or other promotions on the Site will have separate privacy practices with regard to the information collected in connection with entering or participating in any such event. You will have a choice of whether or not you would like to allow certain information shared with third parties who may have a product or service of interest to you. You will also have the choice of whether a company that is co-sponsoring a promotion or contest may contact or send information to you.

**Modification of Information and Opt-Out**

If you indicated on registration that you are interested in receiving offers or information from BlueTie and our partners, we may occasionally send you e-mail about products and services we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not want to receive such mailings, simply write us at the Opt Out address below. Or, if you have been receiving the mailings and if you would like to remove or change that option or some other information you have submitted, you may do so by sending us a letter at the Opt Out address below. (Remember, however, that removing some or all of your information may limit your ability to access some or all of the features and services of the Web Site.)".

In addition, to keep you in control of your personally-identifiable information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt-out of receiving marketing and promotional communications from BlueTie. You may opt-out of this service by following the instructions included in the communications or by writing to BlueTie, Inc. at: 

> > Opt Out  
>  BlueTie, Inc.  
>  29 Goodway Drive  
>  Rochester, NY 14623  
> 

**Service Announcements**

On rare occasions it is necessary to send out a strictly service related announcement. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance we might send users an email. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications, though they can deactivate their account. However, these communications are not promotional in nature.

**Information Collected Automatically**

BlueTie may also automatically collect non-personally-identifiable information about your use of the Web Site, such as the domain from which you access the Internet (for example, aol.com, if you are connecting from an America Online account), the date and time you access the Site, and the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Site. This information will not be linked to personally-identifiable information. We may use this information to analyze and enhance our Web Site and for security purposes, and we may aggregate this information and share the aggregated information with business partners, sponsors, and other third parties.

**Information Placed Automatically On your Computer's Hard Drive**

Not all cookies are edible. A “cookie” is information stored on your computer when you view a website. Our cookies help us in many ways. For example, cookies allow us to track your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. Cookies also allow us to tailor the Web Site to better match your interests and preferences. If you visit another website from our Site, you may also receive a cookie or similar file from that site. With most Internet browsers, you can erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. Remember, however, that blocking or deleting cookies may limit your ability to access some or all of the features and services of the Web Site.

**Uploaded Information**

We will not disclose to third parties any information, data and other materials that you upload to any non-public areas of the service offered on the Web Site (e.g., your calendar, your file folders, etc.) except as directed by you or when we believe in good faith that the law requires it.

**Changing or Deleting Your Personal Information**

BlueTie allows you to modify or delete your personal information or preferences, by clicking on the "Edit My Info" link in the top right corner of the navigation. You may also call BlueTie at 1-800-BLUE-TIE to request account cancellations or information changes.

**Children**

The Web Site is not directed at individuals under thirteen years of age, and BlueTie does not intend to collect any personally-identifiable information from such individuals.

**Links to Other Web Sites**

The Web Site allows links to various other web sites. We assume no responsibility for the information practices of sites you are able to access through the Web Site. Furthermore, a link to another does not imply an affiliation or an endorsement of that linked site.

**Security**

Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online --- for example, via instant messaging or online meetings--- that information can be collected and used by people you don't know. While BlueTie strives to protect your information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

The importance of security for all personally-identifiable information associated with our users and members is of utmost concern to us. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your personally-identifiable information, we can't ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. However, once we receive your personally-identifiable information, we will take reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

In certain areas BlueTie uses SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions.

Your account on the Web Site is password protected so that only you can access it and view the member information relevant to the account. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. BlueTie will never ask you for your password in an unsolicited phone call or email. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and any account information. Remember to sign out of your account on the Web Site and close your browser window when you have finished your work. This will ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence if your computer is accessible to others, if you share a computer with someone else, or if you use a computer in a public place like a library or Internet café.

**Privacy Policy Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy for BlueTie, we will post those changes here so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
