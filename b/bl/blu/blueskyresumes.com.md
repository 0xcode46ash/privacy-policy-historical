# Blue Sky Resumes : Privacy Policy

We understand the confidential nature of a job search. We will never sell or disclose your personal information to **anyone**. We retain a copy of your resume on file so that we are able to provide update services, but we will never distribute your resume to anyone unless you have given us your written permission. 

As an ongoing service, we stay in contact with our clients regarding job opportunities and/or useful career development information. You can opt to stop receiving these news bulletins at any time by simply replying with "unsubscribe" in the subject heading of your e-mail. 

As a service to our clients and visitors, we provide links to other websites. We can make no representations about the privacy policies of these sites. If you are concerned about confidentiality, you should check each site before providing information.

We use third-party web beacons from Yahoo! to help analyze where visitors go and what they do while visiting our website. Yahoo! may also use anonymous information about your visits to this and other websites in order to improve its products and services and provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you.
