When Blue Nile posts changes to this statement, you will see the word "Updated" next to the Privacy Policy link on the Blue Nile home page. Blue Nile encourages you to periodically review this page to be informed of how we are protecting your information. If you have questions or concerns about policy changes, you should first contact the Blue Nile customer service department at [serviceuk@bluenile.co.uk](mailto:serviceuk@bluenile.co.uk) or 0800 358 1981 from the United Kingdom, 1800 944 544 from Ireland, or +353 1 487 7850 for all other EU countries. 

Your privacy is important to us. This privacy policy is designed to inform you of what information Blue Nile collects, why we collect such information and how we use the information we collect. 

## 

In general, you can browse our Web Site without telling us who you are or revealing any personally identifiable information about yourself. Personally identifiable information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name; home, billing or other physical address; an email address; phone number or other contact information; and a credit card number and expiration date. When you submit your personally identifiable information to us, you are giving us your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this privacy policy. 

As a policy, Blue Nile does not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so. 

**Communications:** If you provide Blue Nile with personally identifiable information, this information may be used to communicate to you information regarding Blue Nile and its products and services. For example, we may communicate to you information regarding promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes or product or service updates. Your personally identifiable information may also be used to improve and customise our Web Site's content, layout and services. These uses improve and customise our interactions with you to better meet your needs. 

In addition to the uses set forth above, if you contact one of our diamond and jewellery consultants (and provide personally identifiable information to the consultant) or submit a request or inquiry through our Web Site, we will use your information to respond to your inquiry or request and to provide you with any other additional information that we believe may be helpful or interesting to you. 

If you place an order with Blue Nile, in addition to the uses set forth above, we will use your personally identifiable information to confirm your order, prevent and detect fraud or abuse, respond to your requests or inquiries, provide you with other administrative information regarding your order and provide you with any other information we deem helpful or interesting to you. 

If you do not want to receive communications from Blue Nile you may elect to opt-out of receiving such communications; please see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below for more information. 

**Internal Use** : We may compare and review your personally identifiable information for errors, omissions and accuracy. We may also use your personally identifiable information internally to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, Web Site content and product offerings. Your personally identifiable information may also be used internally to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, behavior and generally to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our Web Site and our marketing programs. 

**Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection** : We may collect and disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may collect and possibly share personally identifiable information and any other information available to us in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any personal or as otherwise required by law. We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organisations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction. 

**Service Providers** : We may share your personally identifiable information with authorised third party partners, agents and contractors. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. Examples of other third parties that we may share your personal information with include: webhosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fulfill product orders), jewellers, assemblers, data analysis firms, affiliates, third party consulting or marketing firms and e-mail service providers. Additionally, if you use a credit card or other financing alternative to place an order with Blue Nile, to confirm and process your order we will share your personally identifiable information with such financing company. These third parties only receive personally identifiable information if such information is needed to perform their function(s), and they are not authorised to use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose(s) other than the purpose(s) set forth by Blue Nile. We only provide third-parties with the minimum amount of personally identifiable information necessary to complete the requested service, product or transaction. 

**Special Events** : If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a promotion, contest or sweepstake), Blue Nile may share your personally identifiable information with those organisations participating in the applicable event. Typically, these third parties do not use your information for any other purpose other than to manage the event. In some cases these third-party partners may send you promotional materials regarding their products and services. In these cases, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out, and not have your personally identifiable information shared with that third-party partner. 

If at any time you choose to enter a Blue Nile feedback contest and allow us to post your feedback on our Web Site, we will remove your feedback from our Web Site at any time if you send your request via e-mail to [serviceuk@bluenile.co.uk](mailto:serviceuk@bluenile.co.uk). Send this Product to a Friend: When you e-mail a product to a friend, you and your friend's names and e-mail addresses are requested. This ensures that your friend will know that you have requested that Blue Nile send them an e-mail. You and your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted. 

**Business Transfer** : Your personally identifiable information may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, in which personally identifiable information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the Company. International Transfers: Information collected on this Web Site may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Blue Nile or its affiliates, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities and by using this Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
