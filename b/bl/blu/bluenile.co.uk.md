Your name and address will not be sold to mailing-list firms.

**Site Usage Tracking and Analysis**   
Blue Nile, Inc. has contracted with a third party, Omniture, Inc. and/or its authorized partner or reseller, to provide additional tracking and analysis of information and data collected from visitors to our Web site. 

No personally identifying information is tracked by Omniture. Omniture does not use names, addresses, e-mail addresses, or telephone numbers and does not link any online actions or cookies to a person. 

Blue Nile collects your IP address, which cannot be used to identify you, to help diagnose problems with its server, and uses it internally to administer and tune the operation of its site, and to log your browser type and referring URL information. Blue Nile's servers use each IP address to anonymously track the date and duration of each session within its site. Your IP address may also be used to help Blue Nile collect statistical data or in gathering broad usage information. Certain parts of this information may be shared with Blue Nile partners, but your IP address will not be distributed. 

  
Blue Nile offers customers many ways to keep up to date with the latest product offerings and promotions. Below, we outline how we treat the information you provide to Blue Nile. 

**Sending this Product to a Friend**   
When you e-mail a product to a friend, you and your friend's names and e-mail addresses are requested. This ensures that your friend will know that you have requested that Blue Nile send them an e-mail. You and your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose, and neither of you will be subscribed to future news. You can subscribe to future news from Blue Nile by selecting the appropriate box. 

**Surveys**   
Blue Nile occasionally requests information from our users and customers via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary, and all participants have a choice whether or not to disclose information. The requested information typically includes the customer's first name, as well as information relating to the customer's experience at Blue Nile, or their opinions on products they have purchased. Survey information will be used internally to monitor or improve this site, and after attaining user permission, may be posted on the site to provide information about our products to other users. Users' personally identifying information is not shared with third parties unless Blue Nile gives prior notice and choice.
