# Bluemercury Privacy Policy: Beauty, Makeup, Skin Care, Laura Mercier, Trish McEvoy, Molton Brown, Bobbi Brown, Hair, Perfume, Bluemercury

**What our Privacy Policy Covers**

This Privacy Policy covers any personal information that Bluemercury obtains from you when you use services or features on the sites we own and control, including www.Bluemercury.com and any other site related to Bluemercury (the "Sites"). We may add additional Sites from time to time as we expand our offerings and this policy will govern those new Sites when added. You may be accessing our Sites from a computer or mobile phone device (through a smartphone application, for example) and this policy governs your use of our Sites regardless of the means of access. We also like to interact with you on third party sites where we post content or invite your feedback, such as www.facebook.com/Bluemercury, www.twitter.com/Bluemercury, http://blog.Bluemercury.com and www.youtube.com/Bluemercury editor ("Third Party Sites"). This policy does not cover the privacy practices of those Third Party Sites, or of companies that Bluemercury does not own or control, or the actions of people that Bluemercury does not employ or manage. You should check the privacy policies of those third parties when providing personally identifiable information through Third Party Sites. Our terms of use for the Sites give you more information about how we can interact with you via Third Party Sites. 

Our Privacy Policy may change in the future. We invite you to check back periodically to see if we have made any changes. If we make any material changes, we will post a notice on our home page and will obtain your consent if the material changes affect the way we use the personally identifiable information we have already collected from you. By using the Sites, you agree to the terms of our Privacy Policy. If you do not like the terms of our Privacy Policy, you should not use our Sites. For more information about the terms of use for this site, please visit our Terms of Use page 

**What Personal Information is Collected**  
Depending on how you use Bluemercury Sites, we may ask you to share personal information with us. _Whether you choose to give Bluemercury information is completely up to you, but keep in mind that if you withhold information, you may not be able to use some of our services._

**When Personal Information is Collected**  
Bluemercury will ask you for information, including some personal information, if you use one of several services: 

**Becoming a registered user.** In order to register, you need to share some personal information, such as your name and e-mail address. You do not have to be a registered user to visit the Sites. But, you will have to register if you want to place orders or make full use of our services. Once you register, you will have an account with Bluemercury and a password to access that account. You may never use another person's account without permission and you may not use anyone else's password. You should keep your registration current and complete. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. Please also let us know if there is any unauthorized use of your account or password. We recommend that you always log out from your account at the end of a session with us to prevent other people from accessing your account without your permission.

**Making a purchase.** When you buy something on Bluemercury.com, you have to supply a billing address, phone number, shipping address, and credit card information. By making a purchase, you become a registered user of Bluemercury.com. You can choose to store information needed to make a purchase, such as your credit card number, shipping and billing addresses in the My Account - Profile page. If you change your mind about storing this information, you can amend or delete it by going to the relevant area of the My Account-Profile page and following the instructions. You can access this section using your registration password.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Surveys.** If you enter a sweepstakes or contest, or answer a survey, you will become a registered user (if you aren't one already). We may also ask you for some demographic information, such as your age. If you choose not to answer, you probably will not be able to participate in the sweepstakes, contest or survey.

**Our interactive services.** We have a number of ways to hear your opinions and feedback. We like to answer your questions. We offer several interactive services, Ratings and Reviews and customer profile services. We may offer other interactive services in the future and this Privacy Policy will govern your use of those services. If you want to use any of these interactive services, you will become a registered user (if you aren't already one) and any personal information you submit will become part of your profile, as maintained by Bluemercury. Please review our terms of use for the Sites because they explain the way you can participate in our interactive services in more detail.

**Our Ratings and Reviews or customer profile services.** When you use the Ratings and Reviews or the customer profile services you will become a registered user (if you aren’t already one) and any personal information you submit will become part of your profile, as maintained by Bluemercury.

**Public Information.** Please note that if you choose to share information about yourself in an open format, such as through a Third Party Site like Facebook or Twitter or in the user-generated content elements of our own Sites, we consider that information to be public information - and not personal information.

**Gift Card Information**. Please note that if you choose to purchase a Gift Card from Bluemercury, you may be able to use it online only if it contains a Scratch-Off Personal Identification Number (PIN).  A prepaid Bluemercury Gift Card is redeemable for store merchandise or services sold at Bluemercury or online stores. Bluemercury Gift Cards is not redeemable for cash and will not be replaced or replenished if lost, stolen, damaged or used without your permission unless required by law. This card is valid only if it is activated by the cashier or through online replenishment services. Your use of a Bluemercury Gift Card constitutes acceptance of these terms & conditions. For inquiries on your balance please call 1-888-797-0455 or visit www.bluemercury.com.

**How Bluemercury Protects Your Information**  
We realize that our customers trust us to protect their personal information. We take that task seriously. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. For example: 

We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to guarantee the confidentiality of online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet help protect your online transaction information from third party interception. 

  * We never display your full credit card number once it has been entered. We will only reveal the last four digits of your credit card for verification purposes. 
  * We urge you to protect your own privacy. We recommend that you do not share your password with anyone or share your password in an unsolicited phone call or e-mail. 



Unfortunately, despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. For example, we cannot ensure the security of your data during transmission to us or the security of your data on a smartphone (or other telephone device that can use online applications) or on your Twitter page or on another computer. This reality is true of all Internet or data transmission use. As a result, we cannot ensure the security of any information you transmit, and you transmit all information at your own risk. 

**How Bluemercury Uses Your Personal Information**  
Bluemercury collects personal information primarily to make our services more rewarding for you to use. We usually use this information for internal purposes, such as studying our customers' preferences. We may also use your information to contact you for account and promotional purposes. 

In the event that another company buys the assets or stock of Bluemercury.com, your personal information may then belong to another entity. 

**How to Avoid Receiving Newsletters, Promotional Advertisements and Other Bluemercury.com Materials**  
We use e-mail addresses to send out newsletters and other announcements with information about Bluemercury.com's new products, gifts and special features. When you register, you can choose not to receive these announcements by opting-out of delivery. If you receive an e-mail and want to avoid further messages, look at the end of the e-mail for instructions on how to remove yourself from the mailing list. You can also edit your e-mail preferences at Bluemercury.com's My Account - Profile. 

**Who Views Your Personal Information**  
Bluemercury may share your personal information with companies that perform services for us, such as fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mails, analyzing customer data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, investigating fraudulent activity, conducting customer surveys, and providing customer service. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not disclose your personally identifiable information for other purposes. 

Some personal information is stored on servers owned by other companies. Only Bluemercury has the right to access this information. 

We currently share aggregate information about our customers with advertisers and marketing partners. This information does not identify individual users. 

Any personal information that you include in your profile or in any content submitted when using our Interactive Services like Ratings and Reviews or customer profile services or through Third Party Sites will be displayed on our Sites, so please consider this before submitting any such content. Please don't submit any information that you don't want the whole world to know! 

Personal information may be disclosed if required by law. 

Bluemercury does not currently sell or license personal information. Before selling or licensing your personal information, we will post a notice in this Privacy Policy and on our home page. 

At this time, Bluemercury does not share any personal information with its affiliates. It is possible that this policy will change in the future. If we do decide to share information with our affiliates, we will post a notice in this Privacy Policy and on our home page. 

**Bluemercury's Use of Web Beacons**  
We have included web beacons on some of our web pages. Bluemercury uses web beacons to transfer data (such as purchase and site usage history). Bluemercury may provide this data to companies that assist Bluemercury in data research and analysis; these companies are prohibited from using this data for any other purpose. The analysis and research helps Bluemercury to determine customer preferences and improve Bluemercury's offerings. Bluemercury may also rely upon third parties to assist with the use and implementation of the web beacons. 

Definition of web beacon: A _web beacon_ , sometimes called a pixel, is a graphic image or small string of code, that is included on web pages or in an email to enable the transfer of data. Web beacons can be used by companies for several purposes such as reporting web site traffic, customer preferences, advertising effectiveness, and general auditing. 

  
**Making a Purchase**  
When you buy something on Bluemercury.com, you have to supply a billing address, phone number, shipping address, and credit card information. By making a purchase, you become a registered user of Bluemercury.com. You can choose to store information needed to make a purchase, such as your credit card number, shipping and billing addresses in the My Account - Profile page. If you change your mind about storing this information, you can amend or delete it by going to the relevant area of the My Account-Profile page and following the instructions. You can access this section using your registration password. 

**Children Under 13**  
We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998. If you are under the age of 13, you can look at our Sites, but you cannot make a purchase. You also cannot become a registered user, or use any service on our Sites that asks for personal information. Our Sites are not designed for children. We do not wish to collect personal information from children under 13. 

This policy is designed to protect children. Federal law requires us to take special steps to safeguard children's privacy. For more information about this federal law and about children's privacy, [click here](http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/childrens.html). 

If you register with us and we discover that you are under 13, we will delete your registration. We will send you a message if we do this. If you are under 13 and want to make a purchase, please ask a parent to place the order for you. 

**Cookies on Bluemercury.com**  
We collect some anonymous information about how you use the site by setting and accessing cookies on your computer. These cookies track information such as how often you visit our web site, what pages you view, and where you go after you leave the site. The cookies track your computer, not you. They are not connected to any personal information about you. 

  * **What is a cookie?**



A cookie is a very small file sent to your browser by Bluemercury.com's web server. A cookie placed by Bluemercury.com is uniquely yours and can be read only by our server. 

The information saved in Bluemercury.com's cookies is anonymous because we do not store your personal information in your cookie. We do link the visitor ID (from your cookie) to a user ID in our database for the purpose of analyzing web traffic and statistics only. We also cannot use cookies to access files on your hard drive. The cookie is only a means of identifying your browser. 

  * **What does a cookie do?**



It tells our server that your browser returned to the Bluemercury.com web site. The cookie does not collect personally identifiable information. So, for example, Bluemercury.com uses cookies to collect data about how many different browsers visit our web pages every day. 

  * **Why should I accept cookies?**



Cookies also help us keep track of your preferences. For example, cookies allow us to track your order as you shop on Bluemercury.com. Cookies allow us to identify you if you are a registered user and provide you with your account information. 

  * **Why does Bluemercury.com use cookies?**



It allows us to be more efficient. We can learn what information is important to our visitors, and what information isn't. Also, we can spend more time working on the parts of our web site that interest our visitors the most. 

  * **How do I decide not to accept cookies?**



You can order your browser to accept all cookies or to alert you every time a cookie is offered. If you choose to have your browser alert you every time, then you can decide whether to accept that particular cookie or not. For instructions, look at your browser's Help menu. 

  * **Where can I find cookies stored on my hard drive?**



Cookies are usually collected together in one file on your hard drive. Look at your browser's Help menu or the Help file for your operating system to locate this file on your computer. 

  * **How do I delete cookies stored on my hard drive?**



You can delete a cookie like any other file on your computer. So, if you are using a Windows operating system, simply drag the cookie file to the Recycle Bin. 

**Social Commerce and Other Third Parties**  
We work with trusted third parties, including social network sites like Facebook, and with application developers who specialize in social commerce so we can connect to your social networks. Other social networks we use include Twitter. All of these companies operate Third Party Sites. We provide access to our Sites by third parties and business partners so we can generate interest in our products among members of your social networks and to allow you to share product interests with friends in your network.

The use of any features made available to you on our Sites by a third party may result in information being collected or shared about you by us or by the third party. Information collected or shared through any such third party features is considered "public information" by us because the Third Party Sites made it publicly available. If you do not want us to be able to access information about you from Third Party Sites, you must instruct Third Party Sites not to share the information. We cannot control how your data is collected, stored, used or shared by Third Party Sites or to whom it is disclosed. Please be sure to review the privacy policies and privacy settings on your social networking sites to make sure you understand the information they are sharing. If you do not want a Third Party Site to share information about you, you must contact that site and determine whether it gives you the opportunity to opt out of sharing such information. Bluemercury is not responsible for how these third parties may use information collected from or about you. However, we do identify any areas on our Sites where third parties share information about you.

Facebook's "Like" feature is a good example. (Other third parties have or may have similar ways for you to express positive opinions about our products - now or in the future.) We have agreed to allow Facebook's "Like" feature to run alongside images of our products so you can "like" one of our products and to see how many other Facebook users "like" each of our products. You should know that Facebook may collect or register the fact that you "like" a product and may post that information to your "News Feed" on Facebook and to your Facebook profile's "Wall" and "Info" pages. So, the fact that you "like" one or more of our products may be made known to members of your Facebook network. This would be true for your friends too. If they "like" one of our products, you will see it on his or her News Feed, Wall or Info pages. Finally, by "liking" one of our products, you consent to the display of that information by us. If you do not wish this to happen, you should not click that you "like" a product and you should review your privacy settings on Facebook (or similar Third Party Site). Note that we are not obligated to display someone's name, profile photo or other "public" Facebook profile information on our website even if that Facebook user "likes" one of our products. We reserve the right to remove the information of any person which we deem to be inconsistent with our ideals or otherwise inappropriate for public association with our company. We may remove from our Sites, in our sole discretion, any product offering or any photo or product description relating thereto.

We may decide to sell products through Facebook (or comparable store on another Third Party Site) in the future. If we sell products through Facebook, and you "connect" with Facebook (using Facebook Connect or other connecting application) to Bluemercury’s presence on the Sites, you may be able to browse to discover which products are "liked" by your Facebook friends and by the larger Facebook community. If you are a Facebook user and you say that you "like" a product on our Sites or that you "like" Bluemercury, Bluemercury may then request that Facebook make your name, Facebook photo and other public profile information under the terms of Facebook's privacy policy. This information may then be displayed alongside the product on our Sites to indicate that you "like" the product. The actual information that may be displayed will vary depending on what information is made publicly available on Facebook.com. Bluemercury may collect and keep your Facebook profile identification only as long as is needed.
