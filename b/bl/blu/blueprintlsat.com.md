# Blueprint Privacy Policy

Blueprint may send you emails about Blueprintâ€™s products, promotions, or services or important information regarding your class or lessons. A user's personally identifiable information will not be transferred to a party outside Blueprint unless stated at the time of collection. 

We do not control the privacy policies of our advertisers, sponsors or other sites to which we provide hyperlinks. www.blueprintprep.com users should also be aware that, when they voluntarily disclose personal information in chat areas or bulletin boards, that information may be collected by others and may result in unsolicited messages from others.

Technology on the Internet is developing at a rapid pace, and we need to maintain our flexibility in the online arena. If we need to change our policy in the future, we will post these changes as soon as they go into effect.

Please direct questions and/or concerns about this policy to Blueprint at [info@blueprintprep.com](mailto:info@blueprintprep.com).
