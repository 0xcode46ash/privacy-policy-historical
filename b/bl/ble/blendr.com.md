# Blendr - Blendr Privacy Policy

[](https://web.archive.org/) [What is Blendr?](http://blendr.com/what-is-blendr) [Get Blendr](http://blendr.com/get-blendr) [Blog](http://blendr.com/blendr-blog) [Press](http://blendr.com/press) [Help](http://help.blendr.com/) [Contact](http://blendr.com/contact)

Blendr offers a suite of privacy options for a friend-making experience that you can adjust to fit your needs.

Blendr does not leave a trail like other sites and social networks.

Blendr uses the GPS technology in your device or the WiFi in the iPod touch to determine your exact location and instantly connect you with people in your area.

You do not have to provide any information about yourself. You can remain 100% anonymous if desired. No photo or any details about yourself are required to start using Blendr. Youâ€™ll probably get more responses from nearby people by including a photo and filling out your interests, but the information you share is totally your choice.

Blendr does not ask for your email address, require account registration, or use a complicated validation process. After downloading, you can open the app and start chatting with people near you in seconds.

Blendr allows users 18 years and older only.

##  Blendr Privacy Policy

By accessing the Blendr service you acknowledge that you have read, understand, and agree to the following privacy policy. In order for Blendr to work with your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad we must collect your Device Identification Code or "DIC". The DIC is a special type of identifier used in software applications in order to provide a unique reference number for applications like those used by your mobile device. Your DIC is not shared with other users.

You understand that when you use Blendr, certain information you post or provide on Blendr may be shared with other users, including without limitation your profile, comments, photographs and locations. In addition, you understand that use of Blendr may include the disclosure and display of your location/distance data to other users. Blendr users can use the search feature to search for other members by different criteria, like interests. The information that you enter into your profile will be used for these searches. Please note that if you choose to show your location, the information that is provided to Blendr about your distance will be used within your profile and can be viewed and searched by other Blendr users.

We do not share any of your personal information with any third parties other than our advertising display partners such as Admob, Inc and analytics partners such as Flurry. With these third parties we may share the following pieces of information: 1) your DIC, 2) your location, 3) your gender, 4) your age. Further, information gathered when an ad request is made is not shared by those third party partners with specific advertisers. Some of our ad partners may target ads based on user behavior. Apple Inc.'s iAd network allows users to opt out of behavioral targeting by visiting [http://oo.apple.com](http://oo.apple.com/) from your iOS4 device.

We will not otherwise disclose any personal information without your consent, except: in response to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process; to establish or exercise our rights to defend against legal claims; if we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, safety of person or property, violation of our policies, or as otherwise required by law.
