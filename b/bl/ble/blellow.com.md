# Privacy Policy | Blellow: A Productivity Microblog for Professionals

This Privacy Policy is posted to inform our users of our policies and procedures regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information received from users of this website, located at [www.blellow.com](http://www.blellow.com/) (”Site” ). We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time and for any reason. All members will be notified of any changes that we make to our Privacy Policy, but as a best practice, we recommend that all members visit this page regularly to monitor any changes.

By using our site, you are agreeing to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy and any future iterations. Any questions, concerns or comments you have about our use of your personally identifiable information or this policy may be directed to us at [admin@blellow.com](mailto:admin@blellow.com)

**The Information We Collect**

In  order to provide you with the products and services that we make available on our site and give you access to the full functionality of Blellow.com, we will collect some personally identifiable information, including but not limited to: IP Address, user name, password, email address, city, time zone, telephone number, and any and all other information that you share with us or make visible on your public profile.

**Additional Information**

Providing additional information beyond the initial required registration information is entirely optional, but can help you have a better experience within the Blellow community. Any additional information you provide including mobile or pager numbers, website URLs and other website information may also be collected. In the event that you contact Blellow.com for any reason, we will maintain records of your correspondence and the email address you used for that correspondence.

**Contact Information and Sharing**

We will never sell or give any of the information we collect on our site or through any personal correspondence to a third-party entity. We reserve the right to use that information, however, to market any additional Blellow.com services and products to you. You will always have the right to opt out of this type of communication by following the unsubscribe instructions included in any of the marketing emails we send you.

**IP Address Use**

When you log in to Blellow.com we will collect your browser type and IP address. We may also store some information about your browser using “cookies”. A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user’s computer tied to information about the user. We use session ID cookies to confirm that users are logged in. If you wish to disable the use of cookies, you may do so by adjusting the settings in your browser.

**Law and Law Enforcement Compliance**

Blellow will cooperate with government and law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. This includes the disclosure of any information we have collected about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, at our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect the property and rights of Blellow or a third party, the safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to comply with the law.

**Security**

At Blellow, we are very concerned and sensitive to the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We use various security measures to both protect our site and keep your information as safe as possible.

Should a breach of security occur, we will make any legally required disclosures of the breach as soon as possible, while still taking in to account any legitimate needs of law enforcement or measures necessary to restore the security and integrity of our system. Any notification of breach will occur in a private email correspondence with affected members or in a highly visible forum within the Blellow interface itself.

**Links to Other Websites**

On Blellow.com, we encourage our members to share links to other websites. This does not in any way speak as an endorsement, authorization or representation of our affiliation with that third party. We strongly advise our members to be aware of and review any privacy or terms of use made available by these third party sites, as we have no control over their ability to insert cookies or their collection/solicitation of your personally identifiable information. Any links that are found to link to sites that promote illegal or pornographic activity, however, will be removed. Until we have an integrated system in place for the reporting of these links, members may email us with their concerns about any link on our site at [admin@blellow.com](mailto:admin@blellow.com)

**Children Under the Age of 13**

While we have not designed Blellow.com to be a site for children, we will not prevent a child from joining. If a parent or legal guardian becomes aware that his or her child has created an account with us and provided us personally identifiable information without their parental consent, he or she should contact us at [admin@blellow.com](mailto:admin@blellow.com). We will not knowingly collect or store information from children under the age of 13. If we become aware that such information is being stored, we will immediately delete it from our files.
