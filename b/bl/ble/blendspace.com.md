### **What are cookies?**

Cookies are harmless text files that allow a website server to recognise you when you revisit the website. There are two main types of cookies:

Transient (or session) cookies.

| 

These are set and exist for the duration of your visit to a specific website and are removed when you finish.  
They recognise you as you move, and navigate between, the different website pages so that you do not need to re-enter who you are and often can help to maintain your security.  
  
---|---  
  
Persistent (or permanent) cookies.

| 

These remain on your computer until they expire or are deleted.  
Many persistent cookies have automatic deletion dates to help ensure your computer doesn't get overloaded with cookies.  
Persistent cookies will often retain previously entered information to ease and simplify subsequent data input.  
For example: your login user ID or email address.  
  
Like most websites, this website uses both types of cookies to simplify and ease a user';s journey and experience. Cookies can also be 1st (first) or 3rd (third) party cookies:

1st Party :

| 

These are owned and created by us for the website you're viewing.  
  
---|---  
  
3rd Party :

| 

These are owned and created by an independent company. Usually this is a company partnering to provide services to us as owners of the website.  
  
We use both our own (first-party) and partner companies' (third-party) cookies to facilitate and support a simpler and more secure website experience for our users

### **What we use cookies for**

We use cookies to:

  * Gather information on a user';s journey across our sites
  * Ensure your privacy is protected in our secure sites
  * Store your login details for our secure sites
  * Temporarily store input information in any of our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations
  * Store details of your marketing, product and business preferences to improve our targeting to you and enhance your journey through our sites and partner sites
  * Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness (we own the anonymous data collected and don't share it with anyone)  
 



We don't and will never:

  * use cookies to track your Internet usage after leaving one of our sites
  * store personal information in them that others could read and understand
  * sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.

### **Cookies categorised as intrusive**

Cookies can be categorised as being 'intrusive' or not in relation to storing any data items that could potentially identify some aspect of an individual user's identity; whether real or a pseudonym.

Whilst in legal interpretations there are degrees of intrusiveness, TES Global has adopted the more cautious definition where any cookie that has a single identifying data item is categorised as 'intrusive'. All intrusive cookies, whether session or persistent, are stored in encrypted form to protect against any possibility of accidental or unintended disclosure.

### **Changing your cookie settings**

To enable or disable cookies, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the 'Help', 'Tools' or 'Edit' facility). Alternatively, an external resource is available at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) or [www.allaboutcookies.org](https://www.allaboutcookies.org/) providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them.

Please note that if you set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of this website, such as any online services that require registration.

### **Secure online services**

Any secure online services you subscribe to will probably use cookies to enable information about you and your preferences to be stored and to help protect your account and information. In such circumstances, cookies are essential to the service being provided securely and effectively.

If you choose to decline providing consent to use of cookies, it is unlikely that you will be able to continue to use the service.

### **Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations**

A revision of the EU e-Privacy Directive requires that organisations must obtain prior consent from users for the use of cookies, which may be deemed to be intrusive on the user's privacy.

We are currently working towards implementing the new requirements in line with guidance from the United Kingdom Information Commissioner.
