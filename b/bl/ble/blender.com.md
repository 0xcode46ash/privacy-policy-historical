# Privacy Policy

Updated May 12, 2011 

As used herein, “Site” refers to www.maxim.com and other sites on the World Wide Web (including sites designed to be accessed by browsers using Wireless Application Protocol) originating in the United States which are owned and/or operated by Alpha Media Group Inc. (“AMG”). 

By accessing and using the Site, you expressly accept and agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth in the Privacy Policy (“Policy”). If you do not wish to be bound by the Policy, you have no license to use the Site and should leave the Site immediately. 

AMG reserves the right to modify the Policy in any way, at any time. Any and all such modifications will take effect immediately after AMG provides reasonable notice. Notice may be given by posting on the Site, via electronic communication, in writing, and/or any other means that provides reasonable notice. Your further use of the Site after such reasonable notice has been provided constitutes your acceptance of the modified Policy. 

Collection & Use of Information 

1\. Personally-Identifying Information

AMG, directly and through third parties, collects personally-identifying information when you register for the online newsletter or magazine subscriber-only area of the Site, enter contests, and/or participate in other online activities (including, but not limited to, surveys, chat rooms, games, and bulletin boards) throughout the Site. This personally-identifying information may include your name, address (street address, city, state, and zip code), contact information (e.g., e-mail address and telephone numbers), and other identifiers that permit AMG and/or third parties to contact you directly. 

AMG uses personally-identifying information to award prizes and/or, with your permission, for promotional and marketing purposes. AMG uses this information and outside records to offer promotions, products, programs, or services that may be of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive such offers from AMG, please click here. 

AMG may also, from time-to-time, make personally-identifying information available to other companies so that they may also offer promotions, products, programs, and/or services of interest to you. If you prefer not to receive such offers from other companies, please click here. 

AMG may also disclose personally-identifying information in response to legal process, such as a request by law enforcement, a court order or subpoena, or to protect the integrity of the Site if AMG believes that a guest has committed unlawful or otherwise harmful acts. 

If any individual submits content for publication, AMG may publish his or her name and any other information submitted by that individual. 

If guests elect to use the Site’s "E-mail to a Friend" referral service for informing a friend about this Site, AMG asks for the friend's e-mail address and then sends an e-mail inviting the friend to visit the Site. This information is stored by the Site for the sole purpose of sending this e-mail invitation.

2\. Non-Personally-Identifying Information 

AMG, directly and through third parties, collects non-personally identifying information for purposes of site administration and to compile aggregate information about usage of the Site. To learn more about how AMG uses a third party service to collect and use non-personally identifying information on the Site, click here: http://www.nielsen-netratings.com/privacy/sitecensus.htm 

AMG also shares aggregate, non-personally-identifying information with third parties for advertising and promotional purposes. 

3\. Purchase Information 

If you purchase a product from a third party or from the Site, information may be collected from you (possibly including, but not limited to, credit card and contact information) for transfer to and use by third party providers of the product. AMG does not retain this information. Unless otherwise stated, AMG does not have any responsibility in connection with such purchases and all transactions and use of any customer information are the sole responsibility of the product provider. Be sure to review the product provider's privacy policy and contact them directly if you have any questions. They may have privacy terms that differ from AMG's Privacy Policy. 

In addition to the foregoing, AMG may share or disclose personally-identifying information about you to other companies or individuals if any of the following occur: 

i. AMG uses third party service providers to provide products, services or functions on its behalf (such as sending emails or processing credit cards or fulfilling subscriptions). AMG asks these service providers to agree to maintain the confidentiality of your personally-identifying information and not to use such information for any reason except to carry out the purpose(s) for which AMG hired them; 

ii. You have entered a contest or sweepstakes sponsored by a third party and you have agreed to permit the third party to share, disclose or otherwise use personally-identifying information, in which case the information may be shared with that third party for their use as permitted by their respective privacy policies, including direct marketing;? 

iii. AMG needs to protect its legal rights (such as collecting money owed to AMG); 

iv. AMG must comply with applicable laws, regulations, and/or legal or regulatory process; 

v. In connection with a sale, merger, transfer, exchange, or other disposition (of assets, stock, or otherwise) of all or a portion of the business conducted by the Site. 

4\. IP Addresses 

An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider whenever you log on to the Web. When you request pages from the Site, web servers automatically identify and log your computer’s IP address. 

AMG collects guests’ IP addresses only for the purpose of system administration and to report aggregate information to advertisers, corporate affiliates, consultants, and/or third parties who perform a particular service for AMG. AMG does not combine IP addresses with other personally-identifying information or compile any session activity reports by IP address. 

5\. Cookies 

Cookies are pieces of information that a Web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make web-surfing easier for you by saving your passwords, purchases, and preferences while you are online. The use of cookies is an industry standard. You will find them at most major Web sites. 

AMG uses cookies to determine which areas of the Site are popular and which are not. This helps AMG to target ads based on guest interests, and also improve and update the Site based on such data as total number of guests and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. 

A cookie allows AMG to store the personal preferences that you set during each visit to the Site, which in turn speeds up your future activities at the Site. Similarly, the stores hosted by the Site usually use cookies to track which products you have chosen to purchase while shopping. Letting cookies do the record-keeping saves you the trouble of entering information over and over again. If you are a subscriber of Maxim Magazine and have registered to access the subscriber-only portion of the Site, an identifying cookie will be placed on your computer. During future visits to the Site, AMG will only read and retrieve information set in a cookie during an earlier visit to the Site. You may occasionally get cookies from AMG’s advertisers on the Site as well. The Site does not control these cookies, and they are not subject to the Policy. Advertisers do not have access to the Site's cookies. 

The use of advertising cookies sent by third-party servers is standard in the Internet industry. Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies. You may be able to direct your browser to refuse cookies or alert you when cookies are being sent. However, it is possible that some parts of the Site, such as the shopping, contest, and game areas, will not function properly if you do so. 

6\. Third-Party Advertisers 

AMG uses third party advertising companies and advertising networks to serve ads to you on its behalf when you visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number) about your visits to the Site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please visit the following web addresses: http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp? http://www.advertising.com/Privacy.html? http://www.doubleclick.com/us/about_doubleclick/privacy 

Minors 

Minors (individuals under 18 years of age) should always ask parents for permission before providing any personal information online. No information should be submitted to or posted on the Site by any Minor without the consent of a parent or guardian. Unless otherwise disclosed during collection, AMG does not knowingly provide any personally-identifying information about Minors, regardless of its source, to third parties, nor is this information knowingly used by AMG for any marketing or promotional purposes. Minors are not allowed to participate in contests on the Site. 

Public Forums 

Whenever you disclose information online in chat rooms, message boards, or similar posting areas, that information can be viewed, collected, and used by anyone. Therefore, do not disclose any information in such areas that you do not want made available to the general public. AMG is not responsible for the consequences of such disclosures including, but not limited to, unsolicited communications. 

Security 

The Site has implemented appropriate safeguards to help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and to make proper use of the information that AMG collects. Nevertheless, no transmission of data over the Internet can ever be completely secure. Thus, while AMG strives to protect your personal information, it cannot absolutely guarantee the security of any information that you provide. 

Subscriptions 

To unsubscribe from the Maxim Online newsletter and/or other electronic communications from AMG, reply to the e-mail newsletters with “UNSUBSCRIBE” (and only “UNSUBSCRIBE”) in the subject line or follow the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail. You can also unsubscribe from promotional and marketing e-mails that you receive from Site partners by typing “UNSUBSCRIBE” (and only “UNSUBSCRIBE”) in the subject line in a reply to one of the Site partner’s e-mails to you or by following the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the e-mail.
