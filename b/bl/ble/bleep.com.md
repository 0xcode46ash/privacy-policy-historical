# Bleep - Privacy Policy

### Our Policy

Bleep takes the privacy of its customers very seriously, and will only collect information in order to fulfil customer orders and (if requested by the customer) to provide information via our e-mail mail-outs. We never send unsolicited e-mails to customers, and we do not sell mailing lists or customer information to any other companies or individuals.

### Information Collected

To process your order, we require the following data: your name, e-mail address, delivery address (if mail order), and if you store your details with us, your credit card number and expiry date. You are solely responsible for the way you use this data on our site. To receive our new release information e-mails, we only require your e-mail address.

### Security

The shopping cart part of the site is secure, so that your order details are encrypted in your browser before they are sent to us. The order is then processed on a server that is not connected to the Internet.
