# Bdsmlr Privacy - Bdsmlr - Share your favorite BDSM images online!

Thank you for using Bdsmlr! This page helps you to understand our policies.

### What information do we collect?

We collect information in two ways:

#### 1\. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it.

When you sign up for or use our products, you voluntarily give us certain information. This can include your name, profile photo, pins, comments, likes, email address you used to sign up, and any other information you provide us. If you're using Bdsmlr on your mobile device, you can also choose to provide us with location data.

You also may give us permission to access your information in other services. For example, you may link your Facebook or Twitter account to Bdsmlr, which allows us to obtain information from those accounts (e.g., your friends or contacts). The information we obtain from those services often depends on your settings or their privacy policies, so be sure to check what those are.

#### 2\. We get technical information when you use our products.

These days, whenever you use a website, mobile application, or other Internet service, there's certain information that almost always gets created and recorded in an automated way. The same is true when you use our products, and here are some of the types of information we collect in this way.

Log Data. When you use Bdsmlr, our servers automatically record information about your interaction with our products ("log data"), including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website or your mobile app sends when you use it to access Bdsmlr. This log data may include your Internet Protocol address, the address of the web page you were visiting before you came to Bdsmlr, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, and how you used Bdsmlr.

Depending on how you're accessing our products, we may use "cookies" (a small text file sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Bdsmlr account or your browser), or similar technologies to record log data. When we use cookies, we may use "session" cookies (that last until you close your browser) or "persistent" cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we may use cookies to store your language preferences or other Bdsmlr settings so you don't have to set them up every time you visit Bdsmlr.

Device Information. In addition to log data, we may also collect information about the device you're using Bdsmlr on, including what type of device it is, what operating system you're using, device settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. Whether we collect some or all of this information often depends on what type of device you're using and its settings. For example, different types of information are available depending on whether you're using a Mac or a PC, or an iPhone or an Android phone. To learn more about what information your device makes available to us, please also check the policies of your device manufacturer or software provider.
