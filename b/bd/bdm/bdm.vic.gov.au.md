# Privacy - Births, Deaths & Marriages Victoria

## You are here:

This page contains the Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages Victoria (BDM) Website Privacy Statement. You can also read BDM’s [Privacy policy](https://web.archive.org/utility/about+bdm/legislation+and+policies/privacy+policy/privacy+policy).

## **Website privacy statement**

BDM, as part of the Department of Justice and Regulation (the department) values the privacy of every individual and is committed to handling personal and health information (as defined in the Department’s [Information Privacy Policy](http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/home/your+rights/privacy/department+of+justice+information+privacy+policy/ "Department of Justice Information Privacy Policy")) in accordance with the privacy principles contained in the _Privacy and Data Protection Act 2014_ (Vic). Protecting your privacy by handling your personal information in this manner is an important aspect of our activities.

This Website Privacy Statement only applies to websites, web services and electronic addresses operated, maintained or administered by the department under the domain names [bdm.vic.gov.au](http://bdm.vic.gov.au/) and [justice.vic.gov.au](http://www.justice.vic.gov.au/). It also includes the Medical Certificate Cause of Death sites hosted on forms.business.gov.au. It explains how your personal information will be handled by the department when you access and interact with its websites and web services.

This Website Privacy Statement does not apply to any linked or other websites, web services and electronic addresses. Examples of web services include identity and document verification services (e.g. Veda Advantage, Cert Valid), social-networking services (e.g. Facebook), wikis (e.g. Wikipedia), blogs, micro-blogs (e.g. Twitter) and web feed services (e.g. RSS feed). If you register or use a mobile application which collects personal information, the terms and conditions associated with the application (if any) will govern how that personal information is managed.  The department recommends that you read any terms and conditions (including any privacy statement or policy) that apply to any web service as any such terms and conditions relating to the handling of your personal information by the web service will prevail over this privacy statement.
