# Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages - Privacy

| 

  


The Victorian Registry of Births, Deaths and Marriages ('the Registry') is committed to upholding the privacy requirements of the _Births Deaths and Marriages Registration Act 1996_ and other relevant legislation.

This Privacy Statement ('the Statement') applies to the Registry's website which is operated by the Department of Justice. It outlines the personal information collected through this website, indicates why the information is collected and how it will be used.

## Personal information

Personal information may be collected via the website including, but not limited to: 

  * name, address and contact details 
  * details relating to a birth, marriage, death or change of name recorded by the Registry 
  * credit and debit card details 
  * details of a birth or death in Victoria provided by specific secure account holders pursuant to their statutory obligations 
  * messages, comments or feedback via the Registry's online Feedback form.



The Registry also collects information through WebTrends designed to track the number of unique visitors to the website. The information collected by WebTrends does not identify a user.

## How and why personal information is collected on this website

The Registry will request personal information when the user is applying for certificates or uncertified images online. The Registry will also request personal information when a user is completing the Registry's online Feedback form or registering to become a secure user of this site (such as a funeral director or hospital).

The Registry collects personal information through online applications to enable the provision of products and services. Personal information collected through the online Feedback form is used to provide advice, respond to positive and negative feedback and enhance the Registry’s services.

## Use and disclosure of personal information

In addition to the uses outlined above, the Registry may also use or disclose personal information for additional purposes including: 

  * the Registry’s research, planning, product and service development, security and testing 
  * the operation, administration, development or enhancement of this website 
  * any other purposes required by law.



Card payment details provided online are released to an electronic payments service provider. Once payment is processed, the Registry will issue an online receipt for your records.

## Security

All pages where personal information is requested or uploaded (including payment details) are protected by 128-bit SSL encryption. Most browsers will display a padlock symbol at the bottom of the browser window when visiting a page that is secured by SSL encryption.

Once any personal information is received by the Registry, all reasonable steps are taken to protect that information from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. While the Registry strives to protect personal information, the Registry cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information transmitted online and individuals do so at their own risk.

If you have any concerns about conveying sensitive material over the Internet, you can [contact the Registry](https://web.archive.org/CA2574F700805DE7/page/About+us-Contact+us?OpenDocument&1=70-About+us~&2=70-Contact+us~&3=~).

## Cookies

In addition to data collected by WebTrends, the Registry's website also uses cookies for some parts of this website.

Most browsers will allow some or all cookies by default. However, you can take steps to erase cookies, block cookies or receive a warning before a cookie is stored, by altering your own browser's cookies settings (usually through the Tools options).

Some parts of the Registry's website may not function fully for users who disallow cookies.

## Links to external websites

This Privacy Statement does not extend beyond this website. The Registry recommends that users read the Privacy Statements of any external websites that the Registry may provide a link to. The Registry does not accept responsibility for any privacy measures which may be taken on any linked websites.
