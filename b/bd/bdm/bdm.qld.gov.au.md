 **Cookies**

Our website is a cookie-free site. When you visit this website, our server makes a record of your visit and logs the following information for statistical purposes only - the user's server address, the user's top level domain name (for example .com, .gov, .au, etc), the date and time you visited the site, the pages accessed and documents downloaded, the previous site visited and the type of browser you use.

No attempt is or will be made to identify users or their browsing activities except, in the unlikely event of an investigation, where a law enforcement agency may exercise a warrant to inspect activity logs.

 **What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a message given to a web browser by a web server. The browser stores the message in a text file called _cookie.txt_. The message is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.

The main purpose of cookies is to identify users and possibly prepare customised web pages for them. When you enter a website which is using cookies, you may be asked to fill out a form providing such information as your name and interests. This information is packaged into a cookie and sent to your web browser which stores it for later use. The next time you go to the same website, your browser will sent the cookie to the web server. The server can use this information to present you with custom web pages. So, for example, instead of seeing just a generic welcome page, you might see a welcome page with your name on it.

The name _cookie_ derives from UNIX objects called _magic cookies_. These are tokens that are attached to a user or program and change depending on the areas entered by the user or program. Cookies are also sometimes called _persistent cookies_ because they typically stay in the browser for long periods of time.
