# BannerConnect Privacy Policy | BannerConnect - Online Advertising

_This Privacy Policy was last modified on June 23, 2011._

BannerConnect takes online user privacy very seriously and we recommend you fully read this Privacy Policy, explaining how we collect, protect and use information and under what circumstances we share this information.

Please keep in mind when leaving our website or using our services that we have no control over our partners, clients or third parties. When using their website, services or taking advantage of their advertised offers in any way, their privacy policy and terms of agreement apply.

## What we do

BannerConnect is a Display Engine Marketing specialist. We buy and (re)sell online display advertising space, from website publishers to advertisers and agencies. We also manage and optimise advertising campaigns, using different forms of targeting. As part of the targeting process, we collect data about online user behaviour and turn this data into anonymous user profiles.

For more information about behavioural advertising, please visit [youronlinechoices.com](http://youronlinechoices.com/ "Your Online Choices").

## How we collect information

Cookies and pixels allow us to give every device visiting our website or using our services a unique ID. This ID is used to match the collected information to the device without the use of any personally identifiable information.

### What are cookies

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device by your web browser. Cookies do not contain programmes and are only accessed by your web browser. They ensure a user-friendly web experience by storing information about your use of the website and your preferences for features or functions, such as language preferences, privacy settings, shopping baskets or relevant advertisements.

If you want to learn more about cookies, please visit the [Internet Advertising Bureau’s Cookies FAQ](http://www.iabeurope.eu/cookies-faq.aspx "IAB Cookie FAQ").

### What are pixels

Pixels are event-trackers for visitations and actions on a website. A pixel can, for example, register your view of this page or confirm you have bought a product after seeing an advertisement. When a pixel is triggered, it stores its information in the cookie.

### Data from third parties

We may buy data from third parties to expand and update our profile collection or further enrich profiles we already have. As with data collected by BannerConnect, any bought data from third parties does not include personally identifiable information.

## What we collect

**The data we collect does not include any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).** Furthermore, we do not request any information from your device that is unrelated to the use of our website or the use of our services.

The collected information does typically include:

  * Visited website addresses (URLs),
  * Date and time of your visit,
  * The type of browser and operating system used,
  * How often a certain ad is delivered and clicked.



All collected data helps us build a profile on your behaviour, interests and approximate geographical location.

## Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

We do not collect Personally Identifiable Information. Our definition of Personally Identifiable Information is in compliance with the Internet Advertising Bureau’s (IAB) definition:  
We do not collect ‘information that can be traced back to a specific user and provide personal information such as name, phone number, address, etc.’. In other words, it’s information that can identify you as a person rather than an anonymous profile.

**All of our profiles are anonymous and each profile represents a specific browser on a specific device, not a real person.**

## Why we collect data

BannerConnect uses the collected data to increase the effectiveness and performance of advertising campaigns. We match an advertisement to profiles of users who are more likely to be interested in the subject. We believe relevant advertisements can be beneficial to both the user and the advertiser, while providing a less disruptive user experience.

Matching advertisements with individual profiles is a fully automated process and individual profiles are only accessible by a select group of people within BannerConnect. All available data presented internally or externally consists of totals or averages of the aggregated data.

### Disclosure to third parties

We reserve the right to disclose our data to advertisers, clients and partners or others who work on our behalf. The information provided to third parties does not contain personally identifiable information about you.

Third parties are obligated to use the information they receive in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

BannerConnect may also share information when compelled by a governmental agency, law, regulation, a court or other legal process.

## Changes to Privacy Policy

BannerConnect reserves the right to modify, add or delete content in this Privacy Policy at any given time, without notice. When visiting our website or using our services, the terms and conditions of this privacy policy as displayed at that time apply.
