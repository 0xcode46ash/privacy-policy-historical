**Bannerconnect’s Services**

Bannerconnect provides a range of services to its clients, including advertisers and publishers.  Bannerconnect’s services (“Services”) include: media planning, buying and selling; marketing communications planning; campaign analytics and research; ad serving; and data management.  Our clients use our Services in order to show online users the most useful and relevant ads.  We believe that such advertising is a crucial element of the Internet ecosystem, providing information to users and helping to subsidize online content and services.

**Types of Information We Collect through Our Services**

When you view and interact with websites and advertisements operated by our clients, we may collect through our Services information regarding your browsing, usage and interactions.  We may also collect information that allows us to identify browsers we have interacted with previously.  Such information collected by our Services may include the type of Internet browser and computer operating system you use, your computer’s Internet protocol (“IP”) address, the URLs of the websites you visited before and after viewing an advertisement, and information related to websites and web pages you are viewing when an advertisement is shown.

We do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information.  Whenever we refer to “you” or “your”, we are referring to a browser or device and not an identifiable person.

We collect information through the use of cookies, pixels and similar technologies.  A cookie is a small text file that is stored in a browser by a website or ad server which allows that website or ad server to recognize that browser and remember user preferences and other information.  A pixel is a line of code that is used by a website or third party to assign online activities to a computer or browser.  The use of a pixel allows websites and us to record, for example, that a user has visited a particular web page.  Additional information from an earlier period or interaction may be included in the pixel.

**How We Use Information Collected through Our Services**

We use the information collected through our Services to provide you with the most useful and relevant online advertising and to better customize the sort of advertisements you see on those sites.  For example, if we think that a user is interested in apparel options, then our Services may help our clients deliver interest-based online advertisements to you about a particular type of apparel. For example:

We also may use such information to limit the number of times you see a particular ad, and for other purposes such as research, reporting and analysis.

We may also receive from other companies information collected outside the Services for use in connection with the Services on behalf of our clients.  We also do this in order to get a clearer picture of the types of advertisements that might be most relevant and useful to you.  We do not associate such information with your name, mailing address, email address or similar personally identifiable information.

We require our clients to comply with applicable laws governing online privacy. We encourage you to read the privacy policies of the websites you visit to better understand issues relating to your online privacy.

The use of information by our affiliates, clients and service providers is not covered by this privacy policy.

**Disclosure of Information to Third Parties**

We may disclose the information we collect about you (see “Types of Information We Collect through Our Services” above), and information derived from it, to our clients and service providers.  As we do not collect users’ names, mailing addresses, phone numbers, email addresses or similar personally identifiable information through our Services, we do not disclose any such information to third parties.  However, if you affirmatively provide personally identifiable information via one of our clients’ advertisements or websites, then that information will be received by such client and will be subject to that client’s privacy policy.

We also may disclose the information we collect to third parties, including law enforcement, when we reasonably believe we are obligated to do so by law, and in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual prohibited activities, including, but not limited to, fraud and situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person.

**User Choice**

We collect information through our Services through the use of cookies, pixels and similar technologies.  We believe that the use of such technology enables us and our clients to provide users with a more meaningful web experience.

You may adjust your browser settings to refuse or remove cookies.  However, by doing so, you may not be able to use certain features on the websites you visit or take full advantage of all website offerings and interest-based advertising.  You may refuse or remove cookies by following the directions provided in your browser settings.  Further information about cookies is available at [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/).

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect against the unauthorized access to, retention of, and disclosure of data.  This includes undertaking necessary physical, electronic, and management activities required to protect data integrity, access, and use. Any data that is stored on our servers is treated as confidential information.  Please keep in mind, however, that despite these reasonable efforts to protect data on our servers, no method of transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your data at all times, we cannot guarantee its absolute security and shall not be liable for any breach of security by an outside party.

**Data Retention**
