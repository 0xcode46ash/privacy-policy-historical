# BankSimple | Privacy Policy

_Effective as of March 22, 2011_

Hi! We’ve created this Privacy Policy to let you know how banksimple.com uses any information that you provide to us when you visit this site. Before we kick off with legalese, let’s make one thing clear:

**We will never sell, rent or loan any personal information that you provide to us. Simple.**

By visiting this site, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms/ "Terms").

## What information we collect

We collect three main types of information when you visit this site: web usage data, invite requests and sign up tests. In the normal course of browsing the site, we may also collect usage information such as your IP address, browser type, language settings and the URLs of the referring and exit pages. We can also keep track of how much time you spend on the site and what links you click on while visiting banksimple.com. When you request an invite, you have to provide us with your name and email address. We also are offering the opportunity to test our sign up process to a small number of users. From these users we are asking for their Name, Address, Phone Number, Email Address, Date of Birth and Social Security Number.

## How we use cookies

We may also use cookies, which allows us to remember you across multiple visits to our site. We do not use cookies for advertising, nor do we sell cookie data to anyone. In addition to cookies that we might use on the site, others (like Google Analytics) may also serve cookies. If you do not wish cookies to be used in connection with your visit, please disable the cookie function in your browser. However, if you do decide to not accept cookies, the site may not work properly.

## Modifying your information or opting out

If you have provided us with information and would like to make changes to it or how we contact you, please get in touch with us at [support@banksimple.com](mailto:support@banksimple.com).

## What we do with the information we collect

  * We use invite request information to track how many people are interested in our services. When our service becomes available, we will use your email address to inform you of this and extend you an invite to use the service.
  * For those who complete the sign up test, we store the information in our secure servers and use the information to hold your place for when we do begin offering the BankSimple product. By providing us with the information now, you do not need to provide it to us again in the future. The purpose of the test is to evaluate how and who will sign up for our product and we may use your information, in aggregate, to analyze the performance of our sign up process. Completing the sign up test will not result in any credit check against your social security number, nor will it open any financial service accounts on your behalf. When we do begin to offer financial services, all customers will be required to agree to our cardholder agreements before we open any accounts or offer any financial services. At that time we will use your personal information, including your social security number to verify your identity. We will not transmit any individual’s information to our affiliates until customers have provided the appropriate consents in the form of our cardholder agreements.
  * We may, from time to time, share information with our business affiliates, but they operate under strict privacy policies and will not share your information without our permission or unless otherwise required by law. For example, we work with an email service provider that sends emails to people who have requested an invite. To do that, we need to tell them an email address.
  * We use anonymous web usage information to analyze how people use this site and to help direct improvements for the site. We aggregate this information in a way that does not identify you personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents, and other third-parties with which we have a business relationship.
  * If we or any of our affiliated companies are acquired, we expect that the collected information would be transferred along with the other business assets.
  * To the extent permitted by law, we may also disclose the information that we collect (i) when required by law, court order, or other government or law enforcement authority or regulatory agency; or (ii) whenever we believe that disclosing such information is necessary or advisable, for example, to protect the our rights, property, or safety, or those of others.



## How we protect your information

We take commercially reasonable steps to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. We encrypt personal information using AES-256 with 4,096 bit encryption keys. Social security numbers and other personal information are asymmetrically encrypted, with the decryption key kept outside of our production environment. We use industry-standard encryption technology, a secure server, and other physical and procedural safeguards to protect the security of the information that we collect. Please understand, however, that no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the internet. In particular, e-mail may not be secure, and you should therefore take special care in deciding what information you send to us via e-mail.

## This is an American web site

This website is operated in the United States. If you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United States. By using the website and/or providing us with any information, you consent to this transfer.

This website may contain links to third-party websites. We have no control over the privacy practices or the content of these websites. As such, we are not responsible for the content or the privacy policies of those third-party websites.

## Changes to this privacy policy

This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date stated at the top of this Privacy Policy. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time, and will post any changes on the Website as soon as they go into effect. By accessing this website after we make any such changes to this Privacy Policy, you are deemed to have accepted such changes. Please refer back to this Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
