We care about your privacy.  We want to tell you in detail about the privacy policies and practices which we have adopted so  you can feel confident about how we handle the personally identifiable information ("personal information") you entrust to us, and understand how we manage your personal information to offer you the best possible products, services and experiences.  The server(s) that make(s) this site available, and databases where information may be stored, may be located outside the country from which you accessed this site, but we will collect, process and use personal information only in accordance with this policy.  The personal information made available to us may, therefore, be transmitted abroad.  By visiting this site and submitting information, you consent to such collection, processing, transfer and/or storage of your personal information.

We hope that you enjoy our site and will come back often to visit!

We collect personal information, such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, phone numbers, pet information (names, birthdates, vaccination records, etc.), hobby or activity information, demographic information (age, gender, etc.), and the like, when submitted by a visitor.  Visitors may submit personal information online to enter contests, to obtain information or submit a comment, to register for a loyalty program or chat room, to place an order, or to otherwise take advantage of the services offered on our site.  When applying for a job on the site under the Careers section, or recommending a potential employee, visitors may submit personal information.  We may also obtain contact lists, demographic, and other information about you from other sources, and add it to or combine it with our databases.  If a visitor applies for a job listed on the Careers section, or a visitor refers a veterinarian or veterinary technician, we may collect information relevant for evaluating a referral or the visitor's or employment application, which information will be subject to this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions.

You can update or correct your contact information or change your preferences about receiving offers and information from us at any time.  If you are under 13 years of age, you and your parent or guardian must review the section below titled "Policy Regarding Children," which will govern your provision of personally information.

In addition to the information you provide, we also collect automatically generated information. Whenever you visit our site, we receive and store information about that visit. For example, we obtain information about you and your Web browser, including:

  * The Internet Protocol (IP) address that connects your computer to the Internet;
  * Your email address and confirmation when you open an email sent from our site;
  * Your user name(s) and password(s);
  * Your browser type and version, operating system and platform, and other computer and connection information;
  * The date, time and full Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) of your clicks to, through and from our site;
  * Services you search for on our site, view and/or use; and
  * Sections of our site you visit.



There are companies that provide tools that allow you to visit websites anonymously. While use of these tools may prevent us from providing you with personalized service, you should be aware that this option is available.

Special Note on Personal Profiles. After you register with our site, which allows for the creation of personal profiles, you are able to create a personal profile with information that you can make accessible to other users. Your profile can include a variety of information, including a name, e-mail address, physical location, occupation, or other information such as a photo, listing of recent posts you have made, a personal biography, or other personal information. Please be aware that we do not generally monitor or review the information in your profile and the information that you choose to provide will be publicly accessible. Please use caution when deciding on what information to include in your personal profile. We will maintain your personal profile on our servers until such time that you delete or modify that personal profile.

**_What do we do with your personal information?_**

We collect personally identifiable information to provide you access to your pet's health records, to enter you in contests and notify you of results, to e-mail you with updates and news, to respond to your questions or comments, to register you for certain features, to provide personalized content and information, to evaluate a referral or an application for employment, and/or to send out brochures, coupons, samples, offers and other information on our products, services or our company.  We ask visitors providing e-mail addresses to let us know if they would like further information or updates from us or our site. Only those who request it will receive follow-up e-mail or other communications from us.  We also offer visitors an "opt-out" option at any time they wish to cease receiving e-mails or other information from us.

Personal information is used solely by us, and our affiliates, agents, business partners or third party service providers (“Approved Users”) who help make this site and its content, and the products and services at this site available to you, and in some instances, more customized for you; and who provide us data and other information to better serve you.  We provide our Approved Users only with the information they need to perform their services and we require them to protect and keep confidential your information.  Although we use reasonable precautions to ensure that Approved Users protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee complete protection of your personal information to the same extent described in this Privacy Policy.

With respect to employee referrals or job applications, we will hold your application or referral information (and the personal information contained in it) on file for a limited period, whether or not you are offered an interview.  Approved Users may collect, save, process and use your personal information for the purpose of considering your application for employment for a limited period of time (not exceeding two years after submission of any modification).  At any time you may revoke consent with effect from the date such revocation is notified to us pursuant to [Internet.Inquiries@banfield.net](mailto:Internet.Inquiries@banfield.net), except that personal information may be retained longer than the above described two years, if required under applicable law.  To the extent any privacy policy posted on the Careers section of this site, or any click-through privacy policy on the referral or job application screen ("Career Privacy Policy"), if any, conflicts with this Privacy Policy, the Career Privacy Policy will govern.

Without limiting the foregoing, we reserve the right to use or disclose any personal information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to conduct investigations of consumer complaints or possible breaches of law, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any legal investigation. 

**_How do we use "cookies" and web beacons?_**

_What are cookies?_

“Cookies” are data files that a website sends to your computer while you are viewing the site.  These data files include information that allows our site to remember important information that will make your use of the site more efficient and useful.   Our site uses cookies for a variety of purposes.  We use cookie technology and IP addresses to obtain non-personal information from online visitors, and to provide registered visitors with the best possible personalized online experience.

_How do we use cookies?_

Visitors to our site use different web browsers and different computers.  To make your visits as easy as possible with the technology you use, we automatically keep track of the type of browser (e.g., Internet Explorer, Netscape) and operating system (e.g., Windows, Macintosh) used by a visitor, and the domain name of the visitor's Internet service provider.  We also track the total number of visitors to our site in an aggregate form to allow us to update and improve our site.  Personally identifiable information is not extracted in this process.  This data tells us if more visitors prefer certain features or areas to others, which helps us keep our site fresh and interesting.  We also use cookies to help prevent children from entering certain areas or features intended only for adults or older teens.

_How do we use cookies to personalize your experience at our sites?_

Cookie technology helps us assess and deliver content tailored to a visitor’s interests. Sites that offer online shopping use cookies to remember and process the items in your shopping cart.  Where permitted, we may associate personal information with a cookie file in such instances.

_What if you don´t want cookies?_

If you don't want cookies, you can set your computer to warn you each time a cookie is being sent or turn off all cookies through your browser. (Check your browser HELP menu to learn the correct way to change or update your cookies.) If you disable cookies, you may be unable to access some of the features noted above.

_What are web beacons and how do we use them?_

Some of our web pages and e-mail updates may contain electronic images called web beacons, sometimes known as one pixel GIFs, clear GIFs or pixel tags. On websites, these allow us to count visitors who have viewed our pages.  In promotional e-mail messages/newsletters they allow us to count how many subscribers have read them.  Web beacons allow us to develop statistical information about the activities and features that most interest our consumers for the purpose of providing more personalized content. They are not used to access personally identifiable information without your consent.

**_What about chat rooms, message boards, or other interactive forums?_**

We may offer blogs, message or bulletin boards, or interactive areas where visitors may post comments or information for our visitors’ information and enjoyment.  If there is a blog, bulletin or message board, or other interactive areas where personal information may be posted at this site, be sure to check our blogging policy, located at **INSERT LINK TO BLOGGING POLICY** before entering, as you will be bound by them as well as our Terms and Conditions, located at **INSERT LINK TO TERMS AND CONDITIONS**.  Our blogging policy will establish age and other restrictions on participation, and outline requirements for participation. As you know, anything you post online is available for the world to see.  We make no representations and undertake no obligations as to information you voluntarily post.

**_Is credit card / transaction information secure?_**

We care about the safety and security of your transaction.  We use SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) in compliance with the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) to communicate with your browser software when you order from us online and thereby provide us with credit card or similar information.  SSL is the industry standard security protocol, which makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to intercept your credit card / transaction and order information that you send us when you submit your online order.  Otherwise, the transmission of information to and from us is not encrypted or secure.  We take precautions to safeguard your credit card data in our internal systems.

**_What do we do to safeguard personal information?_**

We have instituted safeguards to check that our internal procedures meet our high policy standards.  We also use our best efforts to be sure that third parties who are hired to develop and maintain this site  and to fulfill your orders and requests, agree to protect all personal information they must access in order to serve our site and our visitors, and honor your preferences about contacts you receive.

**_What about links to other websites?_**

We may offer links to other sites. However, we try to link only with websites that share our values. You should always check the privacy policy of any linked website to understand their personal information collection practices, including how they may use cookies. We are not responsible for the content or information collection policies of sites operated by other companies.  If you visit another site, you should review their privacy and other policies.

**_Policy Regarding Children_**

We at Banfield believe it essential that parents are involved in their children's online experiences. That is why, in compliance with federal law, we do not knowingly collect information of any kind from anyone under the age of 13. If you become aware that a child under 13 has registered as a user of our site, please report the use to: 

_Internet.Inquiries@Banfield.net_

or telephone Banfield's Client Advocate Team at 1‑800-838-6738.  If we become aware of a user under the age of 13 providing information on our site, we will terminate that account and purge our databases of all information provided by that user. 

**_Your California Privacy Rights_**

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits our visitors who are California residents to request certain information regarding its disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes.  To make such a request, please send an email to: [Internet.Inquiries@banfield.net](mailto:Internet.Inquiries@banfield.net) or telephone Banfield’s Client Advocate Team at: 1-800-838-6738.

**_What should you do if you have questions, wish to access, update or delete information, or wish to opt out of receiving future communications?_**
