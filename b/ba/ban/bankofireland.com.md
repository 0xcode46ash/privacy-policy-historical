\- the date and time of visits;  
\- the number of pages viewed;  
\- the amount of time spent on the Website;

This information is anonymous and no attempt is or will be made to identify visitors. So, for example, on a specific day we can identify that our site has forty thousand visitors. However, we know nothing about these visitors in terms of e-mail addresses or any other personal information.

We only ask and will only ask for personal information from which you can be identified where the information is required for particular purposes e.g. applying online for a credit card, mortgage or personal loan. Examples of details that may be sought include your name, address, e-mail address, etc. (Please note in the regard the paragraph headed Internet fraud below)

 **Internet Fraud**

A number of banking organisations and their customers have recently been the target of hoax e-mails that are aimed at gathering Internet/account details of the customers. Some of these hoax e-mails have encouraged or facilitated contact with hoax websites that purport to be (but are not) the website of the relevant banking organisation. To date the occurrence of such online fraud has not been extensive. However, we would always advise you to be cautious as regards disclosing your personal details. In particular, you should note that we will only ever request your personal details if: (i) you are seeking to initiate e-mail contact with us via this Website; or (ii) you initiate a request for a particular service via this Website and we require certain of your personal details to provide you with the requested service and the requested service is a loan/credit card application, a mortgage application, a request for a telephone call from a sales advisor, or a request for a pensions information pack or other product information.
