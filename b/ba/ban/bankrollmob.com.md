# Privacy Policy - BankrollMob

Your privacy is important to BankrollMob.com. We strive to ensure that all your information are kept in strict confidence and will never be sold, rented, reused or otherwise publicized without you explicit consent. In order to identify you with the gaming providers (usually poker sites) and to avoid fraud, some information such as name, e-mail address and your account name/id with that provider, might be shared with the provider, if you request a bonus that needs to be issued to your account. 

During the signup for a "Mob account", we might contact you to verify your personal information. Some of these questions might seem somewhat personal, but is crucial in the prevention of fraud. This information will of course as well be kept strictly confidential. 

You can always ask to have your ID (drivers license / passport) at BankrollMob.com deleted. This will be done as fast as possible. As we have to protect against fraud attempts, we do not delete Mob accounts, but we do one-way data anonymization which means we, or any third party, cannot read your accounts details, while still allowing us to compare new account information with older one-way anonymized account data as a method to prevent fraud by creating multiple accounts. 

During signup you will also be added to our mailinglist and receive information and updates about our offers, site features etc. You can always be removed from our mailinglist by clicking the "unsubscribe"-link in the bottom of each newsletter. 

BankrollMob.com uses Google Analytics with "anonymized IP" address to store and collect data on how our website is used. No personal data is shared with Google Analytics, for GDPR compliance. 

BankrollMob.com reserves the right to change or replace this privacy policy at any time, we therefore ask you to check this page on a regular basis. 

If you should have any questions or comments about our privacy policy please use our [contact form](https://web.archive.org/web/20180523165423id_/http%3A//www.bankrollmob.com/support.asp).
