# BankAtlantic.com - Privacy Statement

BankAtlantic recognizes and respects the expectation of privacy of our customers and other visitors to our web site and we are committed to protecting the privacy rights of our customers and visitors. Our goal is to serve our customers as conveniently as possible, while protecting our customers’ privacy. In order to achieve this goal and to address your concerns about how information you provide us is kept confidential, we have created a privacy policy that addresses a number of Internet-related privacy issues. 

We recognize your right to financial privacy. Any collection, retention or use of information is done so that we may better serve you, and we will not sell or share any information that you provide to us, other than in the limited circumstances described in this policy. 

Information about you may be accumulated from a variety of sources. For example, we may collect nonpublic personal information about you from BankAtlantic applications or other bank forms that you may fill out, your transactional history with us or our affiliates, and consumer reporting agencies. 

Depending upon the service requested, we may ask you for various types of nonpublic personal information. For example, if you wish to apply for a loan, we may ask you for, among other things, your name, address, social security number (for tax and financial purposes), loan amount, monthly income and other pertinent information. 

All of these pieces of information will be referred to collectively throughout this Privacy Policy as "Customer Information." 

We will limit the use and collection of Customer Information to the extent necessary to administer bank business. Such uses may include account initiation, verification of credits and debits, and periodic account maintenance and review. Also, we may use your Customer Information to help us identify and mitigate potential risks or loss to BankAtlantic, which ultimately benefits you. Finally, subject to our "opt out" provisions discussed below, we may use your Customer Information to offer you opportunities that we think will interest you. This also means that we will use the Customer Information to help us identify and mitigate potential risks or loss to BankAtlantic, which ultimately benefits you. 

There are times when we are required to disclose your Customer Information. For example, we must disclose your Customer Information: 

  1. If disclosure is required by court order; or 

  2. If the Bank Secrecy Act, Internal Revenue Code, Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Welfare Reform Act or various other laws and regulations require us to do so. 




We will not reveal your Customer Information or specific account information to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except in connection with the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies (e.g., credit reporters, collection agencies, or similar entities), unless: 

  1. The information must be disclosed to help complete a transaction initiated by you or your legal designee; 

  2. You request that part or all of your Customer Information be disclosed; 

  3. The disclosure is required or allowed by law or governmental regulation; or 

  4. You have been informed of the possibility of such disclosure for marketing or similar purposes and are given an opportunity to decline (i.e., "opt-out"). 




If you elect to opt-out from any marketing or similar arrangement that we may offer, we will not reveal your Customer Information until you tell us otherwise. Similarly, if you previously opted-in to a marketing arrangement and you wish to change your decision, please write to us at BankAtlantic, Opt-out, 1750 E. Sunrise Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304. Please make sure to include your entire name, full address, telephone number, account number(s), and tax identification, or social security number. We will promptly honor your request after we receive your letter. 

There may be certain services, such as credit card services, that are offered to you by reputable companies through our website. If you choose to participate in such services, your browser will be redirected to the company that offers the desired services. You should be aware that these companies may have privacy policies that differ from ours, and you should take the time to read that company's particular privacy policy.

BankAtlantic is part of BankAtlantic Bancorp, Inc. BankAtlantic and our BankAtlantic affiliates may share information about you among affiliates in order to offer products and services of interest to you. If you would rather we not share information from your application, credit bureaus or third parties, please write to us at BankAtlantic, Opt-out, 1750 E. Sunrise Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304. Please make sure to include with your request your entire name, full address, telephone number, account number(s), and tax identification, or social security number.

When you visit our web site, we may use cookies on some pages in order to help us serve you better each time you return. On subsequent visits, we will be able to access such cookies, so that you will not have to re-enter your personal information each time you visit our web site.

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser to alert you of a cookie being offered, or to reject all cookies.
