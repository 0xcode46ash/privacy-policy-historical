# BankAtlantic.com - Privacy Statement

BankAtlantic recognizes and respects the expectation of privacy of our customers and other visitors to our web site and we are committed to protecting the privacy rights of our customers and visitors. Our goal is to serve our customers as conveniently as possible, while protecting our customersâ€™ privacy. In order to achieve this goal and to address your concerns about how information you provide us is kept confidential, we have created a privacy policy that addresses a number of Internet-related privacy issues. 

Certain pages on our web site may require our customers and other visitors to disclose personal and confidential account information. For instance, when you apply for Internet banking privileges with BankAtlantic, we collect personal information in order to process your application. That information is collected and maintained for your protection as we must be able to identify you, and your accounts. We also utilize this information to provide the products and services you request and to offer you new products and services that meet your needs. 

We recognize your right to financial privacy. Any collection, retention or use of information is done primarily for your benefit and we will not sell or share any information that we learn about you from your visit to our web site, other than in the limited circumstances as described in this policy. We will not reveal specific account information about your account(s) or other personally identifiable data to unaffiliated third parties for their independent use, except in connection with the exchange of information with reputable information reporting agencies or in the performance of bona fide corporate due diligence, unless: 

  1. the information is provided to help complete a customer initiated transaction; 
  2. you request such information be disclosed; 
  3. the disclosure is required or allowed by law or governmental regulation; or 
  4. you have been informed about the possibility of such disclosure for marketing or similar purposes through a prior communication and are given the opportunity to decline (i.e., "opt-out"). 



The party to whom we disclose the information will be advised that such information is to be kept confidential. If you do not want us to share any information, please send a separate typed or printed written request via U.S. mail to: 

BankAtlantic   
Attention: **[Branch Operations]**   
P.O. Box 8608

with your name, address, telephone number, account number(s) and tax identification or social security number. We will use all reasonable efforts to honor your request throughout your relationship with us.

Like many leading web sites, our web site uses cookies. A "cookie" is a way for a web site to recognize whether or not you have visited the site before. Cookies do not read other information on your hard drive, nor can they be used to reveal anything about you that you have not chosen to enter as a user on a web site. When you visit our web site, we may use cookies on some pages in order to help us serve you better each time you return. On subsequent visits, we will be able to access such cookies, so that you will not have to re-enter your personal information each time you visit our web site. Using a cookie at such points allows us to recognize you as a customer and to automate your online experience. If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser to alert you of a cookie being offered, or to reject all cookies. 

BankAtlantic associates are aware of our commitment to customer privacy and take this responsibility seriously. We consider serving you a privilege and guarding your privacy one of our primary concerns. We strive to provide confidence in the integrity of the data and transactions we maintain and process on your behalf.

If you have any questions, concerns or comments about our privacy policies or practices, we would like to know what they are so we can address them. Please contact us at 1 (800) 295-6207.
