A. Yes. If you apply online for Bank of the West Bank products, the personal information you provide to us is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

  * Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no information on pages visited by any individual consumer. The aggregate information we collect (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular Web page) is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web page, and is then discarded. 



Here's what we do with information volunteered by the consumer, such as survey information or information requests: 

**E-Mail Address.** If you supply us with your e-mail address online when requesting information about a specific product or service, you will only receive the information that you requested when you provided us your e-mail address.

Here are answers to common questions you may have:  


  
**Our Information About You**

**Q. Inside Bank of the West Bank, how do you control information about my accounts?**  
A. Bank of the West's employees are informed of their responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customer information and are subject to discipline for violating this policy. Only employees actively engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer information are authorized to access that information. 

**Q. Why do you have information about me?**  
A. We collect and use information about individual customers only: 

(1) To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service. 

(2) To help us provide you with additional products or services you might want to know about. Many people have told us they like getting information related to their interests or alerting them to unique products and services. 

(3) To help us protect you and Bank of the West from financial loss. 

In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social Security number or Tax Identification Number for many types of accounts. 

We use information about you only in accordance with the principles set out in this Privacy Policy. 

**Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?**  
A. It's in your interest and ours to have accurate, current and complete information concerning you and your accounts.

We want to correct any inaccuracies right away.

**Credit Report Information About You**

**Q.Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided from outside the bank?**  
A. Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information from reputable credit information reporting agencies. When we do, you are protected both by our own Privacy Policy and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law. 

We will notify you if we decline any application made by you and if we used a consumer credit report during the processing of your application. 

We may also use information from credit reports to prescreen prospects for banking products and services. Federal law requires us to notify you whenever such reports have been used to solicit your business. You may request that credit reporting agencies remove your name from lists supplied to us for transactions you do not initiate. 

**Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?**  
A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as your account balances and your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or other consumer loans. If you don't make payments on time or miss a payment, your credit report may show that, even if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and other "negative" information can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years. 

By law, an individual's credit report can be given to insurance companies, banks and others when needed to transact business with you. There are many uses for credit reports. For instance, those who make loans -- such as Bank of the West -- may refer to the reports to verify the credit-worthiness of borrowers. 

To examine the status of your credit report: 

  * Call or write each of the major credit bureaus and get a copy of your report. 
  * If you spot a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing. 



The bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct any errors. It's a good idea to let each of the major bureaus know if you find a problem in one report. 

For a fee, each of the three national credit bureaus will supply you with a copy of your report. However, if you have been denied credit within the past 60 days because of information in your credit report, you are entitled to a free copy of that report. 

Here is how to contact three of the larger national credit bureaus:

**Q. Does Bank of the West provide credit information to credit reporting agencies?**  
A. Yes. In accordance with standard banking industry practice, we share certain information about our customers with reputable credit reporting agencies, so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. 

On occasion, an entity other than a credit-reporting agency – such as another financial institution or a business -- may ask us for credit information about an individual or business customer. For example, you may be applying for a loan at another bank or establishing a credit relationship with a business. In such instances, we will not provide information about you unless you have given your prior written authorization.

**Use of Information About You Outside Bank of the West**

**Q. Do you give information about customers to the government?**  
A. We _only_ disclose customer information to the government:  
(1) when we are required to do so by laws and regulations,  
(2) when we are served with a subpoena or court or administrative order, or  
(3) when a customer authorizes us to do so. 

**Q. What happens if I'm involved in a lawsuit and bank records are subpoenaed?**  
A. If you are involved in a lawsuit, we will only disclose information about you or your accounts to third-party litigants when we are required to do so during a court proceeding. 

**Q. Do you give information about me to anyone else outside Bank of the West's family of companies?**  
A. Our policy is not to share specific customer information with independent companies for any purpose not connected with financial products and services. 

Like most banks, Bank of the West contracts with outside companies to provide support services such as data processing, check printing, insurance products and statement mailings. These vendors are required to treat such customer information confidentially and use the information only for the specific bank purpose stated. Vendors are prohibited from reusing or selling customer information. 

We also may share account and customer information among the legal entities that comprise the Bank of the West family of companies. These entities may use the information to help identify additional products or services that you might want to know about. 

To collect a customer's unpaid debts, we may also exchange information with financial institutions and other companies, in accordance with standard banking industry practice, to verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. We do not share specific personal customer information with independent companies for any other purpose without the customer's consent. 

**Q. May I request that you not send product information to me or share information about me with companies within the Bank of the West family?**  
A. The law permits us to share within the Bank of the West family of companies and with credit reporting agencies information concerning a customer's account history and experiences with Bank of the West. However, if you wish to be excluded from:   
(1) Offers of products or services by mail, and/or  
(2) Sharing of **other** information about you within the Bank of the West family of companies, please write: 

Bank of the West Bank  
Marketing Department  
1450 Treat Blvd.  
Walnut Creek, CA 94596 

While this may mean you might not receive product information of interest to you, we will respect anyone's request not to receive such information by mail. (Of course, we will continue to send you routine statements and information concerning your existing accounts.) 

* * *

**Protect Yourself From Fraud**

**Q. How can I prevent financial information about me from being used fraudulently?**  
A. Here are some suggestions: 

  * Never give your credit card or bank account number to any unsolicited caller who is unknown to you and seeks to sell you something or offers you a prize. 
  * Memorize your personal identification number (PIN) for ATM transactions and other banking business. Keep it separate from your card. Never use your Social Security number as a password. 
  * Do not put your address, phone number, or other personal information that does not appear on the front of your credit card on a credit card receipt.

**Unwanted Mail Solicitations**

**Q. I get too many mail solicitations from all over the country. Is there anything I can do about it?**  
A. While it's impossible to entirely control who directs mail offers to you, you can take steps to reduce unwanted offers, safeguard your privacy and sit in the information driver's seat. 

The information above explains how to contact Bank of the West to request to be excluded from our mail lists. If you wish to have your name removed from other mailing lists, send a written "do not mail" request with your name, address and Social Security number to: 

Mail Preference Service  
c/o Direct Marketing Association  
P.O. Box 9008
