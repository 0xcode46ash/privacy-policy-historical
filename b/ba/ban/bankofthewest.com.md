# Bank of the West

Bank of the West uses this nonpublic personal information only for business purposes consistent with ethical banking practices and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may share all of the information that we collect. 

**Information Use by the Bank**

The Bank may use your nonpublic personal information as follows:

_Within Bank of the West and Affiliated Companies:_

  * As a security measure, to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing your accounts. 
  * To conduct business safely and soundly. We use customer information, for example, taken from loan applications to manage risk and ensure that we are prudent underwriters. 
  * We may share information about our experience and transactions with you among the Bank's family of companies (BancWest Corporation and its affiliates including First Hawaiian Bank) as permitted by law. We may also share the other types of personal information we collect within the BancWest family of companies. 
  * In satisfying legal requirements, such as for tax reporting as required by state and federal government. 
  * In determining which products and services may best serve your needs. Some of these services, such as mortgage loan servicing, or products, such as credit cards, may be offered through our affiliate, First Hawaiian Bank. 
  * We do not share medical or health information among our family of companies or with other third parties except to process transactions or to provide services you have requested. 



_With Unaffiliated Third Parties:_

Bank of the West does not reveal specific account information or provide other personally identifiable information to unaffiliated companies for their independent use. We may disclose all of the information we collect, as described in "Types of Personal Information Collected" to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.

_As Permitted by Law:_

Banks may legally share customer account information or other personally identifiable information with unaffiliated companies when: 

  * They assist by contract in providing Bank products and services, e.g., check printer and credit insurance. 
  * Information sharing is in the normal course of business, e.g., with credit reporting agencies. 
  * The law requires Bank cooperation, e.g., fraud investigation, subpoena, or a request by an authorized government regulator. 
  * "Due diligence" is performed during a merger, acquisition or sale of a loan/lease portfolio. 
  * A customer has earlier been informed of the possible disclosure of information for marketing or similar purposes and given an opportunity to decline ("opt-out"). 



**Customer Privacy in Third Party Relationships**

When we provide customer information to a third party, as permitted by law, we insist - through a written agreement - that the third party maintain the confidentiality of your personally identifiable customer information.

**Marketing of Bank of the West's Products and Services**

From time to time, the Bank may promote its products and services directly to customers. If you do not want to receive these offers, you may ask the Bank not to include you by following the "opt-out" procedures below.

**Ways to Limit the Bank's Use or Disclosure of Your Personal Information**

We at Bank of the West have developed this policy brochure because we want you to understand and trust our commitment to confidentiality and to further understand how we use personally identifiable information. If you have questions about the privacy of your information, please call 1 (800) 488-BANK (2265). If you are calling from the Santa Clara Valley of California, please call (408) 947-5030.

We will provide one privacy policy disclosure and opt-out form in the event of joint account relationships. One party may opt-out on behalf of all joint account holders. Once your request for an "opt-out" has been processed, it will remain in effect for the life of the account.

**Opt-Out Procedures**

  * Provide nonpublic information about you to unaffiliated companies offering products and/or services, 
  * Share information from your applications or outside sources among our family of companies, or

 **Frequently Asked Questions**

**How Bank of the West Protects your Privacy**

At Bank of the West, trust is the basis of each customer relationship. We recognize your right to privacy. Our employees treat information concerning your accounts in the same responsible, confidential way we want our own financial affairs treated.

 **Q. Is my privacy protected if I visit Bank of the West's Website (www.bankofthewest.com) on the Internet?**  
A. Yes. If you apply online for Bank of the West products, the personal information you provide to us is encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology.

Also, if you visit our Web page, our Web server automatically recognizes only: 

  * Your Internet Service Provider, but not your specific e-mail address. For instance, if your e-mail address is "johndoe@aol.com," only the aol.com part of the address is recognized. 
  * Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no specific information on the individual consumer. The aggregate information we collect (for instance, how many "hits" on a particular Web page) is used for internal review to improve the content of our Web page, and is then destroyed. 

**Q. What do you do with information that I volunteer, such as survey information or information requests?**  
A. When you request information about a specific product or service, we will use the e-mail address, the postal address or the telephone number only to deliver the requested information.

If you enroll in our eTimeBanker service and supply us with personal data (such as e-mail address, birth date, income range or home ownership information), we may use this data to provide you with personalized information on products, services or special promotions we feel will be of interest to you. However, if you wish to be excluded from receiving such information by e-mail, we'll give you an opportunity to tell us this online. We will respect your wishes not to receive such e-mail. 

**Q. How can I insure that you will not share information about me in the future?**  
A. If you do not want us to share your nonpublic personal information, if we choose to participate in any programs in the future, simply complete the "opt-out" form portion of your disclosure, tear it off, place a stamp on it, and place it in the mail.

**Q. If I've already signed an "opt-out" form, do I have to sign another one?**  
A. No. Your opt-out direction remains in place as long as your account is open.

**Q. I have opened a new account with Bank of the West since I signed the "opt-out" form. Do I need to complete a new form to cover my new product or service?**  
A. We attempt to apply your opt-out direction to all of your accounts at Bank of the West, to all joint account holders on those accounts, and to any new accounts you open, whenever possible. However, if the account on which you originally opted out has been closed, or if your name or address or other parties on your new account have changed, it may not be possible to match your old account and opt-out direction to your new account. We recommend that you complete a new opt-out form.

**Q. Does this mean you will stop sending me junk mail?**  
A. If you have chosen to opt-out, we will attempt to exclude you and other account holders in your household from our internal mailing and phone solicitation lists, whenever possible. However, it is not possible to exclude any account holders from receiving "statement stuffers" and similar types of materials. You should also be aware that Bank of the West is required to send you certain important types of information, such as change in terms notices, which might appear to be "junk mail" but actually isn't.

**Q. I received several copies of your privacy policy disclosure. Why?**  
A. If all of your accounts at Bank of the West are "linked" (i.e., all your accounts appear on one statement), you should receive only one copy of our privacy policy. However, if you have multiple accounts or receive multiple statements, you may receive a copy of our privacy policy in connection with each account.

In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social Security number or Tax Identification Number for many types of accounts.

**Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?**  
A. It's in your interest and ours to have accurate, current and complete information concerning you and your accounts. If you believe that we have erroneous information, please contact your Bank of the West Branch or call (800) 488-2265 or if in the San Jose Area call (408) 947-5030. We want to correct any inaccuracies right away. 

**Q. What happens if I'm involved in a lawsuit and bank records are subpoenaed?**  
A. If you are involved in a lawsuit, we will only disclose information about you or your accounts to third party litigants when we are required to do so during a court proceeding.

**Q. Do you give information about me to anyone else outside Bank of the West's family of companies?**  
A. Like most banks, Bank of the West contracts with outside companies to provide support services such as data processing, check printing, insurance products and statement mailings. These vendors are required to treat such customer information confidentially and use the information only for the specific bank purpose stated. Vendors are prohibited from reusing or selling customer information.

We also may share certain account and customer information among the legal entities that comprise the Bank of the West family of companies. These entities may use the information to help identify additional products or services that you might want to know about. 

To collect a customer's unpaid debts, we may also exchange information with financial institutions and other companies, in accordance with standard banking industry practice, to verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts. 

We do not share nonpublic personal customer information with independent companies for any other purpose without the customer's consent.

**Q. Do you sell my information to telemarketing companies?**  
A. We do not employ telemarketing companies to sell Bank of the West products and services, nor do we sell or give customer information to telemarketing companies to use to solicit business from you.

**Q. May I request that you not send product information to me or share information about me with companies within the Bank of the West family?**  
A. This law permits us to share within the Bank of the West family of companies and with credit reporting agencies information concerning a customer's account history and experiences with Bank of the West. However, if you wish to be excluded from:

  1. Offers of products or services by mail, and/or  

  2. Sharing of other information about you within the Bank of the West family of companies; 



You should complete and return the opt-out form. 

While this may mean you might not receive product information of interest to you, we will respect your request not to receive such information by mail. (Of course, we will continue to send you routine statements and information concerning your existing accounts.)
