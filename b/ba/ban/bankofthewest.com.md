We recognize the importance you place on your privacy and the confidentiality of your financial information. We think it's important for you - as our customer - to be informed of the policies we have in place to safeguard your privacy:

a. We do all that we can to make sure that information we have about customers is accurate, and is accessible only by those employees actively engaged in dealing with you or your accounts.

c. We educate our employees about their responsibility to protect your privacy.

Here are answers to common questions you may have:

**Our Information About You**

**Q. Inside Bank of the West, how do you control information about my accounts?**

A. Our employees are informed of their responsibility to protect the confidentiality of customer information and are subject to discipline for violating this policy. Only employees actively engaged in the discharge of assigned duties involving customer information are authorized to access that information.

**Q. Why do you have information about me?**

A. We collect and use information about individual customers only:

a. To open and administer your accounts and provide superior service.

b. To help us provide you with additional products or services you might want to know about. Many people have told us they like getting information related to their interests or alerting them to unique products and services.

c. To help us protect you and us from financial loss.

In some cases, laws governing financial institutions require us to gather information. For example, federal regulations require that we obtain a Social Security number or Tax Identification Number for many types of accounts.

We use information about you only in accordance with the principles set out in this Privacy Policy.

**Q. What can I do if I discover that information Bank of the West has is inaccurate?**

A. It's in your interest and ours for us to have accurate, current and complete information concerning you and your accounts. If you believe that we have erroneous information, please let us know by contacting:

    * Your Bank of the West branch or by calling **_1-800-488-2265, in the 408 area code call, 408-947-5030_**



We want to correct any inaccuracies right away.

**Credit Report Information About You**

Q. Do you use information from consumer credit reports provided from outside the bank?

A. Yes. It's standard banking industry practice to obtain information from reputable credit information reporting agencies. When we do so, you are protected both by our own internal Privacy Policy and by the Fair Credit Reporting Act, a federal law.

We will notify you if we decline any application made by you and if we used a consumer credit report during the processing of your application.

We may also use credit reports for the purpose of prescreening prospects for banking products and services. Federal law requires us to notify you whenever such reports have been used to solicit your business. You may request that credit reporting agencies remove your name--- from lists supplied to us for transactions you do not initiate.

**Q. Does Bank of the West provide credit information to these credit-reporting agencies?**

A. Consistent with the practice of financial institutions and other businesses, Bank of the West shares certain information about our customers with reputable credit reporting agencies, so creditors can verify the existence and condition of customers' accounts.

**Q. What exactly is on these credit reports?**

A. Your credit report includes personal and financial information such as your payment history for credit cards, mortgages or loans, and credit card account balances. If you don't make your payments on time or miss a payment, your credit report will show that, even if you catch up on your payments later. Late payments and other "negative" information can remain on your credit report for up to 7 years; bankruptcies, for up to 10 years.

By law, an individual's credit report can be given to insurance companies, banks and others when needed to transact business with you. There are many uses for credit reports. For instance, those who make loans - such as Bank of the West - may refer to the reports to verify the credit-worthiness of borrowers.

To examine the status of your credit report:

a. Call or write each of the major credit bureaus and get a copy of your report.

b. If you spot a problem, promptly inform the credit bureau in writing.

The bureau must investigate the disputed entry and correct it if it is erroneous. It's a good idea to let each of the major bureaus know if you find a problem in one report.

For a fee, each of the three national credit bureaus will supply you with a copy of your report. However, if you have been denied credit within the past 60 days because of information in your credit report, you are entitled to a free copy of that report.

A. Our policy is not to share specific personal customer information with independent companies for any purpose not connected with financial products and services.

Specific customer information may be shared with vendors we hire to provide operational support, such as computer processing. In addition, we may share information with companies that participate with us in supplying high-quality financial products and services to customers.

While this may mean you might not receive product information of interest to you, we will respect anyone's request not to receive product information by mail. (Of course, we will continue to send you routine statements and information concerning your existing accounts. Also, as described above, we will continue to share information about our experience with you with credit reporting agencies, other financial institutions and members of the Bank of the West family of companies.)

**Protecting Yourself From Fraud**

**Q. How can I prevent financial information about me from being used fraudulently?**

A. Here are some suggestions:

Never give your credit card or bank account number to any unsolicited caller who is unknown to you and seeks to sell you something or offers you a prize.

Check out unfamiliar companies by calling your state consumer protection office and the local chapter of the Better Business Bureau. You can also report suspicious telemarketing calls to the National Fraud Information Center Hotline at (800) 876-7060. The hotline is run by a nonprofit organization concerned about telemarketing fraud.

Memorize your personal identification number (PIN) for ATM transactions and other banking business. Keep it separate from your card. Never use your Social Security number or PIN number as a password.

Do not put your address, phone number, or other personal information that does not appear on the front of your credit card on a credit card receipt.

**Internet Privacy**

**Q. Is my privacy protected if I visit Bank of the West's Website (www.bankofthewest.com) on the Internet?**

A. Yes. As a visitor to our Web site, you need not be concerned about the privacy of your personal information. We do not gather information on individual users on our Web site. For each visitor to Bank of the West's Website, our Web server automatically recognizes only:

a. The consumer's Internet Service Provider (for example, America Online or att.net), but not your specific e-mail address. For instance, if your e-mail address is "johndoe@provider.net, only the provider.net part of the address is recognized.

b. Aggregate information on which pages consumers visit, but no information on pages visited by any individual consumer. The aggregate information we collect (for instance, number of "hits" on a particular Web page) is used for internal review purposes only, to improve the content of our Web page, and is then discarded. This information simply enables us to tell which areas of the site are of most interest to our users and when peak usage times are.

On this Website [www.bankofthewest.com](http://www.bankofthewest.com/), we do not collect information concerning your postal mail address or your telephone number, unless you ask us to, mail information or contact you.

**Mail Solicitations**

**Q. I get too many mail solicitations from all over the country. Is there anything I can do about it?**

A. Although many people appreciate the offers they receive, some consumers clearly feel that they get too many. While it's impossible to entirely control who directs mail offers to you, you can take steps to reduce unwanted offers, safeguard your privacy, and sit in the information driver's seat.

The information above explains how to contact Bank of the West to request to be excluded from our mail lists. If you wish to have your name removed from other mailing lists, send a written "do not mail" request with your name, address and Social Security number to:
