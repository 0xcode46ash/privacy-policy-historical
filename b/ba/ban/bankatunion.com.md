## Privacy of Consumer Financial Information

We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications for loans or other forms;
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others; and
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (credit bureau).



To better serve your financial needs, we may disclose the following kinds of nonpublic personal information about you (as a current or former customer) to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements and affiliated third parties such as our mortgage companies, Union Mortgage Group, Inc., and Johnson Mortgage Company, LLC; our securities investment company, Union Investment Services, Inc.; and our insurance company, Union Insurance Group, LLC; and our member bank, Union First Market Bank:

  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number, assets and income(s);
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and credit card usage; and
  * Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency (credit bureau) such as your creditworthiness and credit history.



To improve our service delivery, we may disclose nonpublic personal information, as described above, about you to certain third parties, including financial service providers (e.g., payment-processing companies), non-financial companies (e.g., software developers), and others (e.g., consulting firms). These third party companies have agreed to treat any such information as confidential and not share it with any other parties except as permitted by law. We may also disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties as permitted by law.

We restrict access to this nonpublic personal information about you to only those employees who need to know that information in order to provide products or services to you. In addition, we maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in compliance with federal regulations to guard your nonpublic personal information.

If you prefer that we not disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated and/or affiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law). It is important to note that information about specific transactions and experience with a customer will still be shared with affiliated third parties and others as permitted by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. If you wish to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated and/or affiliated third parties, as defined above, you may contact us toll free at 800-990-4828.
