We collect information, such as name, e-mail and postal addresses, phone and credit card numbers from you when you visit our website or one of our stores, place an order online or by phone, make an in-store purchase, save your info with us online, or participate in a contest, promotion or survey. We maintain a record of your product interests and the purchases you make online or by phone and in our stores, and may also acquire information about you from our joint marketing partners, from unrelated third parties, and from our affiliates, including, without limitation, Gap and Old Navy.

When you place an order or make a purchase from BananaRepublic.com, we use your personal information to process your order, send you e-mails to confirm your order or to contact you via phone, postal mail or e-mail if we have other questions regarding your order or purchase.

When you place an order, make a purchase or save your information online, we will use your e-mail and postal address to send you information about our products, services, contests, and promotions and to help us learn more about your shopping preferences. If you participate in a contest or promotion (online, over the phone or at one of our retail stores), we may use your personal information to send you e-mails, postal mail, or telephone (including text messages) regarding our products, services, contests and promotions. From time to time, we may use this information to contact you via e-mail, postal mail, or telephone to learn more about your shopping preferences. You always have the choice not to receive marketing information or calls. 

In addition, we may use information about you and your product interests and purchases from us and our affiliates, including without limitation, Gap and Old Navy, to help us improve our site design and your online and in-store shopping experiences. We may contact you, subject to the choices you have made, via e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, to conduct market research and learn more about how we can improve our product offerings. 

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us and information about your product interest and purchases with information from third parties, including demographic information and information that is publicly available. We may also combine this information with information from our affiliates, including without limitation, Gap and Old Navy. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your shopping experience with us, and to communicate with you in accordance with this policy. 

If you shop at one of our affiliates (including, without limitation, Gap and Old Navy), we share information about you with that affiliate, so that it can communicate with you by e-mail or postal mail about their products, services, contests and promotions that may be of interest to you. Each of our affiliates has a privacy policy that is consistent with our own.

We also contract with service providers to maintain and manage our customer information, to fulfill promotions and to communicate with our customers. We do not authorize any of these service providers to make any other use of your information. 

In addition, when we team up with another company to offer or provide products, services, contests or promotions, we may compare our customer list with theirs to identify our common customers. Both Banana Republic and our marketing partners may use that information to fulfill our respective obligations to you and for future promotional activities.

When we offer contests and promotions, with or without a marketing partner, you may be required to provide certain personal information in order to participate. In these cases, we will give you the choice not to receive e-mail messages or other communications from us regarding our products, services, contests, and promotions. In this case, however, Banana Republic may still need to contact you, for example, to notify winners and to fulfill promotional obligations.

Scrip programs allow you to instruct Banana Republic to divert a percentage of the amount you spend to participating schools and other non-profit organizations. Loyalty programs allow you to earn "points" on purchases at Banana Republic, which you may then use toward certain rewards offered by the loyalty programs in which you participate. If you choose to participate in any scrip, loyalty, or other similar program in which Banana Republic is a participating vendor, the company administering the scrip, loyalty, or other similar program (collectively, the "scrip company") should provide a link on its website that permits you to authorize Banana Republic or our credit card processor(s) to provide information about your Banana Republic purchases. The information you authorize us to disclose to the scrip company will include your credit card number and the date and amount of your purchase, and may also include your name and other information you have asked us to provide. Please note that once Banana Republic discloses this information, the scrip company may use and share it with others in accordance with its own privacy policy. You should review these policies carefully, as we have no control over them.

In the unlikely event of a sale of some or all of our business, Banana Republic will disclose your personal information to a purchaser that agrees to abide by the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. 

Banana Republic reserves the right to disclose information about you as required by law, in response to legal process and law enforcement requests, and as necessary to protect the property, interests and rights of Banana Republic, its affiliates, and others.

A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. A cookie may contain information, such as a unique user ID that websites use to track the pages of the sites you've visited.

Protecting your order information is important to us. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.

Some versions of browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers like the ones we use to process orders at BananaRepublic.com. To check the security of your connection, look at the lower left-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

If your browser or firewall doesn't support SSL, you will not be able to connect to the server, which means you won't be able to mistakenly place an order through an unsecured connection. If you cannot access the secure server for any reason, please print our order form and place your order by phone at 1.888.277.8953 or by fax at 1.888.906.2465.
