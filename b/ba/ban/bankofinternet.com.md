**Do I have an option to regularly receive these records in nonelectronic form?**

No, not really. If you want to use our Online Banking Service, the Service was designed and built to provide records to you in electronic form. Put another way, the system is an electronic banking system and it does not have a paper-based alternative.

**Can I get a copy of the records in nonelectronic form if a special need arises?**

Yes, you can. If you request one, we can prepare a paper-based version of any of the electronic records you receive, for up to five years after the date it was created. If you want us to prepare a paper-based copy, you can request it by contacting us using one of the Contacts shown above.

If you request one, we will provide a paper-based copy of an electronic record free of any Bank charges, with one exception. There is a charge of $ 2.00 per page for paper- based copies of your monthly statements, and we will charge this fee to your account. Normally, we will mail paper-based copies of an electronic record to you (at the address shown on our records) within 3 weeks after the date we receive your Contact request for it. 

**If I consent to electronic records now, and change my mind, what can I do and what are the consequences?**

You can change your mind, and withdraw your consent, at any time. We will then stop providing records to you electronically. To withdraw your consent, all you need to do is contact us using one of the Contacts described above.

However, remember that the Online Banking Service does not support paper-based communications. So the consequence to you, if you withdraw your consent to electronic records, is that your access to and your ability to use the Online Banking Service will end.

**Are there any hardware or software requirements for me to access or retain the electronic records?**

Yes, there are. You will need a computer with sufficient memory to store electronic records, and with a working connection to the Internet. You will need a minimum web-browser version of Internet Explorer 5.0 or Netscape Navigator 5.1 (or higher), with e-mail capability. Your browser will need to have 128-bit encryption capabilities. You are responsible for configuring your system to accommodate these requirements. Finally, you will need a printer if you want to print copies of electronic records.

If we change the minimum hardware or software requirements needed to access or retain electronic records, and the change creates a material risk that you will not be able to access or retain a subsequent record, then before the change takes effect we will let you know about the change and let you know what the new requirements are.

We will notify you by e-mail, and at that time you will be allowed to choose whether you still want to give us your consent to receiving communications or information by electronic records. If not, you will be allowed to withdraw your consent at that time, without any fee or charge by us.

However, if you withdraw your consent, you may not be able to access the Online Banking Services without upgraded hardware or software. Then, your ability to use the Online Banking Service could also end (as described above, under “If I consent to electronic records now, and change my mind, what can I do and what are the consequences?”).

**How will the electronic records be provided to me?**

Your “Deposit Account Agreement and Disclosure” and the “Privacy notices and disclosures” are available online and in the disclosure book. 

Other “periodic or special notices” will be sent to you by e-mail, unless they contain confidential account information. If so, then these will be posted at our web site, or mailed if posted to our web site we will send an e-mail to you letting you know that they can be picked up.
