Any data captured is in compliance with third party privacy requirements. Captured data is aggregate and can include, but is not limited to, location, population segmentation, gender and use of site.

BofI does not facilitate the merging of PII with non-personally identifiable information, without prior proper notice to the user and an opt-in consent process. 

BofI and its affiliates may also use cookies and other online tracking devices such as pixel tags and clear GIFs (also known as web beacons) to collect Online/Mobile Activity Data from you depending on your browser settings.
