Bandai America's Children's Online Privacy Policy  
  


We here at Bandai America Incorporated (BAI) make the safety and privacy of children a top concern. As a result, we want to make sure you know just what information we collect from children under 13 and what we do with that information. This notice is being supplied in compliance with the [Children's Online Privacy Protection Act](http://www.coppa.org/) (COPPA). Bandai attempts to adhere/or intends to comply with CARU's Self-Regulatory Guidelines for Children's Advertising.

All the information collected at the BAI website is used only by Bandai. You can contact BAI at:

While visiting the BAI website we may request and store personally identifiable information. Such information may include name, nickname, birth date, contact information (including address, phone number, and email address), gender, product interests, hobbies, and parental contact information. Any time this information is requested, the child has to specifically enter and submit the information. None of this information is ever collected automatically and this policy will be easily accessible from each page that collects information. Additionally, we are careful to inform children that parental consent is required for this type of participation.

Additional information such as the web pages visited, links followed, and amount of time spent viewing content on the BAI website may be collected automatically and stored in a personally identifiable fashion, provided the child is a registered user of the BAI website.

Other information may be automatically recorded by our web server to provide usage statistics and information so that we can provide a better experience at the BAI website. This information is not personally identifiable.

The BAI website may make use of cookies (small pieces of information placed on your computer by our website) for information collection purposes. The information provided by these cookies will be personally identifiable only in some circumstances and then only if the child is a registered user of the BAI website.

All the information we collect may, at times, be used for the following:

| -  | Notification of contest winners and qualifiers  
---|---|---  
-  | Promotional, marketing, and informative mailings related to Bandai products  
-  | Order or request fulfillment  
-  | To provide a unique identifier and establish eligibility for online message forums  
-  | BAI website tracking  
-  | Marketing research  
-  | Internal Bandai research  
  
All information collected will be used solely by Bandai and not given, sold, or otherwise transferred to third parties in a personally identifiable form.

And, of course, we here at Bandai want to make sure everyone has fun, so we will not require children to surrender any information as a requirement to participate in any section of the website unless that information is essential to the function of that section.

If a child sends an unsolicited request for information or services, the information provided will be used solely for response to that specific request. Although the original request may be retained for a short time to better facilitate the fulfillment of the request, none of the information will be used outside the scope of the original request made by the child.

At any time, a parent may request to view the personal information collected by BAI related to that parent's child and may request a deletion and halt to further information collection related to the child. To initiate such a request, email [webmaster@bandai.com](mailto:webmaster@bandai.com) stating the full name the child used to register at the BAI website.

If you have any questions or comments on this policy, please feel free to email [webmaster@bandai.com](mailto:webmaster@bandai.com).

BAI reserves the right to modify this policy. If significant changes to the type of information collected or use of collected information occur, this policy will be emailed to the parents of registered users under 13 years of age.
