This Privacy Policy for www.bandt.com.au, a marketing and media product of Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc., applies solely to this particular Web site. Other Reed Business Information affiliated Web sites may have different privacy policies and/or practices. 

This Policy guides how we collect, store and use information about customers and prospects, and will be continuously assessed against new technologies, business practices and our customers' changing needs.

Our Use of Cookies

Our Web site uses ad servers to serve the advertisements that you see on pages of our Web site. Our web site along with thousands of other web sites uses cookies to enhance your web viewing experience. 

Cookies are not programs that come onto a user's system and damage files. A cookie is a small text file that includes a unique number. The Ad Server records that records that number in the cookie file of your computer, and allows us to remember your browser on a repeat visit. The cookie helps the Ad Server to serve ads to you that are better tailored to your needs and interests.

Our Use of Registration Information

Many of our publications are available free of charge or may be subscribed to at reduced rates because they are supported by advertisers. Qualification and registration questionnaires and other processes ensure that our advertisers reach the appropriate audiences. We may use the information we collect from you individually or aggregated with other users' information to improve our publications, to customize these publications, and to notify you about updates, new features and subscription information. 

From time to time, companies and organisations approach us that have a product or service that we believe may be of interest to you. We may share the information with these companies in an effort to help you find these resources. In doing this we always maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of your information.

We offer you the opportunity to "opt out" of having your individually identifiable information shared with third-parties that are not affiliated with Reed Business Information (except for uses specifically requested by you, and legitimate business uses). 

You can simply click on the 'opt out' tick bosses that appear when registration forms are completed on this website. Or you can submit in writing third-party opt-out requests to our Customer Service Manager in one of the following ways: (please be sure to include your name, company and contact number in case we need to clarify your details).
