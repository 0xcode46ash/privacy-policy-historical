What this policy covers  
This privacy policy covers Bankrate Inc.'s treatment of personally identifiable information that Bankrate collects when you are on our site and when you use Bankrate services. This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Bankrate does not own or control, or to people that Bankrate does not employ or manage.  
  
Information collection and use  
Bankrate collects personally identifiable information when you register for one of our newsletters and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes.

Information sharing and disclosure  
Bankrate will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. Bankrate will send personally identifiable information about you to other companies or people when: 

  * We have your consent to share the information.
  * We need to share your information to provide the product or service you have requested.
  * We need to send the information to companies who work on behalf of Bankrate to provide a product or service to you. Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders or legal process.
  * We find that your actions on our Web sites violate the Bankrate Inc. terms of service, or any of our usage guidelines for specific products or services.
