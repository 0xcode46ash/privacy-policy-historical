**The Opportunities you Deserve, The Privacy you Expect  
**

Banner Corporation and its affiliates, Banner Bank, Community Financial Corporation, and Northwest Financial Corporation, respects and values your personal privacy and your personal information. Our goal is to serve you and meet your financial needs in the most effective and convenient way possible and to ensure that information you share with us or we gather about you remains confidential.  


To offer you the opportunities you deserve as a Banner Corporation customer, we find that sharing limited amounts of your personal information within our Banner Corporation family of companies and with well-respected, carefully selected business partners enables us to offer you personalized products and services at lower costs and/or with greater convenience than would otherwise be possible.  


Banner Corporation does not sell customer information to any third-party marketer.  
  
**Information We Gather and Disclose  
**

In order to provide financial products and services to you, protect your account from fraud, and comply with government regulations, we collect and maintain a range of customer data including nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:  


  * Information we receive from you on applications or other forms, such as your name, address, phone number, Social Security Number, assets, income, and debts. 
  * Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates or others, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions, and overdraft history. 
  * Information we receive from consumer reporting agencies, such as your creditworthiness or credit history.
  * Information we receive from outside sources regarding their relationships with you or verifying representations made by you, such as banking history, loan or deposit balances, employment history, or property insurance coverage.



We disclose nonpublic personal information to third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, federal and state regulators, and loan investors, in order to do business with you or as required by law.  


We may also share nonpublic personal information with companies that perform services on our behalf, such as vendors who prepare monthly statements, process checks and provide support of one or more of our products or services. These business partners contractually agree to keep your information confidential and not to use it for any other purpose.  


We may share with our affiliates only information about your transactions with us, such as your account balance, payment history, parties to transactions and overdraft history, except as permitted by law.  


We occasionally receive limited medical information if a customer applies for credit insurance. We do not share medical information except to process transactions or service customer requests.  
  
**Benefits of Sharing With Financial Service Providers and Joint Marketing Partners  
**

To make products or services that we believe may meet your financial needs available to you, we may share all of the information we collect as described in "Information We Gather and Disclose" to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to other financial institutions with whom we have joint marketing agreements.  
  
**Our Security Procedures  
**

We take prudent steps to safeguard customer information. We restrict access to nonpublic personal information about you to those employees who need to know that information to provide products or services to you. We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that comply with federal and state standards to guard your nonpublic personal information.
