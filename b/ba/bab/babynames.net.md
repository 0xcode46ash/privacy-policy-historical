## 4\. Cookies and Online Advertising:

#### Cookies:

We use cookies, pixel tags, web beacons and other such similar technologies to collect and store the information we automatically collect about your computer, device and Service usage. A cookie is a small file that is stored on your device and a pixel tag (also called a web beacon or clear GIF) is a tiny graphic with a unique identifier, embedded invisibly on a webpage (or an online ad or email). We use the term "cookies" in this policy to refer to cookies and all such similar technologies.

There are two broad categories of cookies: (1) first party cookies, served directly by us to your device, and (2) third party cookies, which are served by a third party on our behalf.  Cookies have a lot of jobs.  For example, our cookies enable us to recognize you (e.g. as a registered user) when you visit our website and to store your preferences and settings.  We use third party cookies for functionality, performance / analytics, advertising and social media purposes.  Cookies from advertising companies, for example, help to ensure that the advertisements you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.  To understand more about certain types of cookies and pixel tags, click [here](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/).

#### How To Control Or Delete Cookies:

Most browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. Users can usually set their browsers to block certain third-party cookies (which are those set by third-party companies collecting information on websites operated by other companies), block certain cookies (including certain first-party cookies such as the ones we use to collect search activity information about its users), or block specific cookies.  These settings will typically be found in the "options" or "preferences" menu of your browser. In order to understand these settings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the "Help" option in your browser for more details.

  * [Cookie settings in Internet Explorer](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/196955)
  * [Cookie settings in Firefox](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Cookies)
  * [Cookie settings in Chrome](http://www.google.com/support/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95647)
  * [Cookie settings in Safari web](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH5042) and [iOS](http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1677)



Please note that if you choose to block cookies, this may interfere with certain functionality on our website.  Also, if you have disabled one or more cookies, we may still use information collected from cookies prior to your disabled preference being set; however, we will stop using the disabled cookie to collect any further information.

Third parties whose products or services are accessible or advertised through the Services, including social networking services, may also use cookies or similar tools, and we advise you to check their privacy policies for information about their cookies and other practices.  We do not control the practices of such partners and their privacy policies govern their interactions with you.  We encourage you to read their privacy policies.

#### Online Behavioral Advertising and Mobile:

Advertisers and advertising service providers place ads (including sponsored links in search results) on our Site and in our mobile applications. These companies, as well as data analytics companies who service them, may use cookies, pixel tags, mobile device IDs and other similar technologies to collect data about you.  They use the data to enable them to track your activity across various sites and applications where they display ads or record your activities, so they can show ads that they or their partners consider relevant to you.  You may opt-out of receiving targeted online advertising from certain advertising service providers that is delivered on our Site and other websites by visiting the following websites:

  * Network Advertising Initiative (<http://www.networkadvertising.org/>) 
  * Digital Advertising Alliance (<http://www.aboutads.info/consumers>) 



Please bear in mind that there are many more companies listed on these sites than those that drop cookies on our Site.

If you are using an IACSAM mobile application, we use your unique mobile device ID number to recognize you when you use the application and to store your preferences and settings. Advertising companies may also use and store your mobile device ID to show ads that they consider relevant to you in various mobile services that you use.

If you are using an iOS device and you do not want to receive tailored in-application ads that relate to your interests, you may opt-out by accessing the following link on your device: [http://oo.apple.com](http://oo.apple.com/). If you are using an iOS6 device, you also may limit the delivery of tailored in-application ads by: Open Settings and tap "General" then tap "About"; Scroll to the bottom of About and tap "Advertising"; Flip "Limit Ad Tracking" to ON.  For iOS7 and above, you can find the "Limit Ad Tracking" option by tapping "Settings", "Privacy" and then "Advertising". If you are using an Android device and you do not wish to receive tailored in-application ads, you can open the Google Settings app on your device, select "Ads" and follow the instructions.  We do not control how the applicable platform operator allows you to control receiving tailored in-application ads; thus, you should contact the platform provider if the above options are no longer available.

#### Mobile Device Location Information:

When you use one of our location-enabled services (for example, when you access Services from a mobile device), we may need to collect and process information about your actual GPS location (including the latitude, longitude or altitude of your mobile device) and the time the location information was recorded.  Some of these services require your personal data for the feature to work and we may associate location data with your device ID and other information we hold about you.  If you do not want your location information collected when you use the Services from a mobile device, please follow these instructions:

  * If you are using an Apple device, open Settings and then click on "General," then "Reset," then "Reset Location and Privacy." This will turn off location functionality for all of your apps so that the next time you download or use an app, you will be asked again to provide your consent for us and others to access your location information. App-specific location settings may be available by opening Settings and clicking on "Privacy" and then "Location". 
  * If you are using an Android device, visit device settings, click “Location,” and then click the boxes for the particular applications for which you would like to disable location services. 
  * If your device changes the above methods of disabling the collection of mobile device location, please contact your device manufacturer or platform provider to determine how to disable the collection of this information. 



## 5\. Reviewing, changing or deleting information

If you would like to review or request a change to or deletion of personal information we have collected from you, please contact the IACSAM Privacy Officer:

IAC Search & Media, Inc.   
Attn: Privacy Officer   
555 12th Street, 11th Floor   
Oakland, CA 94607 

**Do Not Track.** Do Not Track (“DNT”) is a privacy preference that users can set in certain web browsers. DNT is a way for users to inform websites and services that they do not want certain information about their webpage visits collected over time and across websites or online services. We are committed to providing you with meaningful choices about the information collected on our website for third party purposes, and that is why we provide the Network Advertising Initiative and the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out links above. However, we do not recognize or respond to browser-initiated DNT signals, as the Internet industry is currently still working toward defining exactly what DNT means, what it means to comply with DNT, and a common approach to responding to DNT. Third parties may collect personally identifiable information about an individual consumer's online activities over time and across different Web sites when a consumer uses our Site; we do not control whether or how they respond to DNT signals. 

## 6\. How do we keep the information we collect secure?

We take the security of your personal information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  We also limit access to personal information about you to employees who reasonably need access to it to provide products or services to you, or in order to do their jobs.  However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.

## 7\. How long do we keep the information we collect?

We retain the information we collect about and from you for as long as necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.  We may also choose to anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time.

## 8\. Children under 13

The Services are not intended for users under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.  If we become aware that a person submitting information is under 13, we will attempt to delete the information as soon as possible.  You hereby represent that you are at least 13.

## 9\. Your California Privacy Rights

If you are a resident of California, in addition to the rights set forth above, you have the right to send us a request at the designated address to receive the following information, with certain exceptions:

  * the categories of personal information we disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the preceding calendar year; 
  * the names and addresses of the third parties that received that information’ and 
  * if the nature of any such third party’s business cannot be determined from their name, examples of the products or services marketed.

If you are visiting the Services from outside the United States, your data will be transferred to and stored in servers in the U.S. or other countries that have privacy laws that may differ significantly from those of your location.
