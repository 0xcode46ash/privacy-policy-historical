# BabyTV - Privacy Policy

Effective July, 2014

**1.    INTRODUCTION**

Baby Network Limited (“BabyTV” or “we”) wants you to be familiar with how we collect, use and disclose information from and about you. This Privacy Policy describes our practices in connection with information collected through services such as websites, mobile sites, applications (“apps”) and widgets (collectively, the “BabyTV Services”).  By using BabyTV Services, you agree to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and consent to our use of your personal information in the manner set out below.  A list of our affiliated companies (“BabyTV Affiliates”) is available at [www.21cf.com](http://www.21cf.com/#&panel1-1). 

This Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy (<http://www.babytv.com/informationaboutcookies.aspx>) applies to all users, including both those who use the BabyTV Services without being registered with or subscribing to a BabyTV Service and those who have registered with or subscribed to a BabyTV Service.  This Policy applies to BabyTV’s collection and use of your personal information. It also describes generally BabyTV’s practices for handling non-personal information. 

Other than Activity Information described below, which is used to support the internal operations of the BabyTV Services, we do not collect information from children.  Accordingly, children are not eligible to use some features of the BabyTV Services. 

**2.     COLLECTION OF INFORMATION **

BabyTV and our service providers may collect the following information from and about you:  

Registration Information is the information eligible users submit to register for a BabyTV Service, for example, to create an account, post comments, receive a newsletter, or enter a contest.  Registration Information may include, for example, name, email address, gender, post code and birthday.  

Public Information and Posts consist of comments or content that eligible users post to the BabyTV Services and the information about the user that accompanies those posts or content, which may include a name, user name, comments, likes, status, profile information and picture.  Public Information and Posts are always public, which means they are available to everyone and may be displayed in search results on external search engines.     
  
Information from Social Media.  If you have a social media account and are eligible to access or log-in to a BabyTV Service through a social media service or connect a BabyTV Service to a social media service, the information we collect may also include your user ID and/or user name associated with that social media service, any information or content you have permitted the social media service to share with us, such as your profile picture, email address or friends lists, and any information you have made public in connection with that social media service.  When you access the BabyTV Services through social media services or when you connect a BabyTV Service to social media services, you are authorizing BabyTV to collect, store, and use such information and content in accordance with this Privacy Policy.    

Activity Information.  When you access and interact with the BabyTV Services, we may collect certain information about those visits.  For example, in order to permit your connection to the BabyTV Services, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, including potentially your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information.  If you access the BabyTV Services from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device or other transactional information for that device.  BabyTV uses these types of information to support the internal operations of the BabyTV Services. At this time we do not respond to browser ‘Do Not Track’ signals, as we await the work of interested stakeholders and others to develop standards for how such signals should be interpreted.

Cookies and other similar technologies (such as browser cookies, pixels, beacons, and Adobe Flash technology including cookies) are comprised of small bits of data that often include a de-identified or anonymous unique identifier.  Websites and other services send this data to your browser when you first request a web page and then store the data on your computer so the website can access information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that service.  These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the BabyTV Services, such as pages you have visited, content you have viewed, search queries you have run and advertisements you have seen.  These types of information are used to support the internal operations of the BabyTV Services.

Third parties that support the BabyTV Services by serving contextual advertisements or providing services, such as allowing eligible users to share content or compiling aggregate BabyTV Services usage statistics, may also use these technologies to collect similar information.  BabyTV does not control these third-party technologies and their use is governed by the privacy policies of third parties using such technologies. 

Most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, but you can change your settings to notify you when a cookie is being set or updated, or to block cookies altogether.  Please consult the "Help" section of your browser for more information.  Users can manage the use of Flash technologies, with the Flash management tools available at Adobe’s website, see <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html>.  Please note that by blocking any or all cookies you may not have access to certain features, content or personalization available through the BabyTV Services.

Please visit our Cookie Policy <http://www.babytv.com/informationaboutcookies.aspx> for more information.

**3.     USE AND DISCLOSURE**

We use the information we collect from and about you to provide the BabyTV Services and features to you, including: to measure and improve those BabyTV Services and features; to improve your experience with both online and off-line BabyTV Services by allowing eligible users to comment on content, and participate in online contests or rewards programs; to provide you with customer support and to respond to inquiries.  When the information collected from or about you does not identify you personally, we may use that information for any purpose or share it with third parties.

We may use the information we collect from and about you for these additional purposes:

To allow service providers to assist us in providing and managing the BabyTV Services.   
BabyTV may make your information available to certain third party service providers, such as contractors, agents or sponsors, who help us manage or provide the BabyTV Services.  These service providers may not use personal information for any purpose other than the specific service they are providing to you or BabyTV.  

To allow social sharing functionality.  If you have a social media account and are eligible to log in with or connect a social media service account with BabyTV Services, we may share your user name, picture, and likes, as well as your activities and comments with other BabyTV Services users and with your friends associated with your social media service. We may also share the same information with the social media service provider. By logging in with or connecting your BabyTV Services account with a social media service, you are providing your consent to us to share information we collect from and about you with the social media service provider, other users and your friends and you understand that the social media service’s use of the shared information will be governed by the social media service’s privacy policy.  If you do not want your personal information shared in this way, please do not connect your social media service account with your BabyTV Services account and do not participate in social sharing on BabyTV Services.

To provide co-branded services and features.  We may offer co-branded services or features, such as contests or other promotions together with a third party (“Co-Branded Services”).  These Co-Branded Services may be hosted on BabyTV Services or on the third party’s service.  By virtue of these relationships, if you are eligible to participate, we may share the information you submit in connection with the Co-Branded Service with the third party (where appropriate).  The third party’s use of your information will be governed by the third party’s privacy policy. 

To deliver advertisements.  BabyTV and our service providers may deliver contextual ads to you when you use the BabyTV Services.   

To contact you.  BabyTV may periodically send notifications related to the BabyTV Services to eligible users, such as notifications of changes to the BabyTV Services or policies. 

To send promotion or marketing materials. BabyTV may periodically send eligible users promotional materials, where appropriate.  If you want to stop receiving promotional materials, you can change your account setting by sending an "unsubscribe" email to [remove@babytvchannel.com](mailto:remove@babytvchannel.com) or follow the unsubscribe instructions in our communications.    
  
To share with our BabyTV Affiliates.  BabyTV may share eligible users’ information with BabyTV Affiliates for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.  A link to a website that lists BabyTV Affiliates can be found at the beginning of this policy.  Users who visit BabyTV Affiliates’ services should still refer to their separate privacy policies, which may differ in some respects from this Privacy Policy. 

To share with business partners.  If you are an eligible user, BabyTV may share your information with business partners to permit them to send you marketing communications where appropriate.  If you want to stop receiving these marketing communications you should contact the relevant business partner.

To protect the rights of BabyTV and others.  There may be instances when BabyTV may otherwise use or disclose your information, including situations where BabyTV has a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary in order to: (i) protect, enforce, or defend the legal rights, privacy, safety, or property of BabyTV, our BabyTV Affiliates or our or their respective employees, agents and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements and our terms of use); (ii) protect the safety, privacy, and security of users of the BabyTV Services or members of the public; (iii) protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; (iv) comply with the law or legal process; or (v) respond to requests from public and government authorities.  

To complete a merger or sale of assets.  If BabyTV sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of its assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or transfer of all or a material part of its business, BabyTV may transfer your information to the party or parties involved in the transaction as part of that transaction. 

**4.     SECURITY**

BabyTV uses commercially reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard information in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. However, no one can guarantee the complete safety of your information. 

**5.     USER ACCESS AND CONTROL **

In certain jurisdictions, you have certain rights to see information we hold about you.  Any request for such information may be subject to a small fee to meet our costs in providing you with such details.  Please email us at [info@babytvchannel.com](mailto:info@babytvchannel.com) or write to us at Legal Team, 10 Hammersmith Grove, Hammersmith, London W6 7AP, United Kingdom if you would like further information on this. 

If you would like to access, review, correct, update, suppress, or otherwise limit our use of your personal information you have previously provided directly to us, you may contact us [info@babytvchannel.com](mailto:info@babytvchannel.com).  We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable.

We give eligible users many choices regarding our use and disclosure of their personal information for marketing purposes.  Eligible users may opt-out from:

•    Receiving electronic communications from us:  If you no longer want to receive marketing-related emails from us on a going-forward basis, you may opt-out of receiving these marketing-related emails by sending an email to [remove@babytvchannel.com](mailto:remove@babytvchannel.com). 

•    Our sharing of your personal information with BabyTV Affiliates for their marketing purposes:  If you would prefer that we do not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with BabyTV Affiliates for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this sharing by sending an email to [remove@babytvchannel.com](mailto:remove@babytvchannel.com).

•    Our sharing of your personal information with business partners for their marketing purposes:  If you would prefer that we do not share your personal information on a going-forward basis with business partners for their direct marketing purposes, you may opt-out of this sharing by sending an email to [remove@babytvchannel.com](mailto:remove@babytvchannel.com).

**6.     OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION**  
  
Updates to Privacy Policy.  BabyTV may modify this Privacy Policy.  Please look at the Effective Date at the top of this Privacy Policy to see when this Privacy Policy was last revised.  Any changes to this Privacy Policy will become effective when we post the revised Privacy Policy on the BabyTV Services.  

Location of Data.  BabyTV is a global company and we provide the Baby TV Services from several countries, including the United Kingdom, Israel, and the United States.  Your personal information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, and by using the BabyTV Services, you consent to the transfer of information to countries outside of your country of residence, including the United States, which may have different data protection rules than those of your country.  This includes the use of cookies and other similar technologies as described above.  As a result, please read this Privacy Policy with care.

Linked Services.  The BabyTV Services may be linked to sites operated by unaffiliated companies, and may carry advertisements or offer content, functionality, games, newsletters, contests or applications developed and maintained by unaffiliated companies. BabyTV is not responsible for the privacy practices of unaffiliated companies, and once you leave the BabyTV Services or click an advertisement, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the other service.    

Collection of Personal Financial Information by a Payment Service. In some cases, we may use an unaffiliated payment service to allow you to purchase a product or service or make payments (“Payment Service”).  If you wish to purchase a product or make a payment using a Payment Service, you will be directed to a Payment Service webpage.  Any information that you provide to a Payment Service will be subject to the applicable Payment Service's privacy policy, rather than this Privacy Policy.  We have no control over, and are not responsible for, any Payment Service's use of information collected through any Payment Service. 

  Data Retention.  We will retain your information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or allowed by law.  

Remember that even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.  Because of the nature of caching technology, your account may not be instantly inaccessible to others.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  It is not always possible to completely remove or delete all of your information due to technical constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements. 

Sensitive Information.  We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personal information (such as social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the BabyTV Services or otherwise.
