**Security**  
Security is very important to Us. Security procedures are in place to protect the confidentiality of Your Information whilst it is retained on Our servers and encrypted if such information is sensitive and is to be passed to different locations around the world. We limit access to personal information about You to those who We believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information in order to do their jobs.  We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with Our legal obligations to protect personal information about You. 

IP addresses  
When Your web browser or email application requests a web page or email from another computer on the Internet, it automatically gives that computer the address where it should send the information. This is called Your computer's "IP address." (IP stands for "Internet protocol.") For most users accessing the Internet from a dial-up Internet service provider (ISP), the IP address will be different every time You log on.

Back to top

**Information collection and use practices**  
We receive IP addresses from all users because this information is automatically reported by Your browser each time You view a web page. Your IP address is also stored in Our user registration databases when You register with the Site. ¬IP addresses may be used for various purposes, including to: (i) diagnose service or technology problems reported by Our users or engineers that are associated with the IP addresses controlled by a specific web company or ISP; (ii) send the most appropriate advertising based on geographic area or information derived from Your IP address (iii) aggregate information derived from IP addresses may also be reported to advertisers (iv) estimate the total number of users visiting the Site (v) help determine which You have access privileges to certain content that We host. When a web page is requested and viewed, that request is logged on Our servers with information including the IP address of the computer that requested the page. 

Whilst We take the security of Your personal information seriously no data transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. The following is a summary of the measures We take to protect Your information and descriptions of ways We implement these measures for different types of information You may provide to Us. We continue to evaluate and implement enhancements in security technology and practices, however We can only take steps to help reduce the risks of unauthorised access. Each individual using the Internet can take steps to help protect their information and further minimise the likelihood that a security incident may occur. We describe some of those measures and provide links to information that may be helpful below

** Data storage**  
  
Account Information  
When You register or submit Your Information on the Site, a temporary copy of that information is routinely made to prevent accidental loss of Your Information through a computer malfunction or human error. We keep Your account information active in Our user registration databases in order to provide immediate access to your personalisation preferences each time You visit the Site. If You ask Us to delete Your account, in most cases Your account will be deactivated and then deleted from Our user registration database in approximately [90] days. This delay is necessary to discourage users from engaging in fraudulent activity. Please note that any information that We have copied may remain in back-up storage for some period of time after Your deletion request. This may be the case even though no information about Your account remains in Our active user databases.

Servers  
Our computers (called "servers") that send Your web pages and advertising banners process and store an enormous amount of information every day. These computer records are called "log files." Log files are used for analysis, research, auditing, and other purposes, as described above. After this information has been used, it is stored and is inaccessible. Until the information is stored, Your Personal ID may remain in our active server log files.
