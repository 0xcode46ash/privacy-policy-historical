# Privacy Policy | Baby Bunting

## Our Privacy Commitment

Baby Bunting is committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information. We manage your personal information in an open and transparent way.

Baby Bunting will only use your personal information when it is necessary for us to deliver you a service or perform other necessary business functions and activities.

Baby Bunting will not use or disclose your personal information for purposes unrelated to the services we provide, unless we first obtain your consent.

Where we can, we will allow you to deal with us anonymously or by using a pseudonym. However, in some circumstances, this may not be possible, and Baby Bunting may need to collect personal information from you to provide you with a delivery or other service. In some cases, if you do not provide the required personal information we will not be able to provide you with a service.
