Baby Bunting respects your privacy and is careful about how your personal information is collected, stored, used and shared. You can visit our website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us with any personal information, this will only be used in accordance with this privacy statement.

## **Personal Information**

The personal information we collect is in most cases supplied by you through a customer enquiry, online order, our VIP card program, repair centre, lay-by or marketing promotion.Â  The information collected includes your name, address, phone number, date of birth or age, credit card details, transaction number and email address.

## Security

Baby Bunting has taken all essential measures to ensure all information provided to us, including credit card details, remains private and secure.

When you place an order or access account information, we provide a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information which you have given us to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally require proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.

## Information Sharing

We will often be required to provide your personal details such as your name and address to third party companies who perform part of our service delivery & installation such as fulfillment contractors and mail houses. We may also disclose personal information to government authorities as required by law. In these circumstances, Baby Bunting will ensure that these third parties undertake to protect your privacy at all times. When you provide your details to us, and have not advised us to the contrary, you are authorising Baby Bunting to use your personal information on your behalf in this instance.

If you believe that any information we are holding on you is incorrect or incomplete, please contact us at [enquiries@babybunting.com.au](mailto:enquiries@babybunting.com.au).

However, once you have used these links to leave our site, please note that we do not have any control over the third party site.
