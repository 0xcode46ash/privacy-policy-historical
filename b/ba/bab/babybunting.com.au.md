# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us and we will always respect and protect your information. Baby Bunting takes this responsibility seriously and is very careful about how and when your personal information is collected, used and shared. We have structured our web site so that, in general, you can visit the website without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information.

### Security

Baby Bunting has taken all essential measures to make sure that any information you give us, including credit card details, remains private and secure and that your payment and registration information is processed with total confidentiality.

When you place orders or access account information, we offer the use of a secure server. The secure server software (SSL) encrypts all information you input before it is sent to us. Furthermore, we follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of information, which you have given us, to prevent unauthorised access. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally require proof of identity before we are able to disclose sensitive information to you.
