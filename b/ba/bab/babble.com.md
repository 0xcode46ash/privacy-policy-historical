# Privacy Policy | Babble

Effective on November 1, 2011

This privacy statement describes how Babble collects and uses the personal information you provide on our website: [www.babble.com](http://www.babble.com/). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. By using or accessing the Babble website, you agree to the privacy practices outlined below. 

**Information Collection & Use **

**Personal Information**

In the course of using our website, we may collect the following personal information from you: 

  * Contact Information such as name and email address

  * Unique Identifiers such as user name and password

  * Health Information such as pregnancy status and due date

  * Demographic information such as age, education, gender, interests and zip code.




**Anonymous Information**

We may automatically collect certain aggregated data regarding your use of the website, like the number and location of users, and frequency and manner of usage of the website. Aggregated information is anonymous, statistical information that reflects the scope of our user base, customer patterns and related information. 

As is true of most websites, we also automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, and operating system. We also may keep track of some of the actions you take on our website, such as indicating you “like” or share content a post. 

We use cookies (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer), to keep track of your preferences and to make our advertising better. We also use electronic images known as web beacons that are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our website is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. 

We use a variety of services hosted by third parties to help provide the website and to help us understand use of the website. These third party services may place cookies on your computer or use web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information to compile aggregated statistics for us about visitors to our site. 

**Information Obtained from Third Parties**

We purchase marketing data about our customers from third parties and combine it with information we already have about you, to create more tailored advertising and products. 

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

We may institute programs with advertising partners and other websites in which they share information with us. We may ask advertisers to tell us how our users responded to the ads we showed them (and for comparison purposes, how other users who didn’t see the ads acted on their site). This data sharing helps us measure our advertising effectiveness and improve the quality of the advertisements you see.

We may receive information about whether or not you’ve seen or interacted with certain ads on other sites in order to measure the effectiveness of those ads.

We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with our business activities such as sending newsletters. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us. 

We may also disclose your personal information:
