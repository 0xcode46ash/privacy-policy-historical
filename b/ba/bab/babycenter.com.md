BabyCenter Privacy Policy

**BabyCenter Respects Your Privacy**

BabyCenter respects your privacy and pledges to earn and keep your trust. All personal information you give us is kept confidential and protected with the utmost care, and will not be used in ways to which you have not consented. We will not sell or disclose any information that identifies you to a third party without your approval. In addition, when you place an order at the BabyCenter Store, your personal information and credit card information is safe. Please continue to read our privacy policy for more details. 

  
**TRUSTe Certified**  


[](https://www.truste.org/validate/3098)

BabyCenter is a member of the TRUSTe program and follows TRUSTe's privacy principles. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit organization whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting the principles of disclosure and informed consent. Because BabyCenter wants to demonstrate its commitment to your privacy, it has agreed to disclose its information practices and have its privacy practices reviewed and audited for compliance by TRUSTe. 

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to the BabyCenter site coordinator at [feedback@babycenter.com](mailto:feedback@babycenter.com). If the web site has not responded to your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, please contact [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.org/users/watchdog.html).

  
**Your Personal Information**

BabyCenter will not collect any personal information about you except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, if you would like to register on our site to take advantage of certain features, like a customized personal page, then we ask for your e-mail address. 

If you register, you can also sign up to receive other offers and information from BabyCenter and other qualified merchants. These qualified merchants are prescreened organizations or companies whose products or services we believe are of interest to parents and parents-to-be. But if you don't want these offers, simply check the "no information" box as you register. If you sign up to receive the offers but later decide you don't want them, then [follow this link](https://web.archive.org/register/unsubscribe) to unsubscribe to any mailings. 

Our site has public areas such as chat rooms and message boards. Please remember that any information you share in these areas becomes public, so you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. If you post comments about BabyCenter products or services on our site, there's a chance we may publish them for editorial purposes or in promotional advertising and/or marketing materials (especially if you say nice things about us). 

  
**E-mail Services**

You can sign up for free e-mail newsletters at BabyCenter including: 

  * BabyCenter Weekly -- our general newsletter with features, news and polls.
  * The Baby Bulletin -- a newsletter written specially for your stage of pregnancy or your baby's age. 
  * What's in Store for You -- The BabyCenter Store newsletter with products, sales and events.

**E-mail This to a Friend Service**

You can choose to electronically forward a story from our site to a friend by entering their e-mail address. We do not use the e-mail address for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We do not rent or sell these e-mail addresses. 

**Security**

When you place an order at the BabyCenter Store, your personal information and credit card information is safe. That's because we've taken steps to ensure a secure and superior shopping environment. We have state-of-the-art encryption technology that protects the transmission and storage of your credit card information. So it's virtually impossible for your information to be stolen or intercepted while being transferred to BabyCenter. And, of course, we won't sell or disclose your personal credit card information to others. 

  
**Cookies**

At times, we use a feature of your Web browser to send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We do not and cannot use cookies to retrieve personal information from your computer. We use cookies to enhance your experience at BabyCenter, and to give you better, more personalized service once you've purchased or registered. We use this information for internal use only, we don't share it with others. 

  
**Online Surveys and Contests**

Sometimes we conduct user surveys to improve our site for you. We may share aggregate, or summary, information about our users with partners or other third parties. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female. But we will not sell or share any information at the individual user level. Sometimes we offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. For example, we might require your name and e-mail address. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event. 

  
**Online Birth Announcements**

If you create a birth announcement, we will send you a URL specific to you alone. Your birth announcement is not searchable on our site. However, some people might be able to guess your URL and see your announcement. So if you are concerned about including certain information in the announcement, don't add it to your page.   


  
**Sponsored Educational Areas**

BabyCenter hosts sponsored content pages that are paid for by advertisers. They are designed to provide high-quality, educational information that we believe will be of interest to you. We clearly identify these pages so that you know what area of the site you're visiting. The sponsored content pages are written, edited, and fact-checked by the BabyCenter staff before being sent to the sponsor for review. We accept sponsorships only from trusted, reputable companies, such as Johnson & Johnson or Procter & Gamble. These sponsored educational areas are held to the same high standards as BabyCenter content that is not sponsored. We will never publish any information we believe to be erroneous or misleading. 

  
**Sponsored Promotional Pages**

BabyCenter also hosts sponsored promotional pages for advertisers who offer product and promotional information that might be of interest to you, including contests, free samples, discounts, etc. These pages are clearly identified. Sometimes the advertiser or BabyCenter will request personal information to enter the promotion. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information is posted during the event. And, the personal information that is obtained is only used in relation to the promotion.
