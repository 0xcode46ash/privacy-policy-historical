All personal and demographic information gathered through any type of product ordering process remains the property of BabyNames.com LLC and may be used to send you site newsletters and special offers from our business partner companies. 

## User Profiles

Upon registration, BabyNames.com creates a public user profile page for you. Each part of your profile can be hidden from public view by logging in and going to MY PROFILE and then PRIVACY SETTINGS. The following fields are set to public by default, but can be changed at any time:

## Your IP Address

## Links

You have the option to add or remove yourself from the monthly newsletter and mailings for special discounts and offers from our partners. To change your subscription, login and go to MY PROFILE.

We take great care in making sure our users are not bombarded with email, and we will **_never sell_** or share your personal information with any other company. When you receive a special offer from one of our advertisers, it will come from our server, as we send them out on the advertiser's behalf. We also ensure that every email you receive from BabyNames.com contains a link to remove yourself from the mailing list, just in case you change your mind.
