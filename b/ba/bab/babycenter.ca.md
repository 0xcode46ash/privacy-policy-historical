**• Our pledge**  
BabyCenter respects your privacy and pledges to earn and keep your trust. All personal information you give us is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy and will not be used in ways that are contrary to that policy. 

**• Use of information**  
Information collected by BabyCenter about its users is used internally by authorized employees of BabyCenter and its affiliates for three main purposes: First, we collect information to figure out which areas, features, and products our users like the most and find most helpful, so we can continue to improve the site. Second, we collect information in order to personalize the site for our users (for example, it allows us to recommend products or features based on what you have liked in the past). Finally, we collect information to enable our users to participate in sweepstakes, contests, services, and other activities on our site. 

On occasion, BabyCenter may also share non-personal, summary information about our users with unrelated third parties (for example, we publicly disclose how many people have signed up for BabyCenter membership). However, BabyCenter will not share personally identifiable information about any particular user with unrelated third parties unless the user has specifically agreed to sharing it. 

BabyCenter also uses certain third-party advertising services (including, in particular, DoubleClick) to display advertising for our advertisers. These third-party services may place a cookie on your computer for the purposes of ad tracking and presentation. (See "Cookies and IP Addresses," below, if you're not sure what a cookie is.) BabyCenter does not share personally identifiable information about users with DoubleClick or any other advertising service. If you'd like to know more about the information-gathering practices and "opt-out" procedures of DoubleClick, [click here](http://www.doubleclick.net/privacy_policy/). 

**• Parental consent for kids' information**  
BabyCenter is designed for adults. Therefore, BabyCenter generally doesn't collect personal information about babies and children other than from their parents, and we won't collect personal information about babies or children without first getting their parents' consent. After giving consent, parents will also have the option of reviewing, changing, or deleting a child's personal information, revoking the consent, or refusing to permit collection of further information. We ask that our users not provide information about a baby or child without first getting the parents' consent. Examples of personal information include full name, home address, e-mail address, and phone number. 

**• E-mail this to a friend service**  
You can choose to electronically forward a story from our site to a friend by entering the friend's e-mail address. We don't use your friend's e-mail address for any purpose other than to send your e-mail. We don't rent or sell the addresses used in our E-mail This to a Friend service. 

**• Cookies and IP addresses**  
We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer. To find out what cookies and IP addresses are, keep reading. 

_Cookies:_ At times we send your computer a "cookie," a small data file that's stored on your hard drive. We use cookies to give you better, more personalized service once you've bought something from us or become a member of BabyCenter. This information is for internal use only; we don't share it with others. You're always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly for you if you do.   
Note: You'll see advertising on our site that originates with outside advertisers and/or advertising agencies. In some cases, if you click on or view these ads, the advertiser will assign a cookie. BabyCenter does not control these cookies. 

_IP address tracking:_ All computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. Collecting IP addresses allows us to administer and analyze our site and report non-personal information (such as how many members we have) to sponsors and advertisers. When you call up a BabyCenter page on your computer, BabyCenter's servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. To maintain our users' anonymity, BabyCenter does not associate IP addresses with records containing personal information. 

**• Other sites**  
Please note that if you provide any information on your own or directly to parties who provide service to our network or to Internet sites other than BabyCenter (even if these sites display the BabyCenter name and logo in addition to their own), different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of any personal information you might give them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties. 

**• Online surveys and contests**  
Sometimes we conduct user surveys to find out how we can improve our site for you. We may share non-personal information about our users with partners or other third parties. For example, we might disclose that a certain percentage of our users are female. But we will not sell personal information to or share any personal information with an unrelated third party without your consent. Sometimes we and our sponsors offer contests and sweepstakes in which we request certain personal information. For example, a sponsor might require your name and e-mail address to participate in a contest. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event, and those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. 

**• General security**  
Your credit card, your personal information, and your password are safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to your data. 

**• Sponsored educational areas**  
BabyCenter publishes "sponsored content" pages, which are paid for by advertisers. These provide high-quality, educational information that we believe will be of interest to you. We clearly identify these pages so you'll know which area of the site you're visiting. Sponsored content pages are written, edited, and fact-checked by the BabyCenter staff before being sent to the sponsor for review, and are held to the same high standards as BabyCenter content that is not sponsored. We never publish information we believe to be erroneous or misleading. And we accept sponsorships only from trusted, reputable companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble. 

**• Sponsored promotional pages**  
BabyCenter also publishes promotional pages sponsored by advertisers who offer product and promotional information that might be of interest to you, including contests, free samples, discounts, etc. We clearly identify these pages. Sometimes the advertiser or BabyCenter will request personal information from users. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information is posted during the event. Different rules may apply to these sponsors' use or disclosure of any personal information you might give them. We encourage you to investigate and ask questions before disclosing information to third parties. 

**• Reviewing and changing your member profile**  
As a member of BabyCenter, you can review and change the information in your Member Profile at any time. To do that, [click here](http://www.babycenter.com/members/profile). 

**• Changes**  
BabyCenter may modify this privacy policy at any time, and such modifications shall be effective as soon as the modified policy is posted. Accordingly, you agree to review the policy periodically, and your continued access or use of this site shall be deemed your acceptance of the modified agreement. 

**• Limits on our abilities**  
Although your privacy is very important to us, in the existing legal regulatory and security environment, we cannot fully ensure that your private communications and other personal information will not be disclosed to third parties. For example, under certain circumstances the government or unrelated third parties might force us to disclose information to them, or third parties might unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. Additionally, in the unlikely event we need to investigate or resolve possible problems or inquiries, we can (and you authorize us to do so) disclose any information about you to private entities and law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate.   


**• Security for personal information**  
BabyCenter won't intentionally collect any personally identifiable information about you except when you specifically provide us with it. For example, if you become a member of BabyCenter to take advantage of certain features, such as the My Baby This Week developmental newsletter, we ask for your e-mail address. When you sign up for BabyCenter membership, you can also sign up to receive promotional offers and information from BabyCenter and other qualified merchants. These qualified merchants are prescreened organizations or companies whose products or services we believe are of interest to parents and parents-to-be. But if you don't want to receive these offers, simply uncheck the Additional Offers box as you sign up. If you sign up to receive the offers but later decide you don't want them, just [click here](http://www.babycenter.com/members/profile) to go to your Member Profile page, where you can unsubscribe by unchecking the Additional Offers box. 

We won't sell or disclose your personally identifiable information to unrelated third parties without your consent. However, on particular pages where we ask for your personal information, we may explicitly tell you that the data we're collecting on that page might be shared with third parties, such as our sponsors or parties providing services to our users. In such cases, those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. For example, before you submit answers to questions we ask in an advertiser-sponsored promotion or service, we'll tell you that your answers might be shared with that advertiser. In all of these cases, we'll collect personally identifiable information only if you voluntarily submit it to us or our sponsors. 

Our site also has public areas such as chat rooms and message boards. Please remember that any information you share in these areas becomes public, so you should be careful about what you disclose. If you post comments about BabyCenter products or services on our site, there's a chance we'll publish them for editorial purposes or in promotional advertising and/or marketing materials (especially if you say nice things about us). See our [Terms of Use](http://www.babycenter.com/topic/copyrights.html).
