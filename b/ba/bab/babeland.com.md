# Privacy Policy - Babeland

Toys in Babeland Privacy Policy.

  


###  Your privacy is as important to us as it is to you. 

Our privacy policy is strict but simple. We will never sell, rent, or share any information about you or your order to any company or individual. Third Party vendors (such as FedEx) are given only the information they need to help us fulfill your order.

### Sensitive information is encrypted.

All sensitive information, like your credit card number or contact information, is encrypted. If you are paying by credit card, the charges on your credit card statement will read " **TIB 800-658-9119** ".  We do not share any credit card information.

### Shipments are discreetly packaged.

All shipments are discreetly packaged in plain brown boxes, padded envelopes, or FedEx/USPS supplied packaging. Our name appears as "Mailorder" on the return address and our logo does not appear anywhere on the outside of the packaging. Our packaging makes no mention of the nature of the contents, except when required by international customs regulations. For international shipments, where we must describe package contents, the descriptions are discreet and generic—i.e., "lotion" or "plastic toy".

### No unwanted contact.

Babeland does not create or send unsolicited phone calls, email, or postal mail. Emails are automatically sent to confirm your order, notify you about backorders, and supply you with the tracking number for your shipment. We contact customers by phone only when there is a question about or problem with an order. A catalog is included in every order; additional catalogs are sent only by request. We periodically send email newsletters, which you will receive only if you subscribe either on our site or during the check-out process. You may unsubscribe at any time. From time to time we may send out promotions to existing customers. If you ever receive any contact from us that you do not want, please email [Customer Service](http://www.babeland.com/about/contactus/mailorder) with information about the contact so that we can make sure it doesn't happen again. If you are receiving our newsletter but do not wish to, please [click here](http://www.babeland.com/about/unsubscribe-briefs) if you would like to unsubscribe.

### Write us anonymously.

Our mission is to promote and celebrate sexual vitality by providing an honest, open and fun environment for learning about sex and purchasing sex toys. In keeping with that mission, any sex tips, stories, product reviews, or other writings you submit to us are kept anonymous, unless you request otherwise. Contest entries can be submitted under a false name; if you do so, you will need to certify that you are over 18. To receive any prizes, the winner will need to supply us with a real name and mailing address, which will be used only for shipping purposes and never published.

### Cookies
