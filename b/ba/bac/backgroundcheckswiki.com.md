# Privacy Policy | BackgroundChecksWiki

## **General Scope**

This privacy policy (“ **Privacy Policy** ”) covers personal identifiable information (including names, business phone numbers, and business e-mail addresses, the location of the business of the users) collected or stored by BackgroundChecksWiki.com on its servers in relation to the users of the Wiki and their communities. By submitting or providing information for registration with BackgroundChecksWiki.com, a user consents to the use of that information as set out in this Privacy Policy. Q2 Private Limited (“ **Q2** ”) which operates BackgroundChecksWiki.com will update and/or amend this Privacy Policy. Continued use of BackgroundChecksWiki.com will signify a user’s agreement to any such changes. 

## The public and collaborative nature of the Wiki

All directories of BackgroundChecksWiki.com are collaboratively developed by its users using BackgroundChecksWiki.com. Anyone with Internet access (and not otherwise restricted from doing so) may edit the publicly editable pages of these site after logging in as a registered user. By doing this, editors create a published document, and a public record of every word added, subtracted, or changed. This is a public act, and editors are identified publicly as the author of such changes. All contributions made to a directory, and all publicly available information about those contributions, are irrevocably licensed and may be copied, quoted, reused and adapted by third parties.

## Activities on BackgroundChecksWiki.com Projects

In general, this Privacy Policy only applies to private information stored or held by BackgroundChecksWiki.com which is not publicly available. Interactions with the Wiki not covered by this Privacy Policy include, but are not limited to, aspects of browsing and editing pages, use of the wiki “email user” function, subscribing and posting to BackgroundChecksWiki.com forums, and corresponding with volunteers via BackgroundChecksWiki.com’s ticketing system. These interactions may reveal a contributor’s IP address, and possibly other personal information, indiscriminately to the general public, or to specific groups of volunteers acting independently of BackgroundChecksWiki.com.  
Users may also interact with one another outside of BackgroundChecksWiki.com sites, via email, Internet Relay Chat or other chat, or independent websites, and should assess the risks involved, and their personal need for privacy, before using these methods of communication.

## User accounts and authorship

BackgroundChecksWiki.com requires editors to register with the wiki. Anyone can edit after logging in with a username. Users are identified by their chosen username. Users select a password, which is confidential and used to verify the integrity of their account. It is the responsibility of the users to remember to log off from his account and to close the browser window after use so that no unauthorised party can have access to his account. No user shall, at any time, divulge any of his passwords to any third party. A user shall not: (i) give false or erroneous information, assume a false identity, or give any false information or the identity of another user, when using and/or registering for the use of BackgroundChecksWiki.com, (ii) use the BackgroundChecksWiki.com for any unlawful or illegal activities, including but not limited to spamming, harassing or otherwise causing distress to other users, and (iii) take any action that might compromise the security of the site, render the site inaccessible to others or otherwise cause damage to the site.  Users are prohibited from using BackgroundChecksWiki.com in any manner that might interfere with the rights of third parties.   
Except insofar as it may be required by law, no person should disclose, or knowingly expose, either user passwords and/or cookies generated to identify a user. Once created, user accounts will not be removed unless there is a violation of the Terms of Use.  BackgroundChecksWiki.com does not guarantee that a username will be changed on request.  


## Use and Purpose of the collection of private information

The collection of personal identifiable user data will be used for purposes including but not limited to the following:   


  1. To enhance the public accountability of the Wiki. BackgroundChecksWiki.com recognizes that any system that is open enough to allow the greatest possible participation of the general public will also be vulnerable to certain kinds of abuse and counterproductive behavior. BackgroundChecksWiki.com and the project communities have established a number of mechanisms to prevent or remedy abusive activities. For example, when investigating abuse on a project, including the suspected use of malicious “sockpuppets” (duplicate accounts), vandalism, harassment of other users, or disruptive behavior, the IP addresses of users (derived either from those logs or from records in the database) may be used to identify the source(s) of the abusive behavior. This information may be shared by users with administrative authority who are charged by their communities with protecting the Wiki.
  2. To provide site statistics. BackgroundChecksWiki.com statistically samples raw log data from users’ visits. These logs are used to produce the site statistics pages; the raw log data is not made public.
  3. To solve technical problems. Log data may be examined by developers in the course of solving technical problems and in tracking down the use of banned web spiders. 
  4. Marketing, research and other purposes. Personal identifiable information may be stored and used by Q2 and/or its subsidiaries. Such information may be processed and used for marketing, research and other purposes and may be provided to contractors acting on Q2's behalf, Q2’s business partners who promote, market, and support certain Q2 products and services, and assignees of Q2 and its subsidiaries. You agree, unless you have requested Q2 not to do so, that Q2 may send you information about Q2 and others' products and services, including by email. 



We also reserve the right to use, disclose, sell, trade or rent data aggregated by us provided that the data is not linked to any specific individual.  We will take reasonable commercial efforts to ensure that these third parties comply with our Privacy Policy, however please note that we shall not be liable to you if any person fails to do so. 

## Sale of Business

If this business and/or BackgroundChecksWiki.com is sold or integrated with another business, the data or information provided by users may be disclosed to the BackgroundChecksWiki.com’s advisers and any prospective purchasers and their advisers, and  may be passed on to the new owners of the business.  


## Details of data retention

  
_**General**_

_**IP and other technical information**_

When a visitor requests or reads a page, or sends email to BackgroundChecksWiki.com, no more information is collected than is typically collected by web sites. BackgroundChecksWiki.com may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users.  
When a page is edited by a logged-in editor, the server confidentially stores related IP information for a limited period of time. This information is automatically deleted after a set period.

**_Cookies_**

BackgroundChecksWiki.com sets a temporary session cookie on a visitor’s computer whenever one of its pages is visited. Generally, a cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer. Cookies provide BackgroundChecksWiki.com with information about the use of the site by a user so that BackgroundChecksWiki.com and a user’s experience with it may be improved. Readers who do not intend to log in or edit may deny this cookie and it will be deleted at the end of the browser’s session. More cookies may be set when one logs in to maintain logged-in status. If one saves a username or password in one’s browser, that information will be saved for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit to the Wiki. Contributors using a public machine who do not wish to show their username to future users of the machine should clear these cookies after use.

**_Page history_**

Edits or other contributions to a directory on its articles, user pages and talk pages are generally retained indefinitely. Removing text from a project does not permanently delete it. Normally, in a directory, anyone can look at a previous version of an article and see what was there. Even if an article is “deleted”, a user entrusted with higher level of access may still see what was removed from public view. Information may be permanently deleted by individuals with access to BackgroundChecksWiki.com servers, but aside from the rare circumstance when BackgroundChecksWiki.com is required to delete editing-history material in response to a court order or equivalent legal process, there is no guarantee that any permanent deletion will happen.

**_User contribution_**

User contributions are also aggregated and made publicly available on BackgroundChecksWiki.com. User contributions are aggregated according to their registration and login status. Data on user contributions, such as the times at which users edited and the number of edits they have made, are publicly available via user contributions lists, and in aggregated forms published by other users.

_**Reading Projects**_

No more information on users and other visitors reading pages is collected than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside from the above raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor’s identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly.

_**Editing Projects**_

Edits to directory pages are identified with the username of the editor, and editing history is aggregated by author in a contribution list. Such information will be available permanently on the Wiki.

**_Logged in registered users:_ **

Logged in users do not expose their IP address to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of a BackgroundChecksWiki.com page by the user or by another user with the same IP address. A user’s IP address is stored on the wiki servers for a period of time, during which it can be seen by server administrators and by users who have been granted CheckUser access.

IP address information, and its connection to any usernames that share it, may be released under certain circumstances (see below). 

Editors using a company mail server from home or telecommuting over a DSL or cable Internet connection, are likely to be easily identified  by their IP address; in which case it may be easy to cross-identify all contributions to various Projects made by that IP address. Using a username is a better way of preserving privacy in this situation.

**Discussions**

_On BackgroundChecksWiki.com discussion pages:_

Any editable page can theoretically be the location of a discussion. In general, discussions on BackgroundChecksWiki.com occur on pages specially designated to function as forums (e.g., the Forums or Live Chat). This Privacy Policy does not apply to such discussion pages and visitors and users should note that privacy expectations apply to such discussion pages in the same way as they do elsewhere.

_On mailing lists:_

The email addresses used to subscribe and post are exposed to other users. BackgroundCheckswiki.com will send all registered users a monthly update on the Wiki. The user may unsubscribe to this newsletter at anytime.

_Via “Discussion and Feedback”:_

Some e-mail addresses (such as info@BackgroundChecksWiki.com) forward mail to a team of volunteers trusted by BackgroundChecksWiki.com to use a ticket system, such as “ _Discussion and Feedback_ ”, to respond. Mail sent to this system is not publicly visible, but volunteers selected by BackgroundChecksWiki.com will have access to it. The ticket system team may discuss the contents of received mail with other contributors in order to respond effectively. Mail to private addresses of members of Q2 and to staff of BackgroundChecksWiki.com may also be forwarded to the “ _Discussion and Feedback_ ” team. These messages and e-mail addresses may be saved by members of the “ _Discussion and Feedback_ ” team and any email service they use, and may remain available to them.

## Access to and release of personal identifiable information

_Access:_   
Some users who may have access to personal identifiable information include, but are not limited to, users who have access to “ _Discussion and Feedback_ ”, users chosen by Q2 to serve as site administrators , Q2 or BackgroundChecksWiki.com’s employees, trustees, appointees, and contractors and agents employed by BackgroundChecksWiki.com, and developers and others with high levels of server access.

_Release: Policy on Release of Data_

Personal identifiable data collected in the server logs, or through records in the database, or through other non-publicly-available methods, may be released by BackgroundChecksWiki.com volunteers or staff, in any of the following non-exhaustive situations:

  1. In response to a valid subpoena or other compulsory request from law enforcement; 
  2. With permission of the affected user;
  3. When necessary for investigation of abuse complaints; 
  4. Where the information pertains to page views generated by a spider or bot and its dissemination is necessary to illustrate or resolve technical issues; 
  5. Where the user has been vandalizing articles or persistently behaving in a disruptive way, data may be released to a service provider, carrier, or other third-party entity to assist in the targeting of IP blocks, or to assist in the formulation of a complaint to relevant Internet Service Providers; and 
  6. Where it is reasonably necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the BackgroundChecksWiki.com, its users or the public.



In the event that BackgroundChecksWiki.com receives a subpoena or other compulsory request from a law-enforcement agency or a court or equivalent government body with respect to the disclosure of information about a registered user, BackgroundChecksWiki.com may be compelled by law to comply with such request. In such event, BackgroundChecksWiki.com will use its reasonable endeavours to notify the affected user within three (3) business days following the receipt of such subpoena by sending a notice by email to the email address (if any) that the affected user has listed in his or her user preferences.  
BackgroundChecksWiki.com cannot advise a user receiving such a notification regarding the law or an appropriate response to a subpoena. Users who wish to oppose a subpoena or other compulsory request should seek professional legal advice concerning applicable rights and procedures that may be available to them.
