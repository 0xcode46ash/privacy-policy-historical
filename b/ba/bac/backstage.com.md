## **1.The Information We Collect and Use**

  * ## Non-Personally Identifiable Information.




## When you visit a Website, we may collect certain data that does not tell us specifically who you are. This is "Non-Personally Identifiable Information." It includes things like your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type, and the last domain you visited before coming to our Website or the domain you go to when you leave. It also includes various statistical data such as which pages you visit on our Websites, how long you stay on them, and what you click.

## We may place a "cookie" on your computer. A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive. Our "preference" cookie expires after thirty (30) days. We may use cookies to keep track of your choice of language and home page preference; to understand your exposure to certain Internet advertisements as you use the Websites, and to gather usage data that will help us generally improve the quality of the Websites. There is a simple procedure in most browsers that allows you to deny or accept cookies. You should note that cookies may be necessary to provide you with certain features on the Websites.

## We also may use a small piece of code (sometimes referred to as "1x1 clear pixel," "Web beacon" or "clear GIF") placed in the pages of the Websites to help us gather additional information about which parts of the site receive the most visitors and other user traffic patterns, and enable us to administer the site.

## No Personally Identifiable Information (see below) is collected through our cookies or Web beacons however we may, from time to time, allow advertisers, third-party advertising networks, and third-party advertising serving companies to serve advertisements directly to you within our Websites, Services, and Software. By serving these advertisements directly to you, these companies can set their own cookies on your computer, which may not expire, and trigger their own Web beacons. If you would like to contact the advertisers, third-party advertising networks, and third-party advertising serving companies with which we have relationships to learn more about their privacy policies and what options (if any) they offer to opt out of their data collection, please visit their web sites. Some of these companies are participants in the Network Advertising Initiative ("NAI"), a cooperative of online marketing and analytics companies committed to building consumer awareness and establishing responsible business and data management practices and standards. You can learn more about NAI and how you may "opt out" of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks at www.networkadvertising.org.
