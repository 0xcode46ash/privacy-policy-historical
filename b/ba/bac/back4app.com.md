                                           Back4App Privacy Policy
Last Updated: Jan 18th 2017
Protecting your privacy is really important to us. With this in mind, we’re providing this Privacy Policy to
explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of information that customers provide to
us in connection with the creation or administration of their Back4App Account. This Privacy Policy does not
apply to any third-party websites, services or applications, even if they are accessible through our Services.
Also, please note that, unless we define a term in this Privacy Policy, all capitalized terms used in this
Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service. So, please make sure that you have read
and understand our Terms of Service.
Revisions to this Privacy Policy
Any information that is collected via our Services is covered by the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such
information is collected. We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make any material
changes to this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the Services or by
sending you an email or other notification, and we’ll update the “Last Updated Date” above to indicate
when those changes will become effective.
End User Data
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the content that Account holders store on our system, including any
personal information of their End Users. Back4App will not disclose, move, access or use such content
except as provided in the Terms of Service or as otherwise permitted by such customer through the
functionality of the Services. If you are an End User of an Application created by a Back4App customer that
is hosted on the Services, please note that the collection, processing and disclosure of your information in
connection with such Application will be governed by the privacy policy published by such customer.
Collection and Use of Information
Information Collected or Received from You
Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your use
of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy and easily
navigate our Services.
Account Information. If you create an Account or submit an inquiry through the Services, we’ll collect
certain information that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal address and
phone number (“PII”). If you purchase a Subscription, we may also collect other information from you (such
as credit card number, expiration date and billing address) that will be associated with your Account. We
may also collect your gender, date of birth and other information that is not considered PII because it
cannot be used by itself to identify you.
Community Participation. When you use the Services to communicate with other Account holders, whether
by public posting, direct message or other communication features available through the Services, such
communications are transmitted and stored by us. These communications are considered public and there
is no expectation of privacy. We may monitor such communications in order to ensure the safety of the
community and, by using the communication features in our Services, you are indicating that you agree to
such monitoring. Please use your judgment when communicating with other Account holders.


Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies. Like many website owners and
operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web Beacons to collect certain
information.
“Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your device by a web server when you access our Services.
We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to identify that you’ve logged in to the Services
and to tell us how and when you interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate
usage and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent
Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log off from the Services and close your browser. Although
most browsers automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop automatically
accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t
accept Cookies, you may not be able to access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party
services providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place their own Cookies on
your device. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only our use of Cookies and does not include use of
Cookies by such third parties.
“Web Beacons” (also known as web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier
that may be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with
Cookies, to track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our
Services, and to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s
device, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record certain information about how
a person uses our Services (we refer to this information as “Log Data”), including both Account holders and
non-Account holders (either, a “User”). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol
(IP) address, browser type, operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our
Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages
or features, search terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log
Data to administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to
improve, customize and enhance our Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring
them to our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to generate aggregate, non-
identifying information about how our Services are used.
Information Sent by Your Mobile Device. We collect certain information that your mobile device sends
when you use our Services, like a device identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as
well as information about your use of our Services.
Location Information. When you use our Services, we may collect and store information about your
location by converting your IP address into a rough geo-location or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS
coordinates or coarse location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location
information to improve and personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location
information, you may disable that feature on your mobile device.
Information that We Share with Third Parties
We will not share any PII that we have collected from or regarding you except as described below:
Information Shared with Other Account Holders. When you use the Services to communicate with other
Account holders, whether by public posting, direct message or other communication features available
through the Services, your communications will be shared with such other Account holders.


Information Shared with Our Services Providers. We may engage third-party services providers to work with
us to administer and provide the Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only
for the purpose of performing services on our behalf and are expressly obligated not to disclose or use your
PII for any other purpose.
For example, we may share your PII and any necessary payment information, such as credit card number,
expiration date and billing address, with our payment processing services providers in order to check the
financial qualifications of prospective customers and to complete transactions that are initiated through the
Services.
Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and non-identifying
information with third parties for industry research and analysis, demographic profiling and other similar
purposes.
Information Shared with Web Analytics Services Providers.
Google. We utilize Google Analytics, a service provided by Google, Inc. (“Google”), to gather information
about how users engage with our Site and Services. For more information about Google Analytics, please
visit www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/. You can opt out of Google’s collection and processing of
data generated by your use of the Services by going to http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.
Facebook. We may use certain tools offered by Facebook, Inc. (“Facebook”) that enable it to collect or
receive information about actions users take on (a) our Site and elsewhere on the internet through use of
Cookies, Web Beacons and other storage technologies; or (b) mobile applications, in order to provide
measurement services, targeted ads and other services. For more information regarding the collection and
use of such information by Facebook, please see the Facebook Data Policy, available at:
https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
Opt-out of Ad Tracking, You can opt out of the collection and use of your information for ad targeting by
going to http://www.aboutads.info/choices or http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/ to limit collection
through the Site or by configuring the settings on your mobile device to limit ad tracking through the App.
Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that we collect from our
users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset. Thus, if we are acquired by a third party as a result
of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale or if our assets are acquired by a third party in
the event we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, some or all of our assets, including your PII, may be
disclosed or transferred to a third party acquirer in connection with the transaction.
Information Disclosed for Our Protection and the Protection of Others. We cooperate with government and
law enforcement officials or private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any
information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole
discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas);
(ii) to protect our property, rights and safety and the property, rights and safety of a third party or the
public in general; and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally actionable
activity.
Your Choices
We offer you choices regarding the collection, use and sharing of your PII and we’ll respect the choices you
make. Please note that if you decide not to provide us with the PII that we request, you may not be able to
access all of the features of the Services.


Opt-Out. We may periodically send you free newsletters, e-mails and other communications that directly
promote the Services or other Back4App products and services. When you receive such promotional
communications from us, you will have the opportunity to “opt-out” (either through your Account or by
following the unsubscribe instructions provided in the e-mail you receive). We do need to send you certain
communications regarding the Services and you will not be able to opt out of those communications – e.g.,
communications regarding updates to our Terms of Service or this Privacy Policy or information about
billing.
If you provide your cellular phone number and agree to receive communications from Back4App, you
specifically authorize Back4App to send text messages or calls to your phone. You are not required to
consent to receive text messages or calls as a condition of using the services and may opt out of such
messages.
Modifying Your Information. You can access and modify the PII associated with your Account by changing
your account settings. If you want us to delete your PII and your Account, please contact us at
community@back4app.com with your request. We’ll take steps to delete your information as soon we can,
but some information may remain in archived/backup copies for our records or as otherwise required by
law.
Responding to Do Not Track Signals
Our Site does not have the capability to respond to “Do Not Track” signals received from various web
browsers.
The Security of Your Information
We take reasonable administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect the information
that we collect from or about you (including your PII) from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Please
be aware, however, that no method of transmitting information over the Internet or storing information is
completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of any information.
Links to Other Sites
Our Services may contain links to websites and services that are owned or operated by third parties (each, a
“Third-party Service”). Any information that you provide on or to a Third-party Service or that is collected
by a Third-party Service is provided directly to the owner or operator of the Third-party Service and is
subject to the owner’s or operator’s privacy policy. We’re not responsible for the content, privacy or
security practices and policies of any Third-party Service. To protect your information we recommend that
you carefully review the privacy policies of all Third-party Services that you access.
International Transfer
Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of your state, province,
country or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in
your jurisdiction. If you’re located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may
transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.
Our Policy Toward Children
Our Services are not directed to children under 13 and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under
13. If we learn that we have collected PII of a child under 13 we will take steps to delete such information
from our files as soon as possible.
