Updated 4/13/12

This Privacy Policy explains what personal information is collected and how it is used and protected by Backblaze Inc., its websites (including www.backblaze.com), products and services (collectively, the “Service” or “Services”.) Backblaze defines Personal Information as your name, email address or billing information, or other data which can be reasonably linked to such information.   
By using the Services, you expressly consent to the use of data as described in this Privacy Policy.

How Backblaze Uses Information  
Backblaze is committed to providing a high-performance, secure, easy-to-use online backup service. Data collected is used exclusively with the goal of providing and improving this service.  
**No Spam**. Backblaze will not sell, rent, trade or give away your email address or other contact information to any other organization.  
**No Spyware/Adware/Malware.** Backblaze software is designed to backup your files online and contains no spyware or other unwanted applications.  
**No Third Party Advertising.** Backblaze does not intend to advertise for other organizations through its website or email communications.  
**Your Data is Protected.** Backblaze encrypts all data on your system and then sends it to Backblaze over an encrypted connection to ensure your data is secure.  
We aim to provide you an excellent experience with our service. For additional detail on how we handle your data or to contact us with questions, please see the rest of the Privacy Policy below.

Information Collection  
**Website Cookies and Logs**  
When you visit [www.backblaze.com](http://www.backblaze.com/) and other Backblaze websites, our servers automatically collect certain information such as your IP address, browser type, page requested, cookies, etc. This information is used to provide a custom experience, keep your session active, or improve the service.  
**Information You Provide**  
You may provide information such as your name, email address, or other requested information to purchase or use the service. You may also provide us information when you email or call us, or through feedback and other forms on the website.   
**Backup Service**  
By using the online backup service, the system automatically encrypts and transfers your files to Backblaze servers. Certain information will be available to Backblaze such as type of operating system, file types, or sizes to enable Backblaze to provide the service or help support you. Backblaze will never look at your actual files.  
Backblaze does not intentionally gather information about visitors under the age of 13.

Sharing and Disclosures

 **Service Providers**  
Backblaze does not disclose personal information to service providers, except to process credit card transactions. The data used to process credit card transactions adheres to a strict privacy policy supported by TrustE and BBBOnline and is available via: [www.backblaze.com/privacy/creditcard](http://www.backblaze.com/privacy/creditcard). Backblaze may use third party service providers (e.g. hosting providers) and your data will only be stored in encrypted form and only as necessary to provide you the service.  We may share certain aggregated non-personal information (such as total volume of data Backblaze stores) with third parties.  
**Law Enforcement**  
Backblaze may disclose personal data to third parties, with or without notice, (a) where required by law, (b) to protect and defend the rights of Backblaze, (c) or to enforce the Backblaze Terms of Service.   
**Corporate Change**  
If Backblaze is involved in a merger, acquisition, or any form of sale of some or all of its assets, we will provide notice before personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

Security

Backblaze is committed to the security of your data and has put in place industry standard physical and electronic enforcement mechanisms. Backblaze products automatically encrypt your data before transmission and send the encrypted data using industry-standard Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encryption. Your data is stored in a secure location with access controls for authorized employees only.

1) Service related:  Service-related email such as a confirmation of password change, expiration of credit card, notification of a service change or availability of a new product version, or to reply to, or inform you, of a support issue.  You can not opt out of receiving these messages as they are part of the service.  To stop receiving these messages you must discontinue using the service.
