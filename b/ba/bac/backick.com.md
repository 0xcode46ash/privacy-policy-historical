### What information we collect

_Information You Submit._ We receive and store any information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. This includes information that can identify you ("personal information"), including your first and last name, telephone number, postal and email addresses, fax number, and, if you make a reservation through our site, credit card information (such as credit card number, cardholder name, and expiration date). We also may request information about your hotel room preferences and frequent flyer and car rental program information. You can choose not to provide information to us, but in general some information about you is required in order for you to register as a member; reserve a hotel; purchase other products or services; complete a traveler profile; participate in a survey, competition or promotion; ask us a question; or initiate other transactions on our site.

_Travel Companion Information._ When you make a reservation for someone else through this website, we will request personal information and travel preferences about that individual. You should obtain the consent of other individuals prior to providing us with their personal information and travel preferences, as any access to view or change their information will be available only through your account.

_Information from Other Sources._ We also may periodically obtain both personal and non-personal information about you from affiliated entities, business partners and other independent third-party sources and add it to our account information. Examples of information we may receive include: purchase history, and demographic information.

_Facebook._ You may also access Backick through Facebook Connect by clicking on the “Connect with Facebook” icon at the top of our search pages and entering your account information. When you connect in this manner, Facebook will provide us with information that you have chosen to make available pursuant to your Facebook privacy settings. That information may include your name, profile picture, gender, friend lists and any other information you have chosen to make available. Information regarding hotel recommendations or any Backick savings or discounts exchanged between you and your friends may also be shared. Please note that, if you have Facebook friends who are using Backick, they may also have shared information about you with us through Facebook. If you wish to prevent that sharing, you can do so by editing your Facebook privacy settings.

_Call Monitoring._ Calls to and from our customer service help desk may be recorded or monitored for the purpose of quality control and for staff training. Call recordings will be maintained as long as reasonably necessary and will then be deleted. Any personal information obtained from you during the call will be treated in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.

_Automatic Information._ We automatically collect some information about you and your computer or mobile device when you visit this website. For example, we will collect your IP address, Web browser software (such as Firefox, Internet Explorer or Safari), and referring website. We also may collect information about your activity, such as your location, trips viewed and purchases made. One of our goals in collecting this automatic information is to help customize your user experience. For more information, please see Cookies and other Technologies.

### How we use this information

We use credit card information (such as cardholder name, credit card number, and expiration date) for the purpose of completing the travel bookings you conduct on our site. We use other information about you for the following general purposes: to provide you with the products and services you request; to provide you with your hotel booking confirmation and updates; to manage your account, including processing bills and providing travel notifications; to communicate with you in general; to respond to your questions and comments; to allow us to contact you for customer service, if necessary; to measure interest in and improve our products, services, and website; to notify you by email about special offers and travel-related products and services that may be of interest to you; to otherwise customize your experience with this website; to reward you or your Facebook friends as part of any reward and recognition program you choose to participate in; to solicit information from you, including through surveys; to resolve disputes, collect fees, or troubleshoot problems; to prevent potentially prohibited or illegal activities; to enforce our Terms of Use and protect our rights and the rights of others; and as otherwise described to you at the point of collection or with your consent.

_Email Communications._ We want to make it easy for you to take advantage of travel-related opportunities on our website. One way we do this is by sending you email messages that contain information about your travel-related interests. For example, if you search for a hotel in New York on our website but choose not to book your hotel, we may send you an email message telling you about our special deals for hotels in New York. We believe these email messages will provide you with useful information about travel-related special offers. You will have the opportunity to choose not to receive these email messages in any such email we send.

For more information about your choices regarding our use of the information we collect, please review Your choices with respect to the collection and use of your information below.

We may share information that we collect on Backick with the following entities:

_Suppliers_ , such as hotel providers who fulfill your travel reservations. Throughout this website, all services provided by a third-party supplier are described as such. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third-party travel supplier whose products you purchase through this website. Please note that these suppliers also may contact you as necessary to obtain additional information about you, facilitate your hotel stay, or respond to a review you may submit.

_Third-party vendors_ who provide services or functions on our behalf, including credit card processing, business analytics, customer service, marketing, distribution of surveys or sweepstakes programs, and fraud prevention. We may also authorize third-party vendors to collect information on our behalf, including as necessary to operate features of our website or to facilitate the delivery of online advertising tailored to your interests. Third-party vendors have access to and may collect information only as needed to perform their functions and are not permitted to share or use the information for any other purpose.

_Business partners_ with whom we may jointly offer products or services. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product or service you have requested because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you choose to access these optional services, we may share information about you, including information that may identify you, with those partners so that they can contact you directly by email or post about their products and services. 

_Referring websites._ If you were referred to this site from another website, we may share some information about you with that referring website so that they can contact you directly by email or post about their products and services. 

We also may share information collected on Backick in response to subpoenas, court orders, or other legal process; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases we reserve the right to raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

When we believe it is appropriate to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or suspected illegal activities; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company or this website, our customers, or others; and in connection with our Terms of Use and other agreements.

_Companies within our corporate family._ We may share your personal information with our corporate affiliates in the leisure and travel sector. This sharing enables us to provide you with information about products and services, both leisure- and travel-related, which might interest you. To the extent that our corporate affiliates have access to your information, they will follow practices that are at least as restrictive as the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

In connection with a corporate transaction, such as a sale of a subsidiary or a division, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of winding-up.

We also may share aggregate or anonymous information with third parties, including advertisers and investors, for a variety of purposes. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors our websites receive or the most popular hotels in a given city. This information does not contain any information that identifies you specifically and is used to develop content and services we hope you will find of interest and to audit the efficacy of our advertising.

You will also be given the same choices when you fill in any form on our website by which you provide your email address to us.

Whether registered as a member or not, you also will be given the opportunity to unsubscribe from messages in any such email we send.

### Cookies and other technologies

Cookies are small data text files and can be stored on your computer’s hard drive (if your Web browser permits). Backick uses cookies for the following general purposes:

  * To help us recognize you as a previous visitor and save and remember any preferences that may have been set while you were using Backick. For example, if you register on our site, we may use cookies to remember your registration information, so you do not need to log into our site each time you visit. We may also record your password in a cookie, if we provide a check box and you checked the "Keep me logged in" box. 
  * To help measure and research how people use Backick and our other offerings, and to measure viewing of advertisements and email communications (including by determining which emails you open and act upon).



The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. Please note that if you refuse to accept cookies, you may not be able to access all of our features.

In addition to the above cookies, we use Local Shared Objects, also referred to as flash cookies, on our website. These are used to enhance your user experience, for example, by storing your user preferences and settings, such as your volume/mute settings, and in connection with animated content on our website. Local Shared Objects are similar to browser cookies, but can store data more complex than simple text. By themselves, they cannot do anything to or with the data on your computer. Like other cookies, they can only access personally identifiable information that you have provided on this site, and cannot be accessed by other websites. To find out more about flash cookies or how to disable them, please click [here](http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/526/52697ee8.html).

This site may also use Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or Web bugs), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, which are placed in the code of a Web page. We use Web beacons to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within our sites to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you have come to our site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website, and to improve site performance. We also may allow our service providers to use Web beacons to help us understand which emails have been opened by recipients and to track the visitor traffic and actions on our site. This helps us measure the effectiveness of our content and other offerings.

If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at our customer care email address shown below.

### How we protect your information

We want you to feel confident about using this website to make travel arrangements, and we are committed to protecting the information we collect. We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the personal information you provide to us. We want you to know, however, that no website or app can guarantee security, and so you should be careful not to store information on Backick that you consider sensitive.

### Children’s privacy

Backick is intended for use by adults, and we don’t intentionally collect information about children. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will delete that information from our database.

### External links

If any part of this website links you to other websites, those websites do not operate under this Privacy Policy. We recommend you examine the privacy statements posted on those other websites to understand their procedures for collecting, using, and disclosing personal information.

### Visiting our website from outside Singapore

Our website is based in Singapore, and all processing, use, transfer, and storage of data is governed by Singapore law. Users visiting our website from outside Singapore, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in Singapore where our servers are located and our central database is operated. The data protection and other laws of Singapore and other countries might not be as comprehensive as those in your country, but please be assured that Backick does take steps pursuant to laws in Singapore to ensure that your privacy is protected. By using our services, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as descripted in this Policy.
