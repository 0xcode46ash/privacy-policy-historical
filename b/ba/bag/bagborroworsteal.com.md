Your privacy is important to us. 

Safeguarding your privacy and the security of your personal information is important to us. Please take a few minutes to read the following policy so that you understand how we treat your personal information. As we continuously improve and expand our services, this policy might change. So please check it out periodically. If you have questions about our policy, please click on our customer feedback page to contact us via our electronic feedback form.

_**How we collect information about you?**_

We collect information in three ways:

We collect information that our customers supply to us.   
We collect information from emails and other contacts sent to us by our customers and users of our website.   
We collect information electronically on all users of our website, including customers, by means of cookies.   
Further details are provided below. 

_**What personal information we collect from our users?**_

When you set up an account at BagBorroworSteal.com to use our service, you are required to provide us with your full legal name, a valid credit card, email address, full street address including city, state and zip code, and telephone number. You must also choose your Username and Password and provide those to us. 

Every time you use our service, we collect information about the BagBorroworSteal.com products you browse and the orders you place.

We collect additional information about how you use our website and service.   
If you contact us by letter, phone, or email through the contact information on the "Contact Us" page, we will collect your sender information and may collect the other information you voluntarily disclose to us.

_**Our use of cookies.**_

Like many websites on the Internet, our website uses cookies. Cookies are small strings of data placed on users' personal computer hard drives during the exchange of data that happens when your browser points to our website. Cookies enable a website to identify a user's browser as a previous visitor by means of a unique string of numbers assigned on a previous visit. Our cookies assist us in collecting information on what pages of our website you access or visit, and in recording any preferences you indicate on our website. We also use cookies to make your experience on BagBorrowOrSteal.com more personalized, and convenient.

Our cookies cannot and do not retrieve any other data from your hard drive or pass on computer viruses. If you are just browsing our website, a cookie identifies your browser and user id (and not your identity). If you place orders with us, we use cookies to assist in storing your preferences and recording other session information (a "session" is a single visit by you to our website).

_**How we store the information we collect.**_

We store the information you provide to us and the information we collect electronically in our computer databases. We own, maintain and operate our computer servers containing our databases. Access to our computer servers is controlled by firewalls and security gatekeepers.

**_How we use the information we collect._**

We use the personal information about you stored in our member database in various ways. First, the next time you use our service and enter your User ID and Password, we will call up your information from our database to make processing your order faster and easier.

When you use your BagBorrowOrSteal.com account, we also keep track of your brand preferences and bag choices and analyze that information. We do so in order to be able to email to you special advertisements, offers and notices regarding brands and bags that seem to fit with your preferences.

We do aggregate information about how our service is used (without specific identification to any particular user) to be able to improve our service and make it more responsive to our customers' preferences. We also make such aggregate information (without identification to any specific individual) available to our affiliates in order to obtain information about products, services, offers and notices which we believe will be useful and informative to our website users.

**_You can control how information about you is used._**

You can also limit our communications directly to you. If you have a BagBorrowOrSteal.com account and do not want to receive emails telling you about our great deals in the future, please let us know. You can change your preferences, or opt out of receiving emails, at any time (except when you are in the process of placing an order) by going to My Account Information on the log in page. There, you can update your email address, phone numbers, password, address and you can uncheck the "Send me special offers from BagBorroworSteal.com's" box. Our emails to you will stop within 5 business days.

BagBorroworSteal.com may from time to time send nonpromotional email to all registered users for the purpose of gathering and dispersing data to provide better services to our customers. Registered users will be under no obligation to reply or answer questions in said nonpromotional email. Nonpromotional email will include, but will not be limited to, surveys, maintenance notices and system updates.

This is our current privacy and security policy, but we reserve the right to change our website and this policy at any time. You should check this privacy policy periodically. If our policies regarding collection, storage and use of your information change, the information collected under prior policies will continue to be governed by those policies, unless we obtain your consent to use that information in new ways.

**_You can access your information._**

Upon your request, we will provide you with access to your unique account-related information and information from contacts that we maintain about you. In your request, please provide us with your current specific contact information so that we can accurately check our records.

**_How is my information protected?_**

Your information is password-protected. In order to maintain this protection, we caution you not to provide your password to anyone. We do not give your password to anyone. We recommend that, if you share your computer with other people, you close your browser window when your session is completed.
