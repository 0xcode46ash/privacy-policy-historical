# Privacy Policy â€“ BagsOK

Our use of personal information that you may submit to us through this Web site is governed by our Privacy Policy. We collect personal information directly from you and your transactions with us. We use your information to provide you with our products and services, or respond to your inquiries. We adhere to a strict privacy policy. And hence the mean your information will not be shared, sold, or distributed. We hope you enjoy your stay!

This privacy policy may be changed from time to time, so please check it on a regular basis.

**What personal information do we collect?**

When you place an order with us, we ask for the standard personal information in our order form (such as name, address, email, contact phone number, and so forth) in order to properly ship goods to you. This information is secure in protected systems. If necessary, we may use this information to contact you (via email for example) regarding a pending order, or to answer a question prompted from you.

From time to time, you may receive promotional information and special offers through e-mail or regular mail from Bagsok.com and/or our marketing partners. However, if you do not want to receive e-mail communications or other promotional communications, you are free to opt for moving out of our mail list at any time.

We do not sell, lease, or rent your email address without your permission. From time to time, we make certain third party offers available through our site. If you accept such offer, we will disclose your contact and billing information to that third party, even if you have previously opted to move out from our mail list.

**What other kind of information do we collect?**

We use a commonly known file called a "cookie" on our site. These are the same cookies used on millions of other websites in order to help you navigate our site. We use cookies to let your computer remember the contents (products) in your shopping cart and other related information.

In some cases, we may use a cookie to know if you are coming from a site affiliate so that we may deal with the commissions of that site. In the case of affiliated sites, only the subtotal sale amount will be divulged to the affiliates for payment purposes. Personally identifiable information will in NO WAY be provided outside of Bagsok.com in these cases. Like most other websites, we monitor the aggregate (how many people) traffic statistics on our website. This is done in order to provide our customers with better and more efficient service. These general statistics do NOT personally identify our customers and site visitors.

We use affiliate software to track where potential customers come from so that the affiliate site may be paid as a result. This software logs computer ID as a security precaution.

**Notification of Changes**

This policy may be revised over time as new features are added to Bagsok.com. We will post any such new privacy policies, along with the date of last revision, in prominent positions so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use it, and whether we will disclose it to anyone.
