**You will be prompted frequently with a message asking you to accept a cookie being offered. Most customers find that there is no benefit to turning off cookies.

**8\. How can I be sure my information is safe?  
**We use technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) that encrypts any data transmitted between you and Bags & Bows as long as the Web Browser you're using also supports SSL. All the most popular browsers support SSL in recent versions. 

Encrypted data is much harder to decode than regular data, making it much less attractive to a hacker. Before you actually submit your information to Bags & Bows, your Browser encrypts the data. It remains encrypted during the transmission and then it is decoded by our Web Server when it is received. 

You can be sure that you are on a secure page a couple of ways. In the address bar of your browser which contains our web address you will note that the web address prefix changes from http to https. Also many browsers contain an icon resembling a padlock on the bottom. If this padlock is closed then you are on a secure page. You may also opt to have your browser tell you when you are entering a secure page. Click here to find out how?

In order to use SSL, we had to apply for the privilege to conduct Electronic Commerce and go through a strict approval process to obtain a digital certificate. Our digital certificate was issued by an authorized security service after we proved we were a legitimate business. The digital certificate was then installed on our Web Server so that from now on, we can offer you the security of SSL. We are currently authorized by Verisign, whose seal can be found, on the bottom left of our home page. If you have an further questions regarding security on our site please feel free to contact us at 1-800-822-7026. Back to top of page

**9\. Is there any information that is not safe?  
**We use the SSL technology on all pages that require information to be passed from you to us. There are no pages on our website in which you disclose information about you or your company that are not secure. To learn more about SSL, click here. Back to top of page

**10\. How I tell when I am entering a secure web page?**
