When you access content on the BARBRI Sites, we collect information (i) that you voluntarily provide to us when you register for our services or purchase our products and (ii) that we receive automatically, including personally identifying information such as your (1) personal contact information (e.g., name, home or postal address, e-mail address, phone number (home, mobile, etc.)), (2) educational background (e.g., school, graduation date), (3) educational goals and interests, (4) account login information, (5) demographic information, (6) credit card information, (7) lectures you watch online, (8) test questions you complete, (9) your performance on practice tests, (10) your progress toward full completion of all course assignments, as well as (11) technical computer information, (12) website usage information, and (13) social network information ("personal data"). 

**III. How We Respond to Do Not Track Signals**

Do Not Track is a privacy preference that users can set in some web browsers. When a user turns on the Do Not Track signal, the browser sends a message to websites requesting them not to track the user. 

BARBRI Sites use cookies, tracking pixels and related technologies. Cookies are small data files that are served by our platform and stored on your device. Our site uses cookies dropped by us or third parties for a variety of purposes including to operate and personalize the website. Also, cookies may also be used to track how you use the site to target ads to you on other websites. Our servers may automatically record information when you visit BARBRI Sites. These servers' logs may include information such as your web request and Internet Protocol address. 

We recognize how important your online privacy is to you, so we offer the following option for controlling the targeted ads you receive and how we use your personal data:

You can opt-out of receiving targeted ads served by us or other advertising companies using the NAI opt out tool here, which allows you to opt out of seeing targeted ads from us and from other NAI-approved member companies.

Please note that when using the ad industry opt-out tool described above:

If you opt-out, we may still collect some data about your online activity for operational purposes (such as fraud prevention) but it won't be used by us for the purpose of targeting ads to you. If you use multiple browsers or devices you may need to execute this opt out on each browser or device. 

**IV. How We Store and Protect the Information We Collect**

We maintain your personal data securely in our customer database.

We use reasonable physical and technical safeguards to secure your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. 

We secure the personally identifiable information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure.

When personal information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

We use the information we collect to provide the service or product requested; to enable billing and shipping; to provide you with information about related products and services, based on the preferences you have indicated; to improve our Web site; for development of new products and services; and for systems administration and troubleshooting purposes.

To the extent an educational institution (e.g., your law school) collects and maintains Course Performance Information, that information may be considered an educational record under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA"), 20 USC 1232g. If so, you may have certain rights of access and confidentiality as to those educational records, if any, as a student of that institution.
