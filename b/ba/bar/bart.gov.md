**Privacy at the BART Website**  
Because we receive certain types of information from visitors to the BART website, we want you to understand the terms and conditions regarding the use of that information. The following privacy statement discloses what information we receive and how we use it.

 **What type of information does BART receive at its website?**  
The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. In general, we receive two types of information: The personal information you provide voluntarily, and aggregated information about users as a whole.

 **Personal Information**  
We may request personal information (e.g. when you submit comments, enter a contest or sweepstakes, sign up to receive email notifications, etc.). This personal information may include your name, email address, phone number, street address, etc. If you use BART's online employment application, we may also request other types of personal information required to process your application.

We receive certain types of information about general activity at the BART website. This does not include personal information, but does include how many times the BART website is visited, which pages or search terms are requested most, what domain name visitors are coming from and the date and time of each visit.

For example, it helps us determine things like which areas of the BART website you like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, peak traffic hours, etc. BART may share aggregated information with third parties and include it in public records.
