# BART - About This Site - Privacy Policy

|  **Privacy Policy**

**Privacy at the BART Website**

Because we receive certain types of information from visitors to the BART website, we want you to understand the terms and conditions regarding the use of that information. The following privacy statement discloses what information we receive and how we use it.

**What type of information does BART receive at it's website?**

The information we receive depends upon what you do when visiting this site. In general, we receive two types of information: The personal information you provide voluntarily, and aggregated information about users as a whole.

  * **Personal Information** We may request personal information when you submit comments to BART or register for online contests, sweepstakes or other promotional programs we may offer. This personal information may include your name, email address, phone number, street address, etc. If you use BART's online employment application, we may also request other types of personal information required to process your application.
  * **Aggregated Information** Because of the way Internet computer servers work, we receive certain types of information about general activity at the BART website. This does not include personal identifying information, but does include how many times the BART website is visited, what pages or search terms are requested most, what domain names (e.g. "aol.com") visitors are coming from and the date and time of each visit. BART compiles this information into an aggregate form for statistical analysis and reporting. These reports track website activity overall rather than on an individual level.

**How does BART use this information?**

The personal information you voluntarily provide is used to fulfill your request (e.g. for information, for employment consideration, entry in a contest or sweepstakes, etc.). BART does not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to anyone, or disclose personal information except: 1) When the purpose and manner of the disclosure has been disclosed to you prior to your providing the information, or 2) When disclosure is required by law.

Because aggregated information does not include personal identifying information, we cannot use aggregated information to identify you. We review it for statistical purposes and thereafter delete it from the system. Aggregated information helps us determine things like which areas of the BART website you like and don't like based on traffic to those areas, peak traffic hours, etc. This helps us continue to build a better website for you. We may disclose aggregated data to third parties (such as advertisers) or include it in public records.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a small data file that websites commonly write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file contains information that can identify you anonymously in order to track traffic patterns and add functionality to the website. Cookies don't identify you personally, but rather identify your computer when you visit our site. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites.

Your browser can be set to warn you before accepting cookies. In this case, you will receive the warning message with each cookie. You may choose to refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use the majority of the BART website, but you will need to allow cookies in certain areas of the site to perform certain functions. BART allows users to clear cookies.
