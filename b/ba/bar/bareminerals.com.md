Last updated on August 26, 2008

Our goal at Bare Escentuals is to provide a safe, secure and pleasant shopping experience for our Bare Escentuals customers. Bare Escentuals is committed to protecting your privacy and security as a customer. We only collect information that you give us and WE DO NOT SELL OR RENT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION TO ANYONE. Personal information may be disclosed if required by law.

## When you place an order...

We request your name, email address, mailing address, phone number, credit card number and expiration date. We use this information to process and deliver your order, and to update you on order status as well as to notify you of special offers from Bare Escentuals.

## When you register for an account...

We ask for your name, mailing address, telephone number, email address and password. This data is stored securely, and you don't have to re-enter it with each visit to our website. It's also used to recognize you as a repeat customer so we can personalize your shopping experience.

## When you join our email list...

We request your email address to send you email about our product launches and new services. If you receive an email and wish to be removed from our email list, simply look at the end of the email for instructions on how to remove yourself from the mailing list.

## When you fill out a survey...

We may request demographic information about you (such as your age and occupation) as well information about your interests in our products or other beauty products. These surveys may also ask you for certain personal information (such as your email address) so that we may contact you with information about specific Bare Escentualsâ€™ products that may be of interest to you. Surveys may be administered by third party service providers on our behalf and are generally used by Bare Escentuals to conduct market research and identify product improvement or growth opportunities.
