Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using this website ("the Site"). In this Policy "we", "us" and "our" means Barclays Bank PLC and “you” means the individual who is using the Site. By using our Site, you agree with the collection, the use and the disclosure of your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy. 

We may change the content or services found on the Site at any time without notice, and consequently our Privacy Policy may change at any time in the future. Your continued access to or use of the Site will mean that you agree to the changes. 

Our Privacy Policy, together with the [Important Information](http://www.barclayswealth.com/important-information.htm "Important Information") sets out the basis on which any personal data we collect from you, or that you provide to us, will be processed by us.

## Cookies

**

****To make using our Site as straightforward as possible and to improve the service we offer you, we use cookies.  
 **What are Cookies?**  
Cookies are harmless text files that web servers can store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. There are two main types: 

  * **Transient (or per-session) cookies  
** These only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security. 
  * **Persistent (or permanent) cookies  
** These stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help ensure your hard drive doesn’t get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don’t need to remember membership details.



We use both types of cookie.

Additionally, cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies are owned & created by the website you’re viewing- in this case by Barclays Bank plc. Third party cookies are owned & created by an independent company, usually a company providing a service to the website owners.  In our case, third party cookies provided from this Site are still subject to the provisions set out below.

## What we use cookies for

**

****Internet cookies are common, do not harm your system and do not retrieve information about you stored on your hard drive – they just store or gather site information. They help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don’t have to re-enter them when revisiting a site.

We use cookies to:

1. Gather customer journey information across our sites   
2. Ensure your privacy in our secure sites   
3. Store login details for our secure sites   
4. Temporarily store details input into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations   
5. Store details of your marketing, product and business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites   
6. Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness.   
We use both our own (first party) and partner companies’ (third party) cookies to support these activities. We don’t use cookies to track people’s Internet usage after leaving our sites and we don’t store personal information in them others could read and understand.
