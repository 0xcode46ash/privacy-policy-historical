###  Cookies 

With regards to the new requirements on Cookies following the revision of the e-Privacy Directive, Barclays is working towards implementing the new requirements in line with guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office. 

To make using our Site as straightforward as possible and to improve the service we offer you, we use cookies. 

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are text files that web servers can store on your computer's hard drive when you visit a website. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. There are two main types: 

  * **Transient (or per-session) cookies**  
These only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security. 
  * **Persistent (or permanent) cookies**  
These stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help ensure your hard drive doesn't get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don't need to remember membership details. 



We use both types of cookie. 

Additionally, cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies are owned & created by the website you're viewing- in this case by Barclays Bank plc. Third party cookies are owned & created by an independent company, usually a company providing a service to the website owners. In our case, third party cookies provided from this Site are still subject to the provisions set out below. 

**What we use cookies for**

Internet cookies help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don't have to re-enter them when revisiting a site. 

We use cookies to: 

  1. Gather customer journey information across our sites 
  2. Ensure your privacy in our secure sites 
  3. Store login details for our secure sites 
  4. Temporarily store details input into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations 
  5. Store details of your marketing, product and business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites 
  6. Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness. 



We use both our own (first party) and partner companies' (third party) cookies to support these activities. 

We don't use cookies to track people's Internet usage after leaving our sites. 

**Services requiring enabled cookies**

Some of our services require cookies in your browser to view and use them and to protect your financial and personal information. 

**Changing your cookie settings**

You are not obliged to accept cookies that we send to you and you can in fact modify your browser so that it will not accept cookies. To enable or disable cookies, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the "Help", "Tools" or "Edit" facility). Alternatively, an [external resource](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/ "Information about cookies") is available, providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them to suit your preferences. 

Please note that should you choose to set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of this Site, for example any online accounts you may hold. 

**Other information relating to your computer**

We may collect information about your computer, including where available your IP address, operating system and browser type, for system administration and to report aggregate information to our advertisers. This information is statistical data about our Site users' browsing actions and patterns. 

**Secure online services**

Any secure online services you subscribe to with us may use cookies to enable information about you and your preferences to be stored and to prevent unauthorised access to your services and information. Cookies must usually be accepted in such circumstances - without them we cannot ensure your information is secure (and people rejecting cookies can't use the services).

###  How will we use the information we collect about you? 

We will store and process your information on the Barclays Group computers wherever located (including outside the European Economic Area (EEA)) and in any other medium. By "your information" we mean personal and financial information we:  
(a) obtain from you or from third parties and other organisations when you apply for an account or any other product or service for which you or they give to us at any other time; or  
(b) learn from the way you use and manage your account(s), from the transactions made, if any, such as the date, amount, currency and the name and type of supplier (e.g. supermarket services, medical services, retail services). 

By "Barclays Group" we mean subsidiaries of Barclays Bank PLC (as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985). We and other companies in the Barclays Group will use your information to manage your account(s), give you statements and provide our services, for assessment and analysis (including credit and/or behaviour scoring, market and product analysis), to identify and tackle fraud, money laundering and other crime, carry out regulatory checks and meet our obligations to any relevant regulatory authority, and to develop and improve our services to you and other customers and protect our interests. 

We and other members of the Barclays Group may use your information for marketing purposes. If you don't want us to tell you about other products and services, please write to us and supply us with your full name and address and details of any products or services you have with us. Please write to your normal point of contact, or your Relationship Manager. Alternatively, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us.htm "Contact us").

###  Will we share your information with anyone else? 

We may share your information including how you manage your account or Site visit with other companies within the Barclays Group and/or to relevant third parties and as permitted by law including but not limited to the following: 

  * People who provide a service to us or are acting as our agents, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential. 
  * Anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer all or any part of our business or assets, from whom we acquire any business or assets or who acquires substantially all of the assets of Barclays Bank PLC. 
  * Credit reference and fraud prevention agencies. 
  * We may also give out information about you if we have a duty to do so in order to comply with any legal obligation, or in order to enforce or apply our [terms of use](https://web.archive.org/important-information.htm "Important Information") or if the law allows us to do so. 



If we disclose your information to a service provider (a person, office or organisation) located in another country (including locations outside of the European Economic Area), we will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that they apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to your information and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us. By submitting your personal information you agree to this transfer.
