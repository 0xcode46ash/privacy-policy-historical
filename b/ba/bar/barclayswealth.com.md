###  Cookies 

**What is a cookie?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information, which your computer or mobile device downloads when you visit a website. When you return to these websites – or visit other websites that use the same cookies – they recognise these cookies and therefore your browsing device.  
Cookies help websites to do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences and generally improving your browsing experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. 

**What types of cookies do we use?**

The type of cookies used on this website can be put into one of four categories based on the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) guide for cookie categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance, Functionality and Targeting. 

**Strictly Necessary Cookies** – These cookies are essential in order to enable you to navigate our websites and to access secure content. Without these cookies, services you have asked for, such as internet banking facilities, cannot be provided. These cookies don’t gather information about you for profiling or targeted marketing purposes. 

This category cannot be disabled using the cookies preference selection on this website. 

**Performance Cookies** – These cookies collect anonymous information about how visitors use our websites, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t collect personally identifiable information; the information collected is anonymous and is only used to improve the performance of our websites. 

These cookies are not used to target you with online advertising and without these cookies we cannot learn how our website is performing, and make relevant enhancements that could help improve your experience when using our online services. 

**Functionality Cookies** – These cookies allow our websites to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you're in) and tailor the website to provide enhanced features and content for you. These cookies can also be used to remember customisation changes that you may make (for example text size or fonts). They may also be used to provide services you asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect is anonymous and cannot be used to track your browsing activity on other websites. 

Without these cookies, a website cannot remember choices you've previously made or personalise your browsing experience. 

**Targeting Cookies** – These cookies gather information about your browsing habits. They remember that you've visited a website and share this information with other organisations such as advertisers. They do this in order to provide you with adverts that are more relevant to you and your interests. Although these cookies can track your visits to other websites, they don’t usually know who you are. 

Disabling these cookies will not stop online adverts from being displayed to you. However without these cookies, online adverts you encounter may be less relevant to you and your interests. 

**Setting your cookie preferences**

You can control how cookies are placed on your device either through the ‘Cookies’ link near the bottom of the page or from within your browser. 

**What happens to cookies that have been downloaded in the past?**

Once you've disabled a cookie category we'll stop using the associated cookies to gather any further information but we may still use information collected previously. You can delete existing cookies from your browser.

###  How will we use the information we collect about you? 

We will store and process your information on the Barclays Group computers wherever located (including outside the European Economic Area (EEA)) and in any other medium. By "your information" we mean personal and financial information we:  
(a) obtain from you or from third parties and other organisations when you apply for an account or any other product or service for which you or they give to us at any other time; or  
(b) learn from the way you use and manage your account(s), from the transactions made, if any, such as the date, amount, currency and the name and type of supplier (e.g. supermarket services, medical services, retail services). 

By "Barclays Group" we mean subsidiaries of Barclays Bank PLC (as defined in section 736 of the UK Companies Act 1985). We and other companies in the Barclays Group will use your information to manage your account(s), give you statements and provide our services, for assessment and analysis (including credit and/or behaviour scoring, market and product analysis), to identify and tackle fraud, money laundering and other crime, carry out regulatory checks and meet our obligations to any relevant regulatory authority, and to develop and improve our services to you and other customers and protect our interests. 

We and other members of the Barclays Group may use your information for marketing purposes. If you don't want us to tell you about other products and services, please write to us and supply us with your full name and address and details of any products or services you have with us. Please write to your normal point of contact, or your Relationship Manager. Alternatively, [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us.htm "Contact us").

If we disclose your information to a service provider (a person, office or organisation) located in another country (including locations outside of the European Economic Area), we will take steps reasonably necessary to ensure that they apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to your information and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.
