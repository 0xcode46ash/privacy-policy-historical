# :: Privacy Policy :: Barclays Wealth

Please read our Privacy Policy carefully before using this website ("the Site"). In this Policy "we", "us" and "our" means Barclays Bank PLC and “you” means the individual who is using the Site. 

**Cookies**  
To make using our website as straightforward as possible and to improve the service we offer you, we use cookies. 

**What are Cookies?**  
Cookies are harmless text files that web servers can store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a site. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit. There are two main types: 

  * **Transient (or per-session) cookies** \- these only exist for your site visit and are deleted on exit. They recognise you as you move between pages, for example, recording items added to an online shopping basket. These cookies also help maintain security.

  * **Persistent (or permanent) cookies** \- these stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many are built with automatic deletion dates to help ensure your hard drive doesn’t get overloaded. These cookies often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don’t need to remember membership details.




We use both types of cookie. 

Additionally, cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies are owned & created by the website you’re viewing. Third party cookies are owned & created by an independent company, usually a company providing a service to the website owners.

**What we use cookies for**  
Internet cookies are common and do not harm your system – they just store or gather site information. They help you do things online, like remembering logon details so you don’t have to re-enter them when revisiting a site. 

We use cookies to: 

  1. Gather customer journey information across our sites 
  2. Ensure your privacy in our secure sites 
  3. Store login details for our secure sites 
  4. Temporarily store details input into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations 
  5. Store details of your marketing, product and business unit preferences to improve our targeting and enhance your journey through our sites 
  6. Evaluate our sites' advertising and promotional effectiveness (we own the anonymous data collected, which is not shared with anyone).   




We use both our own (first party) and partner companies’ (third party) cookies to support these activities. We don’t use cookies to track people’s Internet usage after leaving our sites and we don’t store personal information in them others could read and understand. We will not sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent. 

**Services requiring enabled cookies  
** Some of our services, including by Barclays Bank PLC, require cookies in your browser to view and use them and to protect your financial and personal information.   


**Changing your cookie settings  
** To enable or disable cookies, follow the instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the “Help”, “Tools” or “Edit” facility).  Alternatively, an external resource is available at [www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies) providing specific information about cookies and how to manage them to suit your preferences.

Please note that should you choose to set your browser to disable cookies, you may not be able to access secure areas of this Site, for example any online accounts you may hold.

  **Secure online services  
** Any secure online services you subscribe to with us may use cookies to enable information about you and your preferences to be stored and to prevent unauthorised access to your services and information.  Cookies must usually be accepted in such circumstances - without them we cannot ensure your information is secure (and people rejecting cookies can’t use the services). 

We reserve the right to use other tracking technologies in the future.

**More information  
** To learn more about the nature of cookies, please read: <http://www.barclays.com/privacy/what.html>

**How will we use the information we collect about you?**

We will store and process your information on the Barclays Group computers wherever located and in any other medium.  By "your information" we mean personal and financial information we:  


> (a)  obtain from you or from third parties and other organisations when you apply for an account or any other product or service for which you or they give to us at any other time; or   
> (b)  learn from the way you use and manage your account(s), from the transactions made, if any, such as the date, amount, currency and the name and type of supplier (e.g. supermarket services, medical services, retail services). 

By “Barclays Group” we mean subsidiaries of Barclays Bank PLC.  We and other companies in the Barclays Group will use your information to manage your account(s), give you statements and provide our services, for assessment and analysis (including credit and/or behaviour scoring, market and product analysis), to identify and tackle fraud, money laundering and other crime, carry out regulatory checks and meet our obligations to any relevant regulatory authority, and to develop and improve our services to you and other customers and protect our interests. 

We and other members of the Barclays Group will use your information to inform you by letter, telephone, text (or similar) messages, digital television, e mail and other electronic methods about products and services (including those of others) which may be of interest to you.

If you don't want us to tell you about other products and services please write to us and supply us with your full name and address and details of any products or services you have with us.  Please write to us at Barclays Wealth, Tay House, 300 Bath Street, Glasgow, United Kingdom  G2 4LH.

**Will we share your information with anyone else?**

We will share your information including how you manage your account or Site visit with other companies within the Barclays Group, to relevant third parties and as permitted by law including but not limited to the following: 

> • People who provide a service to us or are acting as our agents, on the understanding that they will keep the information confidential.   
> • Anyone to whom we transfer or may transfer our rights and duties under this arrangement.   
> • We may also give out information about you if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to do so. 

Otherwise we will keep information about you confidential. 

If we disclose your information to a service provider (a person, office or organisation located in another country), we will make sure that they apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to your information and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.

**How long will we keep your personal information on file?**

We will retain information about you after the closure of your account or service provision for as long as it is permitted for legal, regulatory, fraud prevention, business and financial crime purposes or for as long as the law allows us to do so.

Under the applicable data protection legislation you may be entitled, on payment of a fee, to a copy of the personal information you have provided.  If any data is inaccurate it will be corrected without delay.  Please write to us at Barclays Wealth, Tay House, 300 Bath Street, Glasgow, United Kingdom  G2 4LH.

**Electronic communications**

Please remember that Internet communications are not secure unless the data being sent is encrypted. We cannot accept any responsibility for the unauthorised access by a third party and/or the corruption of data being sent by individuals to the Barclays Group.  Some countries prohibit transmission of encrypted data over telephone lines. You should not encrypt data transmitted if you know doing so would contravene applicable local, national or international laws.  For guidance relating to your specific situation, please contact your legal adviser.

It has always been our policy that if any of our Clients are victims of unauthorised access to their accounts we will cover any resulting financial loss which the Client suffers provided that the Client has not breached our security procedures.   
You must ensure that viruses do not enter your computer system. We assume no responsibility in this respect.
