**_Surveys and Promotions._** From time-to-time we may request information from you via surveys, or sweepstakes, contests, and other promotions (a “Promotion”).

**_Portable or Mobile Devices/Location Information._** We may collect additional information from you if you access Services through a mobile or portable device, for example your unique device identifier, device’s operating system, mobile carrier, language, locale, or regional location, and geo location but solely for anti-fraud or other internal, non-marketing purposes. We may also use this data internally or in conjunction with our third-party service providers or platforms to customize your experience and provide offers that may be relevant to you.. However the degree to which your location can be identified depends on the device you are using (e.g. laptop, smartphone, tablet) and how you are connected to the internet (e.g. via cable broadband connection, WiFi, etc.). We may also collect your location information from your IP address or zip code.

Please be advised that some features will not be available if you choose not to provide your location data to us.

 ** _Information Collected Through Technology._** In addition to any Personal Information or other information that you choose to submit to us, we and our third-party service providers may use a variety of technologies that automatically (or passively) collect certain information whenever you visit or interact with the Services. This may include the browser that you are using, the URL that referred you to the Services, all of the areas within the Services that you visit, and the time of day, among other information ("Usage Information"). We may use the Usage Information for a variety of purposes, including to enhance, or otherwise improve the Services. We also use this information to prepare aggregated reports, which we may share with third parties. In addition, we collect your IP address or other unique identifier for your computer or other device used to access the Services. A device identifier is a number that is automatically assigned to the device used to access the Services and our computers identify your device by its device identifier. Usage Information may be non-identifying or may be associated with you. Usage Information collected from your interaction with our Services may be combined with personal information collected from other sources. For example, we may passively collect your geolocation information solely to confirm your address for shipping or to help prevent fraudulent activity. Whenever we associate Usage Information or a device identifier with personally identifiable information, we will treat it as Personal Information. We often use third parties’ analytic tools to collect Usage Information. 

We and third party vendors, including Google, also use first-party cookies (such as Google Analytics) to report how our ad impressions, and interactions with these ad impressions, are related to visits to the Services.

These companies (and the advertisers themselves) may use tracking technologies (for example, third party cookies) to collect and use interest based or behavioral information about your visits on our Services and other websites in order to provide targeted advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. They may also use tracking technologies to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize advertising content.

### EXAMPLES OF TRACKING TOOLS

**Cookies**

A cookie is a data file placed on a device when the device is used to visit the Services. We use cookies to collect information for record-keeping purposes and to make it easier to navigate the Services. Cookies are stored on users’ hard drives. We use both “session ID cookies” and “persistent cookies.” Session ID cookies are used to store information while a user is logged into the Services and expire when the user closes his/her browser. Persistent cookies are used to make tasks like logging into the Services easier for returning users by remembering a user’s login information. Persistent cookies stay on a user’s hard drive from one session to the next. Flash cookies, known as local shared objects, are data files placed on a device via the Adobe Flash plug-in that may be built in or downloaded by you to your device to personalize your visit. Our third-party service providers also may use Flash cookies to collect and store information. Flash cookies are different from standard browser cookies because of the amount, type, and storage method. Cookies may be used for many purposes including, without limitation, remembering you and your preferences and tracking your visits to our web pages. You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a persistent or session cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off such cookies through your browser settings. Every browser is a little different, so refer to your browser’s Help menu for the correct way to modify your cookies. However, cookie management tools provided by your browser will not remove Flash cookies. If you choose to disable cookies on your device, some features of the Services may not function properly. 

**Web Beacons/GIFS**

Small graphic images or other web programming code called web beacons (also known as “1×1 GIFs” or “clear GIFs”) may be included in our web pages and messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image or other web programming code inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. Web beacons or similar technologies may be used for a number of purposes including, without limitation, to count visitors to our Services, to monitor how users navigate the Services, to count how many sent e-mails were actually opened, or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed. 

**Embedded Scripts**

An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Services, such as the links you click on. The code downloads temporarily onto the device you use to access Services from our web server or third-party service provider. It is active only while you are connected to the Services, and is deactivated or deleted after that.

**HTML 5**

We may use HTML5 in some of our Services, including in our mobile website. HTML5 has browser web storage that does not rely on traditional browser cookies. Like Flash cookies, HTML5 cookies are not stored in a browser “cookies” file and, like Flash cookies, can be used to track users across websites. To our knowledge, there is currently no known way for a user of a mobile device to remove HTML5 tracking and storage.

**E-tags/cache browsers/web logs**

Like most standard website servers, we log IP addresses (a unique number assigned to every computer on the Internet) and device identifier to improve security, analyze trends, and administer the Services. We may track your movement within the Services, the pages from which you were referred, access times, and browser types. This information may include the browser you are using, the Internet address from which you linked to our Services, the operating system of your computer, the unique IP address of the computer or device identifier of the mobile device that you used to access our Services, and usage and browsing habits. We use this information in the aggregate to gauge the effectiveness, usage, and popularity of our Services, track information for statistical purposes, help diagnose and troubleshoot server malfunctions, analyze trends, track user movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information. We may also use individual information we collect through web logs to send you targeted offers and other communications. 

**Device Fingerprinting**

We may use device fingerprinting in some of our Services, which allows us to collect information about a remote computing device for the purpose of identification. It can be used to prevent fraud or collect information about you. 

**IDFA**

The IDFA is a device identifier that is used by many software kit developers for various reasons including to measure user behavior in mobile apps. Additionally, the IDFA is the shared identifier between an ad network and an ad server to report which networks delivered a particular download.
