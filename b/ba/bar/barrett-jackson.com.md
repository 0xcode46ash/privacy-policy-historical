## Collection of Information

## Registration and Use of Information

No user is required to provide information in order to visit Barrett-Jackson's site. However, a user must register in order to be placed on Barrett-Jackson's Email News Service list. In addition, a user must register to enter contests and other promotions. During registration, a user provides certain categories of information, such as name, address, email address, date of birth, and information regarding that user's purchase of Barrett-Jackson merchandise or services. The information which you supply to Barrett-Jackson enables us to customize our site to your interests and enhance your overall experience at our site. In addition, it helps us communicate with you about Barrett-Jackson news and events. Besides sending you the Barrett-Jackson Email News, Barrett-Jackson may use your contact information periodically in order to send you email regarding upcoming Barrett-Jackson events and promotions. In addition, we may request information for other specific purposes. If the information provided will be used in any way that differs from the treatment outlined in this Privacy Policy, we will identify the differences when we request the information.

We use the personal information you provide for internal purposes, such as confirming and tracking orders placed online, subscription or registration for special promotions, analyzing trends and statistics, informing you of our new products, services and offers, and providing you with information from and about Barrett-Jackson. From time to time we might establish a business relationship with other persons or entities whom we believe trustworthy and whom we have asked to confirm that their privacy policies are consistent with ours. These are known as our “Select Partners.” In such cases we might share and cross–reference information, including personal information about you that will enable Select Partners to contact you regarding products and services that may be of interest to you.

To serve you better, we may combine information you give us online, at our events or through other correspondence with us. We may also combine that information with publicly available information and information we receive from or cross–reference with our Select Partners and others. We use that combined information to enhance and personalize your experiences with us, to communicate with you about our products and events that may be of interest to you, and for other promotional purposes.

If, at any time, you are receiving information from Barrett-Jackson or its Select Partners that you no longer wish to receive, you may contact us to opt out and to request that your name be removed from a contact list. We pledge to honor all such requests and to affirm that our Select Partners do so as well.

## Third Party Links and Use of Information

The Barrett-Jackson site contains links to sites operated by third parties. These sites may collect personally identifiable information about you. For example, Barrett-Jackson participates in the Google AdSense program and the interest-based advertising program offered by Google. Google, as a third party vendor, uses cookies to service visitors to the Barrett-Jackson site. In particular, Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to Barrett-Jackson’s site visitors based on their visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Information transmitted does not include your name, address, email address, or telephone number. Visitors to Barrett-Jackson’s site may opt out of the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network privacy policy page at this [link](http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/).

## Passive Collection of Information

In addition to the information that you actively provide to Barrett-Jackson, such as what you provide when you register for Barrett-Jackson's Email News Service, Barrett-Jackson collects information about how you interact with our site. Barrett-Jackson collects passive information for purposes such as testing and improving a user's experience at the site and for compiling broad aggregate demographic data and related usage data for Barrett-Jackson's internal purposes. The types of passive information include, but are not limited to, your IP address, which type of browser you are using, where you go on our site and how long you stay on any part of our site. We may also track how you interact with our site, by assigning a random string of numbers and characters to your session. Passive information does not identify you to Barrett-Jackson by name, and Barrett-Jackson does not link your IP address to your personally identifiable information.

We use a "cookie" based data collection paradigm in certain areas of our site. Cookies are small files placed on your hard drive that assist us in providing customized services; for example, the use of cookies allows us to reduce the frequency with which you will need to enter your password on password-protected areas of our site. Additionally, in some cases, certain functionalities are only feasible through the use of a cookie. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features on our site and/or you may be required to re-enter your password more frequently during a session.
