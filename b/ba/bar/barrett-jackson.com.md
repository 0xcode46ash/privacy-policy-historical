This Privacy Policy applies to information we collect when you use our websites, mobile apps and other online services, including any Wi-Fi service we make available at our events (collectively, “Services”) or when you otherwise interact with us, including when you register for or attend one of our events, transact business at our Showroom, or when you contact us for customer support. We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make changes, we will notify you by revising the date at the top of the policy and, in some cases, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our homepage or sending you an email). For information about choices we provide in connection with our information practices, please see the “Your Choices” section below.

Advertising and Analytics Services Provided by Others 

We allow others to provide analytics services and serve advertisements on our behalf across the Internet and in mobile apps. These entities may use cookies, web beacons, device identifiers and other technologies to collect information about your use of our websites and mobile apps and other websites and apps, including your IP address, web browser, mobile network information, pages viewed, time spent on pages or in apps, links clicked and conversion information. This information may be used by Barrett-Jackson and others to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, deliver advertising and content targeted to your interests on our websites and mobile apps and other websites and apps, and better understand your online activity. For more information about interest-based ads, or to learn how you may be able to opt out of having your web browsing information used for behavioral advertising purposes, please visit [www.aboutads.info/choices](https://web.archive.org/web/20181228172213id_/https%3A//www.barrett-jackson.com/Policies/Home/www.aboutads.info/choices). Your mobile device may also include a feature that allows you to opt out of having certain information collected through apps used for behavioral advertising purposes.

**Account Information**  
You may update the online account information you provide to us by logging into your online account. 

**Cookies**  
Most web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove or reject browser cookies. Please note that if you choose to remove or reject cookies, this could affect the availability and functionality of our websites. 

**Promotional Communications**  
You may opt out of receiving promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as those about your account or our ongoing business relations. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
California law permits residents of California to request certain details about how their information is shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes. Under the law, a business must either provide this information or permit California residents to opt in to, or opt out of, this type of sharing. We provide the ability to opt out of this type of sharing. To opt out of having information about you shared with third parties for direct marketing purposes, please submit your request to us through the information listed in the “Contact Us” section below. 

**Event Location Information**  
Please contact us at: [information@barrett-jackson.com](mailto:information@barrett-jackson.com) if you want to opt out of our collection of location information when you attend an event. We will need you to provide us with your device MAC address to facilitate this opt out. This opt out will only work for each unique MAC address, so you will need to opt out for each device you bring to an event. And any device that periodically resets its MAC address will be treated as a new device that requires a new opt-out. Keep in mind, you can also turn off all WiFi and Bluetooth signals to avoid collection of this information. 

**RFID Tags**  
If you are attending one of our events and are provided a credential for access to restricted areas at the event, you may request to receive a credential that does not contain an RFID tag. Please submit your request to us prior to attending the event through the information listed in the “Contact Us” section below. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at: Barrett-Jackson Legal Department, 7400 E. Monte Cristo Avenue, Scottsdale, AZ 85260, or [information@barrett-jackson.com](mailto:information@barrett-jackson.com) or 480.421.6694.
