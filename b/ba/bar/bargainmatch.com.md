# Privacy Policy for BargainMatch.com

[](http://www.bargainmatch.com/) |  |   |    
---|---|---|---  
|    
  


This statement discloses the privacy practices for BargainMatch.com and the BargainMatch Toolbar. Our goal is to provide product descriptions, prices, and reviews from thousands of our partner merchants in an easy-to-use format. 

**What Personally Identifiable Information of yours is collected?**

When you visit BargainMatch.com, you may be asked to provide certain information about yourself (e.g., contact and demographic information), including when you download the BargainMatch Toolbar or contribute product review information. We use this information to learn more about you, so we can provide you with the relevant product content and information most attuned to your interests. You must be at least 13 years of age to download the Bargain Match Toolbar. 

Usage of the BargainMatch Toolbar does not collect, store, track, or communicate your personally identifiable information. Your web usage is totally anonymous. The application only response to our services when you shop on a partner merchant store what has live coupon inventory in our database or when you reach a product page where such product is also sold by a partner merchant. 

**COOKIES**

To enable many of the features available at BargainMatch.com, we assign "cookies" to your Internet browser. A cookie is a small text file that contains a unique identification number stored on your computer. Cookies by themselves cannot be used to find out the identity of any user. This unique identification number automatically identifies your browser - but not you - to our computers whenever you interact with BargainMatch.com. Only when you agree to provide personally identifiable information directly to BargainMatch.com through our registration form will we be able to know anything about you other than the random number that our server computers originally assign to your browser. 

BargainMatch.com uses "cookie" technology to make your visits more convenient for you. We use cookies to give you the option of saving your email address so you don't have to enter it repeatedly when you are entering different sweepstakes and contest offered on BargainMatch.com and to identify where you came from and if you've been to BargainMatch.com before. These are set so we may better customize your experience on BargainMatch.com for your future visits. You are free to reject or "Not Accept" the placement of some or all of our cookies, but you will not be able to auto-enter your email address, participate in our instant win games or customize your future visits. 

There is a lot of confusion about cookies, how they are used, and what they can do. Cookies only contain information that the server computer "knew" in the first place, and can only be read by the serving domain that placed them. For instance, if XYZ.com (a fictitious company) utilizes cookies, BargainMatch.com's servers can't read their contents nor can XYZ.com's servers read ours. Cookies are an essential part of how the Internet works today, and allow server computers to recognize your computer's browser when you return. If you have ever visited a Web page that automatically provides personalized content without you having to "sign in," such as your own stock portfolio, this is almost certainly being accomplished with a cookie. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot "run" on your computer and have no ability to search your computer for other information, or transmit it to anyone.

The data you provide to BargainMatch.com is collected by Litmus Media, Inc. BargainMatch.com is a web site owned and operated by Litmus Media, Inc.

By agreeing to these terms, you hereby consent to disclosure of any record or communication to any third party when BargainMatch.com, in its sole discretion, determines the disclosure to be appropriate.
