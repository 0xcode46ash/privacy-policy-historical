## What are cookies?

Cookies are small files which are stored on your computer. They are designed to hold a modest amount of data specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer. This allows us to deliver a page tailored for you, or the page itself can contain some script which is aware of the data in the cookie and so is able to carry information from one visit to the website (or related site) to the next.

If cookies aren't enabled on your computer, it will mean that your shopping experience on our website will be limited to browsing and researching; you won't be able to add products to your basket and buy them.

  


## Why are we explaining all this?

The European Union passed the 'Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive' which states that websites must provide clear information about how they use cookies and give users means to not have cookies saved on their computer unless they are strictly necessary for the functioning of the website.

  


## So how do we use cookies?

When you visit our website, we will place a session cookie called 'JSESSIONID' on your computer which enables the shopping basket and other core functions of the website to function correctly along with WC_SESSION_ESTABLISHED, WC_ACTIVEPOINTER, WC_AUTHENTICATION_, WC_USERACTIVITY, We feel these cookies are strictly necessary for the website to function fully, without them the website doesn't work properly.

We use Coremetrics to monitor our website. You may see cookies 'cmRS', 'cmTPSet', '90223163_clogin' or '90223163_clogin' from our website. This software helps us take and analyse visitor information such as browser usage, new visitor numbers, response to marketing activity and shopping times. That information helps us to improve the website and your shopping experience, and to make our marketing campaigns relevant.

We use Google Analytics to monitor our websites. Google Analytics aggregates information which means that you can not be identified individually but we can see, for example, which categories of shoes on the website are the most popular or if there is a problem with the basket or checkout process. Google Analytics will place a small number of cookies on your computer with expiry dates ranging from half an hour to 18 months - all these cookies will begin "__utm" and will be from our website. 

If you'd like to learn more about cookies in general and how to manage them, visit aboutcookies.org (opens in a new window).

Barratts is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. We believe it is important for you to know what information we collect and how we treat the information you share with us. The following policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our website and its features. 'Personal Information' includes your name, physical address, e-mail address(es), telephone numbers, credit card information and other similar information that you provide to us. We do not sell your Personal Information.

In the instance above, we may ask for your Personal Information in order to provide you the services or offers. In the case of actions listed above, you will be able to 'unsubscribe' to these at any time. It is completely optional for you to register, participate or otherwise provide us with Personal Information in the above situations.

  


## How Your Information is Used

Barratts will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. If you have opted-in we may use your Personal Information to respond to specific requests and to send notices of new products, special offers and other marketing materials to enhance and support your relationship with Barratts.

## Unsubscribing and Data Removal

If your Personal Information changes (such as post code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if you no longer desire to be contacted about our products and services, you can correct, update or delete/deactivate your Personal Information at any time. This can be done by e-mailing Barratts. If you have previously unsubscribed or opted-out through the Barratts website but you are still receiving notices, offers or solicitation relating to Barratts, it could be that you initially opted-in to receive information in a manner other than through our website (such as a collection and drawing of business cards held at a Barratts retailer units in which the winner is contacted by e-mail). If this is the case, your desire to unsubscribe may also need to be communicated to the original 'opt-in' source. We take your online privacy very seriously, so if you need any assistance in unsubscribing to future communications please contact Barratts. We will promptly take action to ensure that you are 'opted-out' from receiving any further mailing or other information. Although we will remove your name from our e-mail list as quickly as possible, please recognise that there may be a period of time after you unsubscribe during which you may still receive e-mails from us.
