# Welcome - Barratts Shoes

Barratts is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. We believe it is important for you to know what information we collect and how we treat the information you share with us. The following policy will explain how your personal information will be treated as you use our website and its features. 'Personal Information' includes your name, physical address, e-mail address(es), telephone numbers, credit card information and other similar information that you provide to us. We do not sell your Personal Information.

In the instance above, we may ask for your Personal Information in order to provide you the services or offers. In the case of actions listed above, you will be able to 'unsubscribe' to these at any time. It is completely optional for you to register, participate or otherwise provide us with Personal Information in the above situations.

  


## How Your Information is Used

The information you provide helps Barratts understand how you use our website. This allows us to recognise your needs and continue to make the improvements that are important to you and our customers.

Barratts will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. If you have opted-in we may use your Personal Information to respond to specific requests and to send notices of new products, special offers and other marketing materials to enhance and support your relationship with Barratts. These communications may take the form of postal mail, telephone calls, e-mail and other methods of contact. Also, agents, service providers and other contractors of Barratts who will have access to your Personal Information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to fulfil the services they are performing for Barratts.

Additionally, if you have opted-in to receiving marketing or other information from our third party business partners, you may receive marketing or other communications directly from those third parties. Barratts encourages you to read the privacy policies of each and every third party company and website that collects your Personal Information. However, whether you are receiving mailings directly from us or from our third party business partners, you will be able to 'unsubscribe' to these mailings at any time.

  


## Unsubscribing and Data Removal

If your Personal Information changes (such as post code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if you no longer desire to be contacted about our products and services, you can correct, update or delete/deactivate your Personal Information at any time. This can be done by e-mailing Barratts. If you have previously unsubscribed or opted-out through the Barratts website but you are still receiving notices, offers or solicitation relating to Barratts, it could be that you initially opted-in to receive information in a manner other than through our website (such as a collection and drawing of business cards held at a Barratts retailer units in which the winner is contacted by e-mail). If this is the case, your desire to unsubscribe may also need to be communicated to the original 'opt-in' source. We take your online privacy very seriously, so if you need any assistance in unsubscribing to future communications please contact Barratts. We will promptly take action to ensure that you are 'opted-out' from receiving any further mailing or other information. Although we will remove your name from our e-mail list as quickly as possible, please recognise that there may be a period of time after you unsubscribe during which you may still receive e-mails from us.
