****Privacy Policy****

**Information We Collect**  
Go and Connect is a network of websites that correspond to different cities and services worldwide. For full access to our services, you will need to register and create a User Profile by using our online registration form, where you will be required to provide us with your contact information (e.g. e-mail address) and some other information relating to your identity, such as name, date of birth, country of origin etc. Every user can select whether they wants certain data to be available to other network users, such as their email address or date of birth. This information is then made available to other signed-in users within the Go and Connect network. Children are not eligible to use our services and we ask that minors (under 18 years of age) do not submit any personal information to us. In addition, we use cookies on certain pages of our site. Cookies are stored on your hard drive when using the Go and Connect website to allow the user to interact correctly with the website. They may also be used for statistical purposes and to send you new information about any of the Go and Connect websites. If you don’t want to receive new information or the Go and Connect monthly newsletter you can easily change your email preferences when going to ‘My Profile’. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use several sections of the websites which require signing in, as the Service doesn’t recognize you as a member of Go and Connect. 

**Our Use of Your Information**

In the event of the merging or acquisition of Go and Connect, user information or any part of it will be disclosed to the new company. However, the Privacy Policy as detailed above will remain intact. If you have questions or suggestions, please complete a feedback form on the Contact Us section.

****Refund Policy** **

Due to the fact that magazine adverts can not be modified once they have been submitted for publication, or once they have been uploaded to the website, GO and Connect does not offer the possibility of refunds. If the Go and Connect team believes that the advert content is inappropriate for the magazine or website, the full amount of money will be refunded to the client before being submitted for publication on the web or in the magazine. All Go and Connect readers have the option of receiving a yearly subscription to the Go and Connect magazine for a small fee. Once a payment has been made by credit card or bank-transfer, a subscriber can decide tot cancel their subscription and the full amount will be refunded. After the seven day period has expired the subscription can not be cancelled. No refunds will be offered for temporary or permanent loss of Service howsoever arising, including but not limited to a loss of Service due to the Go and Connect website being unavailable for whatever reason. Go and Connect does not take any responsibility for monetary transactions at all.
