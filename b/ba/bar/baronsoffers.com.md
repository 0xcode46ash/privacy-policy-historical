# Privacy Policy | Barons Media

BaronsMedia.com LLC. is an online advertising network. Barons provides high quality, exclusively sourced, and performing video and web ad inventory to advertisers, agencies and ad networks on a fully transparent basis.

### Data Collected

**Cookies** and  
**pixels** provide us with the ability to anonymously identify the machine including:

  * The URLs of web pages which have been viewed
  * The date and time of visit
  * Whether the user has clicked on an ad of one of our Advertisers, visited their website, or undertaken a transaction with them



**Session information** relates to user, campaign and interest-based history and is used for frequency capping and interest targeting. This information is gathered from websites visited and clicks registered by the user’s machine. Information passed  
to us by the user’s computer browser with every request and is stored entirely anonymously for statistical purposes only:

  * IP (Internet Protocol) addresses
  * Browser type
  * Computer Operating System



We do not collect any personally identifiable information. All of the information collected relate to a computer rather than a user.

### Cookies and Pixels

Cookies are small text files that are stored within a folder on your computer and are used only by your Internet browser. They are not programs or applications – they are merely a marker of our previous contact with you. They take up a tiny amount of  
space on your computer (less than a regular webpage without images does) and can be used to uniquely, but anonymously, identify your computer. Most websites use cookies to identify users and improve the user experience. The BaronsMedia.com LLC. cookie  
does not harm your computer in any way or provide us with any information about your identity. The BaronsMedia.com LLC. cookie is not spyware or adware. The general definition of spyware/adware is that of a software package installed on your computer  
for purposes of monitoring all your internet or general computer activity. We do not install software of any kind on your computer and have no ability to monitor or track your general computer or overall internet usage. Cookies can be easily avoided  
by opting out from them, or adjusting your browser settings. Pixels are small text files used to track website visitation and actions taken by users on these websites. The information collected from the pixel is stored in the cookie.

### How Data is used

BaronsMedia.com LLC uses the information collected to target advertising campaigns more effectively. The aim is for you to see ads which you are more likely to be interested in, rather than ads that you aren’t. We do this by comparing the information  
relating to the machine’s anonymous profile, against our selection of ad campaigns and choosing the most suitable advertisement. BaronsMedia.com LLC. can only create these profiles and display ads to you when you visit a website that we have a relationship  
with.

**We do not sell, rent or share any of the anonymous data to third-parties.**

### Opting Out

## Security

If you provide us with your contact or business information in order to conduct business with us as an advertiser or publisher, BaronsMedia.com LLC. uses reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve the integrity and security  
of your information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to BaronsMedia.com LLC. and you do so at your own risk.

### Changes to Privacy Policy

The BaronsMedia.com LLC privacy policy is subject to change without notice.
