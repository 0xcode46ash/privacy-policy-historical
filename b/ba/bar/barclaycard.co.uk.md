 **How do we collect information about you?**

We collect personal and financial information which we obtain from you or from any third parties when you apply for a card or any other product or service or which you or they give us from time to time.  
We will also collect information about you when you register to use the services provided on this Site or when you contact us. We may also collect information through the use of cookies. 

**What are cookies?**

A cookie is a piece of information stored on your computer’s hard drive by your web browser. Cookies can store information about your preferences and other information that you need when you visit a site. We can also use cookies to show us how you are using our Site. We believe cookies help you to use the Site. However, if your browser allows you to, you may switch them off. If you choose not to accept cookies, you will be unable to use the account servicing section of the Site.

 **How will we use the information we collect about you?**

We may put your information on the Barclays Group customer systems and use it in the following ways:  
\- to supply and manage any services we provide to you;  
\- to improve and develop the products we offer;  
\- to learn more about you so that we can identify products and services which may be of interest to you;  
\- to tell you about our own and other companies’ products and services which may interest you. (We may tell you by letter, phone (including automated dialling), digital television or e-mail but we will only let other companies in our group contact you if you have expressly agreed that they can.)  


If you don’t want us to tell you about other products and services please write to us at Dept MTRM, Northampton NN4 7SG and supply us with details of any products you have with us.

 **Will we share your information with anyone else?**

We may need to pass on your information to people who provide a service to us (although we only do this on the understanding that they keep your information confidential), and anyone to whom we may transfer our rights and duties. We may also disclose your information if we have a duty to do so or if the law allows us to.

If we transfer your information to a service provider in another country, we will make sure that the service provider agrees to apply the same levels of protection as we are required to apply to information held in the UK and to use your information only for the purpose of providing the service to us.

 **How long will we keep your personal information on file?**

We will not keep your information for longer than is necessary and will take steps to ensure that it is kept up to date. You have a right under the Data Protection Act 1998 to ask what information we hold about you. You can do this by writing to us at Barclaycard, 1234 Pavilion Drive, Northampton, NN4 7SG.
