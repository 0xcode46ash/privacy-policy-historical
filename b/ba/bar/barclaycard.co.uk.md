# Privacy Policy | Barclaycard

Please read our privacy policy carefully before using this website ("the Site"). In this policy "we", "us", "our" and “ours” means Barclays Bank PLC and "you" means the person using the Site.

## How we collect information about you

We collect personal and financial information from you or third parties every time you apply for a card or any other product. We also collect information about you when you register to use the services we offer on this Site, or when you contact us. We may also gather information using cookies.

## Sharing your information with others

We may need to pass on your information to people who provide a service to us, with the understanding that they keep your information confidential, and to anyone to whom we may transfer our rights and duties. We may also disclose your information if we're required to do so by law.

If we transfer your information to a service provider in another country, we'll make sure they agree to apply the same levels of protection that we adhere to in the UK. They will only use your information for the purpose of providing the service to us.

## How long we keep your personal information on file

We won't keep your information for longer than necessary and will take steps to ensure that it's kept up to date. You have a right, under the Data Protection Act 1998, to ask what information we hold about you.

You can do this by writing to us at:   
Barclaycard

## Security

Please remember that any messages you send over the internet aren't secure unless they are encrypted. We’re not responsible for unauthorised access by a third party or the corruption of any information sent to us.

So for your own security, please don't send us any personal or account information by standard email.

Cookies are harmless text files which web servers store on your computer's hard drive when you visit a site. They allow the server to recognise you when you revisit the site, thus speeding up your experience.

For example, they can remember your login details so that you don’t have to type them in every time you revisit a site. And since they don’t collect personal information about you from your computer, they are completely harmless.

## New requirements on cookies

With regards to the new requirements on Cookies following the revision of the e-Privacy Directive, Barclays is working towards implementing the new requirements in line with guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office.

## Types of cookies

Depending on their origins and ownership, all cookies can be first or third party cookies. First party cookies are owned and created by the website you're viewing. While third party cookies are owned and created by an independent company that may be providing a service to the website owners.

There are two main types of cookies, transient and persistent, and we use both on our Site.

  * **Transient (or per-session)**  
These cookies exist only for the duration of your website visit and are deleted once you leave. They recognise you as you move between pages and record, for example, the items you add to an online shopping basket. They also help maintain security.
  * **Persistent (or permanent)**  
These cookies stay on your machine until expiry or deletion. Many of these cookies are built with automatic deletion dates so that your hard drive doesn't get overloaded. They often store and re-enter your log-in information, so you don't need to remember membership details.



## What we use cookies for

Many companies use cookies to help speed up your online experience. For instance, you save time when you don’t have to enter your login details every time you return to a site.

We use first and third party cookies to:

  * Keep your data secure when you use our online account services such as mybarclaycard. Cookies store information about your preferences to prevent unauthorised access to your account. Without cookies, we can’t ensure your data is secure, so you may not be able to use the service.
  * Gather information about pages visited by people who are browsing our site.
  * Temporarily store details entered into our calculators, tools, illustrations and demonstrations.
  * Store details of marketing, product and other preferences in order to improve our targeting and ensure a better experience for customers who visit our sites.
  * Evaluate the advertising and promotional effectiveness of our websites. We own the anonymous data that’s collected, and don't share it with anyone.



We may also put your information into the Barclays Group customer systems and use it to:

  * Supply and manage services we provide to you.
  * Improve and develop the products we offer.
  * Learn more about you so we can identify products and services that may be of interest to you.
  * Tell you about our own and other companies' products and services which may interest you, by letter, phone, digital television or email. We’ll only let other companies in our group contact you if you've expressly agreed that they can do so.



## What we don’t use cookies for

We don't use cookies to track websites you visit after you leave our sites or store personal information which other people could read. And we'll never sell or distribute cookie information without your prior consent.

## Changing your cookie settings

Cookies form a ‘trail’ of pages you’ve visited online, and won't damage your computer or collect personal information from it. However, if you’d like to stop receiving cookies from us and other sites, all you have to do is change your browser settings by following the manufacturer’s guidelines.

Just bear in mind that some of our online services can’t function without cookies, so your access may be restricted.
