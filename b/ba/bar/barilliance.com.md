# Privacy policy | Barilliance

### Information Collected 

We require customers who use selected services (collectively, the "Service") to give us contact information, such as their name, company name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. 

We may also email information regarding updates to the Service or company, and we might send a Customer Newsletter. Again, customers can opt out of receiving any communication by emailing support@Barilliance.com.

Except as stated at the time we request information, or as contemplated in this policy or the "Barilliance Service Agreement" or required by law, we do not disclose any personally identifiable information (including, without limitation, email addresses) that is provided by customers to third parties.

Customers of the Service will be using the site to host data and information ("hosted data"). The Service also includes connecting to customers' databases and applications ("source data") and extracting a copy of the source data that is then loaded into the Barilliance system. Barilliance will not review, share, distribute, print, or reference any hosted data or source data except as provided in this policy or in the Barilliance Master Subscription Agreement or as may be required by law, and except for the purposes of deploying, supporting or enhancing the service.

Of course, customers are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of their user registration and password.

Barilliance may collect certain information from visitors to the website and customers of the Service. This information is logged to help diagnose technical problems, and to constantly improve the quality of the website and the Service. We may also track and analyze non-identifying and aggregate usage and volume statistical information from our visitors and customers and provide such information to third parties.

### Cookies 

Alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser. Unless you choose to identify yourself to Barilliance, such as responding to a promotional offer or opening an account, you remain anonymous to Barilliance.

Barilliance uses session cookies (cookies that exist only during an online session) containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in to the Service. This information allows Barilliance to process your online transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Barilliance application. Users who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will not be able to successfully use our Service.

Third Party Cookies: We may engage third parties to track and analyze non-personally identifiable usage and volume statistical information from visitors to our website and customers of our service to help us administer the website and the Service and improve its quality. Such third parties may use cookies to help track visitor behavior.

### Opt-Out Policy 

Barilliance offers its visitors and customers a means to choose how we may use information provided. If, at any time after registering for information or ordering the Service, you change your mind about receiving information from us, send us a request specifying your new choice. Simply send your request to support@Barilliance.com.

### Correcting & Updating Your Information 

If customers need to update or change registration information they may do so by editing the user or company profile record. To update a User Profile or Company Profile, log on to Barilliance as an Administrator and perform the updates in the Administration area. To discontinue the Service and to have data returned, email support@Barilliance.com. Barilliance will respond to your correction or update request within at most 30 days from the date of your request.

###  Changes to this Statement 

Barilliance will notify its Clients via email if we make any changes to our Privacy Policy. Any new policy will be posted on our site at least thirty (30) days prior to its taking effect.
