# Privacy - Privacy - London Borough of Barnet

Barnet Council is a registered Data Controller and will only process your personal information in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act). This privacy statement applies to all personal data the council collects and processes whether by letter, email, face to face or online.

Details of how we use information gathered on this website is detailed further down this page.

We endeavour to safeguard the privacy of our residents, service users and website visitors. This statement explains what you can expect in regards to how we collect and use your information.

## What information do we collect?

The amount and type of information the council collects from you depends on why and how you are interacting with the council and the service you are requesting.

This may simply mean providing your name and address. For some services we will need you to provide more details and sometimes sensitive personal data. For example, if you are applying for social services we may need information relating to your health. When we do this we will provide further information as to why we are collecting your information and how we will use it. We will not ask for anything which is not necessary for the service we are providing to you.

## What do we use personal information for?

The information you provide us with is only used for the intended purpose and if we wish to use it for another purpose we will ask you first. In some cases disclosure of your data may be required or permitted under the Act without your specific consent, for example if we have a legal obligation to do so. We will also share data internally to allow us to compile general statistics on how our services are performing. We may also need to share your information with a third party, such as a contractor, in order for them to provide the service you have requested. However, the council requires any third parties to abide by the Data Protection Act 1998 when they process your data on our behalf. 

## Visitors to our websites

When someone visits our website we collect standard internet log information, which allows us to see visitor behaviour patterns.  We do this to determine which pages are being viewed as this assists us in improving our website.  

This information is collected in a way which doesn’t allow us to identify you and we do not make any attempts to find out the identities of individuals visiting our site.

Where we do collect personal information from you when you are visiting our website we will make it clear and tell you that we are doing so. For example, if you register with the website or fill in an online form.

## Cookies

Cookies are small text files that are placed on your computer by websites that you visit. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work more efficiently. Our cookie policy is set to be compliant with the EU Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive. 

We use two cookies on this site:

  * TestCookie - to determine whether a user's browser accepts cookies and can therefore log in. 


  * PHPSESSID (ASP.NET_SessionId on .Net systems) - used to store the individual session id of a user. This is required to determine whether a user is logged in to the web site. Session data is also stored when a user is filling in a form, however the data is stored on the server and not in the cookie.



Both of these cookies are required for the site to operate and do not contain personal data.  We do not store any cookies on your computer.

## Social media

Any details you provide to register with council for social media such as Twitter and Facebook will only be used for that purpose. We do not cross reference these details with any other information held by the council.

## Computer Viruses

Barnet Council makes every effort to ensure all information is virus checked before it is uploaded and made available on this site. The council cannot accept responsibility for any loss or damage which may occur from use of downloaded documents, it is the responsibility of users to re-check all downloaded documents with their own virus check software.

## Email Messages

We are keen to ensure that we are providing our citizens with services that they need. Consequently, you may receive occasional email messages from Barnet Council on matters that we consider may be of interest to you based on your previous interaction with us.

## Access to Information - Data Protection and You
