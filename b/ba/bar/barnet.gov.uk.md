# Privacy - Privacy - London Borough of Barnet

Barnet Council is a registered Data Controller and will only process your personal information in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act). This privacy statement applies to all personal data the council collects and processes whether by letter, email, face to face or online.

We endeavour to safeguard the privacy of our residents, service users and website visitors. This statement explains what you can expect in regards to how we collect and use your information.

## What information do we collect?

The amount and type of information the council collects from you depends on why and how you are interacting with the council and the service you are requesting.

This may simply mean providing your name and address. For some services we will need you to provide more details and sometimes sensitive personal data. For example, if you are applying for social services we may need information relating to your health. When we do this we will provide further information as to why we are collecting your information and how we will use it. We will not ask for anything which is not necessary for the service we are providing to you.

## What do we use personal information for?

The information you provide us with is only used for the intended purpose and if we wish to use it for another purpose we will ask you first. In some cases disclosure of your data may be required or permitted under the Act without your specific consent, for example if we have a legal obligation to do so. We will also share data internally to allow us to compile general statistics on how our services are performing. We may also need to share your information with a third party, such as a contractor, in order for them to provide the service you have requested. However, the council requires any third parties to abide by the Data Protection Act 1998 when they process your data on our behalf.
