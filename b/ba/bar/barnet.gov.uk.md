# Privacy - London Borough of Barnet

The London Borough of Barnet has developed a commissioning model which places great importance on using data and information about the borough, its residents and service users, to develop strategies and make decisions. A commissioning model gives us greater scope to tailor services to the needs of users and greatly increases the likelihood of us achieving our aims and objectives. 

This privacy notice explains how the council uses the information you give us and how it ensures that it is appropriately protected.  As a ‘commissioning council’ we work with a number of partner organisations to deliver services, further details on this are in the “Who do we share information with?” section below. 

We endeavour to safeguard the privacy of our residents, service users and website visitors. This statement explains what you can expect in regards to how we collect and use your information.

### Why we collect personal information

As a local authority we collect and process a considerable amount of information that is required in order for us to undertake our functions as a local authority. Any personal information we hold is processed in accordance with the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 (the Act or DPA). 

The council’s privacy statement applies to all personal data collected for or on behalf of the council whether by letter, email, face to face, telephone or online. 

Call recording - Not all council services record or monitor telephone calls. Where we do, this will be made clear to you via an automated message at the start of your call. 

### What do we use personal information for? 

We use information in a number of different ways: 

  * For the purpose for which you provided the information eg processing information given on a benefit claim form for the purpose of handling your benefit claim, and to monitor the council’s performance in responding to your request.
  * To allow the council to communicate and provide services appropriate to your needs eg providing assistance to new parents, highlighting any free services or additional help available to you.
  * For insight purposes which allows us to analyse patterns and trends of service usage. We use this insight for service and financial planning to help us create policy and inform decision making eg allowing us to place children’s centres in areas where they are most needed.
  * To ensure that the council meets its duties, including obligations imposed under the Equality and Health and Safety Acts.
  * Where necessary for law enforcement functions eg licensing, planning enforcement, trading standards and food safety where the council is legally obliged to undertake such processing.
  * Where the processing is necessary to comply with legal obligations eg the prevention and/or detection of crime.
  * To process financial transactions including grants, payments and benefits involving the council, or where the council is acting on behalf of other government bodies eg Department for Work and Pensions.
  * To allow us to verify your identity when seeking services from the council.
  * Where otherwise permitted under the Data Protection Act 1998. For further information on the DPA refer to the [Information Commissioner’s website](http://www.ico.gov.uk/ "Information Commissioner’s website ").



We are keen to ensure that we are providing our citizens with services that they need. Therefore, we may contact you for the purpose of making you aware of services or support which we think may be of interest to you. 

From time to time we may also seek your feedback on how we are performing or seek your views on services which you have been using. 

### Who do we share information with? 

Information the council collects is routinely shared between council services as well as with other third parties such as government bodies, the police, health and social care organisations and educational establishments. 

As a ‘commissioning council’ we work with a number of partner organisations and contracted service providers to deliver services. These include: Barnet Homes for the delivery of housing services; Your Choice Barnet for provision of specialist social care and support to adults; Capita via the Customer Support Group (CSG) contract for services such as HR and Revenues and Benefits; the joint venture company Re Limited for delivery of services such as planning and environmental health.

Additionally we have a number of partnering arrangements for services such as public health and legal services. We only share information with these organisations where it is appropriate and legal to do so. The council requires its third parties to abide by the Data Protection Act 1998 and routinely undertakes checks with its providers before information is shared, to ensure that there are sufficient systems and procedures in place to protect your information.

### **Insight**

As a local authority we are constantly looking at ways of improving how we provide services to our residents and service users, as we are required to do by law. The information you provide us with in your day-to-day dealings helps us to create an understanding about who our customers are and how they use our services. By bringing together and analysing customer information that the council holds (creating insight) it will allow us to deliver high quality services where they are most needed. 

### **My Account - Single Customer View**

Customers will be able to follow a registration process to create a ‘My Account’ on the council’s website. It is envisaged that My Account will hold a brief summary of contact you have had with the council’s Customer Services, as well as general information such as your address, date of birth and gender. It will also be used by officers delivering customer services to enable them to respond to any queries you may have more quickly and efficiently. 

### **Data Matching**

We routinely check information provided by you or information supplied by an external organisation about you against other information held by the council. The council may also obtain information from certain external organisations or provide information to them in order to: 

  * verify the accuracy of the information we hold 
  * prevent or detect crime 
  * protect public funds from fraud 
  * comply with the council's legal obligations 
  * assist with research and statistical purposes 



The Audit Commission also requires local authorities to participate in data matching exercises which assist in the prevention and/or detection of fraud. Data matching by the Audit Commission is subject to a Code of Practice and further information can be located on the [Audit Commission](http://www.audit-commission.gov.uk/national-fraud-initiative/) website. ****

### **Access to Information**

Under the Data Protection Act 1998, you can have the right to make a formal request for personal information the council hold about you.  This is known as a **Subject Access Request**.
