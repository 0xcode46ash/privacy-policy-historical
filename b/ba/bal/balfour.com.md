##  Privacy Policy

Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. To protect your privacy, we are providing this information to explain our online information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used.

##  About The Information We Collect

From our Web site at various times you may be able to order products, enter contests, participate in a survey, subscribe to e-mail notices, or participate in an online forum. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected at these pages include: name, age, address, e-mail address, telephone number, school, grade, and information about your interests in and use of various products, programs, and services.

In some cases you can submit information about other people. For example, you might submit a person's name and e-mail address to send an electronic greeting card of a selected class ring. The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, age, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.

At certain parts of some of our site, only persons who provide us with the requested personally identifiable information will be able to order products, programs, and services or otherwise participate in the site's activities and offerings.

We also may collect other non- identifiable information when you visit our site such as the Web browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink).

##  How We Use the Information We Collect

We may use the information you provide to fulfill your requests for our products, programs, and services, to respond to your inquiries about our offerings, and to offer you other products, programs or services that we believe may be of interest to you. We sometimes use this information to communicate with you, such as to notify you when you have won one of our contests or when we make changes to our subscriber agreements, to fulfill a request by you for an online newsletter, or to contact you about your account with us. We use the information that you provide about others to enable us to send them your gifts or catalogs. From time to time, we also may use this information to offer our products, programs, or services to them. The information we collect in connection with our online forums and communities is used to provide an interactive experience. We use this information to facilitate participation in these online forums and communities and, from time to time, to offer you products, programs, or services. We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services. We may disclose personally identifiable information in response to legal process, for example, in response to a court order or a subpoena. We also may disclose such information in response to a law enforcement agency's request. Agents and contractors of Commemorative Brands, Inc. who have access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for Commemorative Brands, Inc.. Although we take appropriate measures to safeguard against unauthorized disclosures of information, we cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Balfour will not disclose personally identifiable information to companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, magazine publishers, retailers, participatory databases, and non-profit organizations). Finally, Commemorative Brands, Inc. will not use or transfer personally identifiable information provided to us in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you with an opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.

##  Collection of Information by Third-Party Sites

Our site contains links to other sites whose information practices may be different than ours. Visitors should consult the other sites' privacy notices as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties.

##  Cookies

To enhance your experience with our sites, many of our web pages use "cookies." Cookies are text files we place in your computer's browser to store your preferences. Cookies, by themselves, do not tell us your e-mail address or other personally identifiable information unless you choose to provide this information to us by, for example, registering at one of our sites. However, once you choose to furnish the site with personally identifiable information, this information may be linked to the data stored in the cookie. We use cookies to understand site usage and to improve the content and offerings on our sites. For example, we may use cookies to personalize your experience at our web pages (e.g., to recognize you by name when you return to our site), save your password in password-protected areas, and enable you to use shopping carts on our sites. We also may use cookies to offer you products, programs, or services.
