BAL collects information that you submit via online forms on its www.balglobal.com/ www.balglobal.com/questionnaire, www.balglobal.com/cims and www.balglobal.com/statuschek website.  You may use an online form, for example, to register for a seminar sponsored by BAL or to receive news.  The information you enter may include, for example, your name, title, company, address, telephone number and e-mail address.  If BAL is handling your visa or immigration matter, the information you provide may include your personal and family information, educational background, and employment history. 

The information you submit will be retained by BAL in a database maintained by BAL or its service provider, and will be used by BAL to complete your request or to provide immigration services.  We do not sell your personal information to third parties.  BAL will not share the information with any third party, except as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Statement.  BAL may share the information to complete your request or as necessary to provide immigration services to you and your family, including disclosure to government agencies in the form of applications and petitions for immigration benefits.  BAL may also share the information with a successor in interest, an affiliate or its consultants, who are obligated to maintain the confidentiality of the information.  For example, if BAL merges with another law firm, BAL may share the information with that firm.  BAL may also share the information as permitted or required by law.  For example, BAL may provide the information in response to a subpoena, a law enforcement or governmental agency request, or a court order. 

BAL may also use the information retained in the database to communicate with you directly via e-mail or direct mail, such as to inform you about newsworthy topics and upcoming events that may be of interest to you, or to confer with you regarding your immigration case.  For example, BAL may use your e-mail address to send you the firm's Legal Update newsletter, to send you an announcement concerning an upcoming seminar, or to send you questions or drafts relating to your immigration case.  To guard your nonpublic personal information, we maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards.  After our services conclude, Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP will, as a courtesy to you, make its best efforts to retain the personal data you have provided for a period of six (6) years.  At the end of said period, we may, at our discretion, destroy such personal data without notice to you.
