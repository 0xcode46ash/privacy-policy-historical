**1. _Overview and Legal Compliance_**

1.1 Baird & Warner Holding Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Baird & Warner," "B&W," "We," "Us" or "Our") created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate Our commitment to protecting the privacy of visitors to Our home page located at [www.bairdwarner.com](http://www.bairdwarner.com/) (the "Web Site"). This Policy applies only to information collected via the Web Site. We will collect information only from people over the age of 18.

**2. _Your Information, How We Collect and Use It_**

2.1 You may be required to provide Us with certain information when using the Web Site. You agree that the information You provide will be true and accurate. You consent to Our verifying any information that You provide.

2.2 Here's how We collect and use information from You in Our efforts to provide You with a superior customized online experience:

**IP Address -** An IP or "Internet Protocol" address is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You're surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify Your computer by its IP address. Your IP address and other site usage data are used to gather broad demographic information. This data helps Us serve You by allowing Us to understand how visitors use our Web Sites. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer remains anonymous to Us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with Our Terms of Use or to protect Our service, Web Site, customers or others.

**Cookies -** Our sites use a technology called "cookies," small files stored by Your browser to help keep track of Your user profile. Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information. We use cookies to remember Your personal profile for Your convenience, to deliver content specific to Your needs and interests, and to ensure You do not see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to track User trends and improve areas of Our Web Sites that Our Users find valuable. The use of cookies is an industry standard found at most major web sites.

**Registration -** Some of Our Web Sites include registration forms that require Users to give Us contact information (like Your name), unique identifiers (like Your email address), and demographic information (like Your Zip code or age). We use contact information from registration forms to send You information related to Our products and services if You consent to receiving such mailings. Your contact information may also be used to contact You when necessary for administrative purposes related to Your account. We use Your email as a unique identifier in our record system, to verify communications from You, and to send You newsletters and promotion offerings that You ask to receive or to tell You about changes to the Web Site.

**3. _Security_**

3.1 We are concerned with the security of Your Information. We use our best commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your Information, using devices like firewalls and Secure Socket Layers. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet is guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, We cannot ensure the security of any Information You transmit to Us or receive from Our online products or services. Accordingly, You transmit and receive Information at Your own risk.

**4. _Email Services: Opting Out_**

    1. If You take advantage of any email notification features on Our sites, You will receive email updates as described in the service.
    2. We provide Users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from Us. To remove Your name from an email service, simply click on the "Unsubscribe" link at the bottom of the email and type in Your information.
    3. If You have any questions regarding privacy on Our Web Site, You may email Us.



**5. _Personal Tools and Discussion Groups_**

5.1 Certain products on Our sites allow You to store Your personal information for future use. We do not share this information with third parties, other than as set forth above.

5.2 We offer email Discussion Groups for the use of Our Users and prospective customers. We moderate these Discussion Groups that cover a wide range of topics. You should be aware that information disclosed in these Discussion Groups is made available to all Discussion Group members and thus becomes public information. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information.

**6**. **_Surveys_**

6.1 We may survey Users for contact information, unique identifiers and demographic information. You are never required to answer these questions. The information You submit may be used for analyzing overall site demographics, preferences and tastes, and similar "getting to know Our customers" purposes. We may disclose this data to third parties in an aggregated form (such as summary reports for our advertisers) but never with User data or identification information.

**7.** ** _Outside Links_**

7.1 While on the Web Site, You may be led to other web sites. Be aware that other sites may collect data and personal information and operate according to their own privacy practices. Please remember that once you are outside of Our Web Site, any information You submit is outside of Our control.

**8**. **_Disclosure_**

8.1 To provide You the best products and services, We team with business partners. When You indicate that You want to receive a product or service, or contact a person or organization, We share the data needed for You to receive that product or service or make that contact. Occasionally, We hire consultants who may need access to Our member database to perform their services for Us. We require that these business partners agree in writing not to use any member information. We may contract with outside companies to administer our mailing lists or provide retail services. Your personal information may be shared with an outside company for the sole purpose of administering the products, services and programs you have selected. We may disclose Your personally identifiable information to comply with the law, government orders, court orders, or legal process served on Us or to protect and defend Our property, rights or Users. Further, in the unlikely event that B&W merges with or is acquired by another business entity or some or all of its assets are acquired, your personal information will necessarily be a business asset that is acquired in the transaction.

**9. _Changing your Personal Information_**

9.1 You may update, correct or delete your personal information, by contacting us at Baird & Warner, 120 South LaSalle Street, Suite 2000, Chicago, IL 60603.
