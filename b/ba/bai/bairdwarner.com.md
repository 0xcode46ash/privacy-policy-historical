**2. _Your Information, How We Collect and Use It_**

2.1 You may be required to provide Us with certain information when using the Web Site. You agree that the information You provide will be true and accurate. You consent to Our verifying any information that You provide. We may disclose Your personally identifiable information (1) to comply with the law, government orders, court orders, or legal process served on Us; (2) to protect and defend Our property, rights or Users.

2.2 Here's how We collect and use information from You in Our efforts to provide You with a superior customized online experience:

****

**IP Address -** An IP or "Internet Protocol" address is a number that is automatically assigned to Your computer whenever You're surfing the Internet. Web servers automatically identify Your computer by its IP address. Your IP address and other site usage data are used to gather broad demographic information.  This data helps Us serve You by allowing Us to understand how visitors use our Web Sites. We normally do not link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a Customer's session will be logged, but the Customer remains anonymous to Us. We can and will use IP addresses to identify a Customer when We feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with Our Terms of Use or to protect Our service, Web Site, customers or others. 

****

**Cookies -** Our sites use a technology called "cookies," small files stored by Your browser to help keep track of Your user profile.  Our cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, nor do We share them with anyone.  We use cookies to remember Your personal profile for Your convenience, to deliver content specific to Your needs and interests, and to ensure You do not see the same ad repeatedly.  We also use cookies to track User trends and improve areas of Our Web Sites that Our Users find valuable. The use of cookies is an industry standard found at most major web sites.

****

**Registration -** Some of Our Web Sites include registration forms that require Users to give Us contact information (like Your name), unique identifiers (like Your email address), and demographic information (like Your Zip code or age).  We use contact information from registration forms to send You information related to Our products and services if You consent to receiving such mailings.  Your contact information may also be used to contact You when necessary for administrative purposes related to Your account.  We use Your email as a unique identifier in our record system, to verify communications from You, and to send You newsletters and promotion offerings that You ask to receive or to tell You about changes to the Web Site.
