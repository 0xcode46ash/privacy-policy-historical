Bain takes user privacy very seriously because we know that your privacy on the web is important to you. We may collect the e-mail addresses of those who send us e-mail messages, however, we will not share those addresses with any other company or send unsolicited e-mail to any of the addresses we collect, except in the limited circumstances set forth below. Bain has implemented generally accepted standards of technology and operational security in order to protect your personally identifiable information from loss, misuse, alteration, or destruction. Despite these precautions, however, Bain cannot guarantee that unauthorized persons will not obtain access to your personally identifiable information. 

When you request information from Bain and/or supply information that personally identifies you and/or allows us to contact you, including but not limited to, when you opt in to receive emails from Bain or agree to participate in surveys, you are agreeing to share such information with Bain, its agents, representatives and affiliates and you should know that Bain may disclose such information to its agents, representatives and affiliates for marketing and promotional purposes. Note, however, that you will have the ability to opt out of receiving future emails from Bain, to unsubscribe from participating in our programs through the "preferences" page to which you may direct yourself from every email you receive from Bain and to correct or change personally identifiable information you have provided to Bain by replying to any Bain email. We may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (1) comply with law or comply with legal process served upon us or our agents, representatives and affiliates, (2) protect and defend our rights or property or those of our users or (3) protect the personal safety of our users or the public.

In addition, certain message boards and similar user forums may display IP addresses along with the message poster's name and message. Bain bears no responsibility for any action or policies of any third parties who collect any information users may disclose on the message boards, chat areas or other user forums, if any, on the website.
