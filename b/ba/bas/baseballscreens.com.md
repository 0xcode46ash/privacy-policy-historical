# PracticeSports.com - Practice Sports

Practice Sports respects your privacy, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. 

If you visit any of our Websites (collectively, the “Sites”) and/or access the services offered by us, we have designed our system to protect your privacy. Our system will be able to ascertain your geographic location from your IP address, but we do not collect IP addresses or e-mail addresses, and we do not track the sites that you access while you use our services unless (i) we are required to do so by law; (ii) we have reason to believe that you have violated the terms and conditions of the Practice Sports’ policies; (iii) you have caused or attempted to cause harm to us or the other users of our Sites; and/or (iv) you voluntarily provide us with personal information (as described below).

Two types of information may be collected when you visit our Sites:

**Personal and Company information** , (such as name, address, telephone number, e mail address, social security number, credit card numbers, or credit information) which is only collected by us if you voluntarily submit it to us. For example, if you voluntarily register with us on our [registration site] or place an order with us, we will receive the registration information that you submit so that we can better ensure that you are receiving the information, products or services that you requested; and

**Aggregate information** , automatically collected non-identifying statistics, (such as information about how many visitors log on to the Sites). Our servers will collect third party sites, and information from these sites, from your use of the Sites. Practice Sports uses this information to measure the use of our Sites, to improve the content of our Sites, and to provide our users with the best possible services.

In sum, you can visit our Sites without telling us who you are or revealing personal information about yourself. However, you can, if you choose, participate in additional secured applications. For access to these applications, you are required to complete a registration form with us. This form includes information such as name, address, phone number and e-mail address. We use this information to enhance our services, to better meet the needs and preferences of our customers, and to enhance the security of our Sites. We may also from time to time, send information to registered users about system changes or new products that we think may be of interest.

Practice Sports does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except to provide services that you have requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our policies, or as otherwise required by law.

We may transfer information about you if Practice Sports is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Practice Sports will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Links to Other Sites

We provide links to a number of third-party external sites. The inclusion of any link does not imply our endorsement of the external site company, its Website or Websites, or the products and services it promotes or sells. When you leave our Sites to visit one of these linked sites, the only information transferred to the third party is the fact that you came from our Sites.
