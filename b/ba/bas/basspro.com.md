## Security Back to top

* * *

### How We Strive to Protect Personal Information

At Bass Pro we have electronic and corporate policies and procedures in place for the security of every order placed online. We use Secure Socket Layer technology (SSL) to keep others from intercepting your information while it is being transmitted across the Internet. SSL technology is the industry standard method of communicating secure online transactions and is built into most major browsers. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. All information, once on our server, is protected from any external intrusions. Once your order is processed, we will not retain your credit card number in our online systems. Only Bass Pro employees who require your Personal Information to serve you have access to your data, which is password protected. Employees who have access to Personal Information are trained in the privacy and security practices of this Statement.

Bass Pro provides links to web sites outside of BassPro.com as an added convenience to our users. Bass Pro is not responsible for the privacy, terms of use or other policies of any other web site or their management of your Personal Information.

### Email Abuse

There are many unscrupulous individuals operating on the internet today who would think nothing of fabricating an email to make it appear that it comes from Bass Pro. These individuals may be engaging in a practice known as "phishing" in which they attempt to trick unwary recipients of email into divulging Personal Information. Bass Pro will rarely, if ever, request Personal Information in an unsolicited email message to you.

If you have any question about the genuineness of an email you receive that appears to be from Bass Pro contact us at abuse@basspro.com and do not furnish Personal Information in response to the email unless its authenticity can be verified.

Transaction Security 

Secured communications on the web require attention to authentication, encryption and data integrity. All three are addressed by the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. Authentication is the process of establishing that you are communicating with our web server, as opposed to another server assuming our identity. We have obtained a VerisignTM digital security certificate for BassPro.com and basspro-shops.com. VerisignTM is an independent third party that authenticates the identity of others on the Internet. The VerisignTM certificate confirms that we are the recipients of your communication. Encryption is the process of scrambling data (through the use of keys and mathematical encoding algorithms) to prohibit anyone from understanding it if they intercept the data while it is on its way from your browser to our server. Encryption protects communications between your browser and our mainframe system. We have also implemented a firewall to protect all of our systems from intrusion. Data Integrity ensures the data passed between your browser and our server is not being tampered with while in transit. SSL protects information en route to us, and as mentioned, the VerisignTM certificate confirms that we are the recipients of this information. You can be assured that we strive to protect your data with the utmost care at all points in the process. However, no data transmission over the Internet or any wireless network can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure. Therefore, we do not warrant or ensure the security of any information sent to us online. If you have questions, comments or concerns please contact us via email at privacy@basspro.com or call us at 1-800-552-4868.

To ensure you are in SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or secure mode for your transactions, look at the address of the page. Secure pages will usually appear with an address that begins with https:// rather than the standard http://.

While we take steps to protect your Personal Information and keep it secure, you also play a role in protecting your information. You can help to maintain the security of your online transactions by not sharing your user name or password with anyone. If we receive instructions using your log-in information and password we will assume that the instructions have been authorized by you. Any information or content that you post or upload to these Sites or our communities is publicly available and is not secured. Likewise, emails sent to and from these Sites are not secure; please do not use email to transmit sensitive information to us.
