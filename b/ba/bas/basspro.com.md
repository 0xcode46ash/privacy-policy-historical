At Bass Pro Outdoors Online, L.L.C., we have electronic and corporate policy procedures in place for the security of every order placed online. 

[](https://digitalid.verisign.com/as2/c72b61fbe86d3b4a70a8981759b1bbdf) We use a Stronghold SSL server to keep others from intercepting your information while being transmitted across the Internet. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. 

All information, once on our server, is protected from any external intrusions. Once your order is processed, we will not retain your credit card number in our online systems. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Make sure to sign off each time when finished using a shared computer. Your credit card information will be safe when you place an order at basspro.com. Bass Pro Outdoors Online, L.L.C. takes necessary steps to pursue all credit card complaints or disputes. Only Bass Pro Outdoors Online, L.L.C. employees who require personal information to best serve our customers have access to your data. This data is password protected with access only to those selected employees. Those employees are trained in the privacy and security practices of this Statement. 

If you still do not wish to provide your credit card information for an online order, you may telephone, fax, or mail your order to us. (see **Customer Service**)

**_Whether your browser in SSL or secure mode_**  
Back to Top

Secured communications on the web require attention to authentication, encryption and data integrity. All three are addressed by the SSL protocol. To ensure you are in SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or secure mode for your transactions, there are certain items you can check depending on the particular browser you use. SSL mode is an encryption device that protects your personal information. Encryption is the process of scrambling data (through the use of keys and mathematical encoding algorithms) to prohibit anyone from understanding it if they intercept the data while it is on its way from your browser to our server. Encryption protects communications between your browser and our mainframe system. We have also implemented a fire wall to protect all of our systems which are not part of the Internet from intrusion. You can be assured that we strive to protect your data with the utmost care at all points in the process. Authentication is the process of establishing confidence that you are communicating with our web server, as opposed to another server assuming our identity. SSL accomplishes this through the use of public/private keys and a digital certificate. Data Integrity ensures the data passed between your browser and our server is not being tampered with while in transit. Many browsers that have a symbol to indicate secure mode below are a few popular ones. 

**Netscape Navigator**  
**Version 4.0:** A lock will appear on the lower left side of your browser window. If this lock is open, you are unsecured. If the lock is closed, you are in a secure transmission mode. 

**Version 2.0/3.0:** A key will appear at the lower left side of your browser window. If the key is broken, you are unsecured. If the key is complete, you are in a secure transmission mode. 

**Microsoft Internet Explorer**  
A closed lock on the lower right side of the browser window will indicate a secure transmission mode. If you are unsecured, the lock will not be present. 

**On all browsers**  
Look for the "http" to be replaced with "https" in your browsers location/address window. This indicates that you are accessing a secure server. A blue border around your browser's screen is also very common when interacting with a secure area. 

**_Updates to our web site policies and this Statement_**  
Back to Top

On occasion we make changes to our policies and/or alter the look and functionality of our web site. We will update this Statement accordingly. We encourage you to periodically review this Statement for the latest information on our privacy and security policies. Our current Statement was last updated September 10, 2001.
