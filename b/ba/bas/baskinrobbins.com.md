# Baskin-Robbins

We want you to enjoy every visit to BaskinRobbins.com, whether you're here to participate in our Birthday Club, order treats or to tell us about your last trip to one of our shops. So rest assured, any information you share with us, from your email address to your favorite flavor, will be carefully guarded through our use of industry-standard security software to encrypt your credit card number, ordering and shipping information and other personal information. Please read on for more details about our privacy policy.

Baskin-Robbins reserves the right to change this privacy policy at any time. Be sure to check this page periodically for updates. This policy applies only to personal information collected online at BaskinRobbins.com and does not apply to information collected offline by Baskin-Robbins.

**What kind of information we ask for and why.**
    **Inquiries.** If you request information from Baskin-Robbins, or wish to share an experience you had at one of our stores, we'll ask for personal information such as your name, address, and email address, as well as store address and any other information you may wish to share, so that we can best respond to your comments.
    **Promotional Events.** If you choose to take part in a promotional event, we'll ask for any information necessary to the administration of the event such as your name, email address, and shipping address. We may, on occasion, co-sponsor promotions with third parties. We will notify you at the time of collection if third parties will obtain your personal information. 
    **Surveys.** From time-to-time we may post surveys on our Site. The surveys may request demographic information (such as age range, gender, areas of interest, and familiarity with Baskin-Robbins products and services) and customer feedback. Participation in these requests is completely voluntary and with each request you will have the choice of whether or not to disclose information. Such survey information will be used to improve the overall experience on BaskinRobbins.com.
    

**Aggregate Information.** We collect Aggregate Information about you and your use of our Web site whenever you visit us online. For instance, we may collect various forms of "click stream" information such as entry and exit points for our Web site (i.e., referring URLs or domains), site traffic statistics, page views, impressions, and operating system and browser type. In addition, when users request pages on our Web site, our servers automatically log their IP addresses. An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer whenever you are surfing the Web.

We also use third-party software that tracks traffic directed to BaskinRobbins.com from affiliate Web sites and the purchases that result from this traffic. This information is aggregated and is not tied to an individual purchase.

This Aggregate Information generally will not personally identify you or be correlated to you individually for external purposes. We may collect, compile, store, publish, promote, report, sell, or otherwise disclose or use any and all Aggregate Information, provided that, such information does not personally identify you. When we share such information with other companies, it is not traceable to any particular user, and will not be used to contact you. If we do correlate any Aggregate Information to you, such information will be treated like any other Personal Information under this policy.

**E-Mail Updates**
    Unless we hear from you otherwise, we'll email you occasional updates about new additions to this site as well as special offers you can take advantage of at your local Baskin-Robbins. If you choose so, we will also send updates on our sister brand's Dunkin' Donuts and Togo's. If at any time you decide you'd rather not receive this type of information, just visit your Birthday Club account profile to choose not to receive such information.
**Disclosures**
    

We won't give any of your personal information to anyone outside of Baskin-Robbins and our sister brands, Dunkin' Donuts and Togo's, other than our agents who may need, for example, to fulfill your order, respond to your requests or inquiries, or help us improve our products or website. We require our agents to respect our privacy practices and not use your personal information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.

Baskin-Robbins reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety.

**Children's Information**
    

Baskin-Robbins recognizes the need to provide additional privacy protection to children. Children 12 years old and younger may visit BaskinRobbin.com without disclosing any personally identifiable information. However, it is sometimes necessary to collect some personally identifiable information about children in order to allow them to use a feature of our site (like joining the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club). In addition, be aware that all sites that are targeted to children 12 and younger are prohibited by law from collecting more information than they need.

Only a parent or guardian may register a child 12 or younger for the Baskin-Robbins Birthday Club. When a parent registers a child for the Birthday Club, we request the child's name, telephone number, address and e-mail address (if different from the parent's address), date of birth, gender and favorite ice cream flavor. We collect this information in order to verify the child's age, send personalized Birthday Club e-cards, and provide other Birthday Club benefits (such as sweepstakes, newsletters, e-cards and special offers). Parents may review this information at any time by going to the Birthday Club section of the web site.

We will not disclose any children's information to anyone outside of Baskin-Robbins, our sister brands - Dunkin' Donuts and Togo's - and our agents and franchisees. Our sister brands have access to children's information and are jointly responsible for protecting children's privacy, but please direct all communication concerning children's information to Baskin-Robbins (contact information is given below). Our agents may need children's personal information in order to fill an order, respond to a request or help provide Birthday Club services, prevent fraud, or assist us in the management and improvement of our website. Our franchisees may need children's personal information in order to help us provide Birthday Club services and prevent fraud. We require our agents and franchisees to respect our privacy practices concerning children's information and not use children's information for purposes other than to carry out our instructions.

Parents may request at any time that we delete information about their children from our databases. If you would like to deactivate your child's Birthday Club account, please visit your user profile and remove your child from the registration list.

**How we protect your credit card and other personal information.**
    

When you input your credit card number and other personal information, we use a sophisticated software program (Secure Socket Layer Technology or SSL) to encrypt or scramble that information before it's sent so that even if anyone intercepts the information, it is highly unlikely that they will be able to read or use it. In addition, we take appropriate security measures to safeguard your personal information once we have received it.
