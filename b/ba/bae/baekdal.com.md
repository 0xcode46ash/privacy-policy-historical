## Personal information we collect

When you visit this site the following information is collected automatically:

### IP-Number (e.g. 209.194.2.184)

It is used in our statistics reports to create summaries of visitors, hits, page views, and where our readers come from (geographically). We also collect IP-numbers in case of misuse - so that we can either report this to the authorities or prevent future access.

### Browser and Operating System

It is used for statistics, to provide summaries of how many use each browser and how many use a particular operating system. It is also used as a way to tailor the pages. Today there is a slight difference in how the site is displayed if you use a newsreader vs. a browser. In the future we might create special versions of this site for visual impaired or for people using mobile devices. We can do this automatically by collecting this kind of information - hopefully giving you a better experience.
