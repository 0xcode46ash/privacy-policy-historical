ANONYMIZED DATA

We may create anonymous data records from your personal data by excluding information that makes the data personally identifiable to you. We use this anonymous data to analyze request and usage patterns so that we may enhance the content of our Services and improve the Platform. We reserve the right to use anonymous data for any purpose and disclose anonymous data to third parties in our sole discretion.

HOW DO WE SHARE AND DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES?

Only in those instances we have your consent will BADI communicate your data to third companies outside our company. However, we may share and disclose information (including Personal Information) about our customers to with third party vendors, consultants and other service providers who we employ to perform tasks on our behalf necessary for the functioning of the Platform.

On the other hand, third parties located outside the European Union may access your personal data for the sole purpose of providing services that are necessary to manage and offer our users our services and products. In this regard, we inform you that we only select service providers that offer adequate guarantees of protection of your data, and which are adhere to

the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: [https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en](https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-transfers-outside-eu/eu-us-privacy-shield_en).

WHAT CHOICES DO YOU HAVE REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR DATA?

We have created mechanisms to provide you with the following control over your information:

(a)    **tracking technologies and advertising.** You can set your browser to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you disable or refuse cookies, please note that some parts of the Platform may then be inaccessible or not function properly.

(b)    **Opt-out.** You may “opt out” of receiving marketing or promotional emails from us by following the instructions in those emails. If you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional emails, such as emails about your accounts or our ongoing business relations. Also, you will still receive—as your operating system allows—non-marketing push notifications about matters regarding the use of the platform, such as patch updates or changes to the platform.

WHAT ARE YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING PERSONAL DATA?

**Right to access and rectification**

You have the right to obtain information on what personal data BADI processes regarding you, the source of the data, for what purposes the data has been used, and the identity of parties to whom the data has been provided. If a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of its repetitive character, BADI may also refuse to act on the request.

You have also the right to, at any time, request a correction of any inaccurate or incomplete personal data.

**Right to erasure (‘right to be forgotten’)**

You may request that your personal data be erased in specific circumstance, for example, if you have deleted your user profile, the personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purposes for which is was collected if there is no lawful reason for continuation of processing, the processing is unlawful, or the personal data has to be erased or anonymized to comply with a legal obligation in the European Union. This list is not exhaustive. Please contact BADI to receive further information on erasure of your personal data.

**Right to object**

You are entitled to object to processing of personal data that we base on our legitimate interest on grounds relating to your particular situation. If you lodge an objection, and the processing is based on a legitimate interest, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling and legitimate reasons for such processing that overrides your privacy interest.

However, please note that even if you object to certain processing, BADI may continue such processing if it is based on another legitimate basis, for example to provide services to you (should you still want to receive them) or to fulfil legal obligations.

**Right to restriction**

You can request that processing of your personal data is restricted if the personal data may not be correct, if you consider the processing to be unlawful, if BADI is basing its processing on a legitimate interest or if you believe that BADI does no longer need the personal data for providing you its services or products.

**Right to withdraw consent**

If you at any time have provided a consent to BADI for processing of personal data, you can always withdraw such consent for any future processing that is reliant on such consent.

**Right to data portability**

You have the right to receive the personal data concerning you, which you have provided to us, and that we process based on consent or to perform our agreement with you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format. You may also ask us to transmit such data directly to another controller where technically feasible.
