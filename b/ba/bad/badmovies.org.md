# Badmovies.org Privacy Policy

WHO ARE YOU?  
  
Online privacy should be important to you. This page outlines exactly what information is gathered when you visit Badmovies.org. 

Do not make the mistake of thinking you are anonymous while online. If someone wants to find you, they will. The Badmovies.org server does keep logs, intended to assist in debugging and also controlling criminal activity. These logs are private, only available to myself and the hosting administrators. A program on the server provides general statistical information about traffic and that is all. If you click on the review for [Plan Nine from Outer Space](https://web.archive.org/movies/plannine/) then the program lets me know ten thousand and one people have now read the review, vice ten thousand. Only by manually checking the server log can I start to identify you. Unless you have been doing something naughty, I really do not have the time. 

So who can track you easily? Advertising agencies who I am affiliated with. Often (99% of the time) banner ads place a "cookie" on you computer. Usually it is intended to provide them demographic information. I can not control how they use this information. If you are looking for more on the subject I suggest reading the [Electronic Frontier Foundation's website.](http://www.eff.org/Privacy/eff_privacy_top_12.html)

You are not required to register or provide any personal information on this site. The site does use cookies for the Forum. They are required for the software; I do not use them to gather information. 

Once you leave the Internet stockade that is Badmovies.org I can not guarantee your safety. Beware, grinning tentacled death or a naked woman may be one click away.
