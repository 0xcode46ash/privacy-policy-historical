_1\. General Browsing:_

BathandBodyWorks.com gathers navigational information about where visitors go on our Web site and information about the technical efficiencies of our Web site and services (i.e., time to connect to our Web site, time to download pages, etc.). This information allows us to see which areas of our Web site are most visited and helps us better understand our visitors' experiences at BathandBodyWorks.com. With the navigational information, we can improve the quality of our Web site by recognizing and delivering more of the features, areas and services our visitors prefer. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding a visitor's use of our Web site (such as the time of a visitor's last visit to a page on our site).

_2\. Collection of Personal Information:_

BathandBodyWorks.com (and its microsites) may ask you to provide personal information when you establish or update a BathandBodyWorks.com Account, sign up for Bath and Body Works email, enter a contest, participate in a survey, submit information to be posted on the website if compliant with rules and terms of use (such as product reviews, Customer Conversation request or answer, Stories and related photos or video), shop online (including the purchase of an Egift card), register to receive a free gift, check the status of an order, contact us, purchase and send a gift card or an Egift card and/or create or send a wish list, gift reminder, or product description.

Categories of information collected online include name, billing and shipping address, email address, recipient's name, phone number and email address, order information, telephone number, credit card information, gift card information, your experience on this Web site or with our products, your photograph or video, your questions, responses, messages, reminders or stories you create. If you create a BathandBodyWorks.com Account, you will be required to provide your email address and a password and may provide additional personal information such as name, billing and shipping address and credit card number.

We will use the services of YAHOO! mapping if you want specific directions to one of our stores. If you use the store locator on our Web site to obtain driving directions, you will be providing your mailing address to our service provider.

BathandBodyWorks.com uses the personal information we collect from you: (i) to deliver products that you have ordered; (ii) to process your request and send the requested gift card(s) or Egift card(s); (iii) to fulfill requests that you have created; (iv) to contact you or the product recipient(s) in the event of order or delivery difficulties, for verification purposes; (v) to respond to your inquiries; (vi) to develop our products and deliver information to you about our services, products, promotions or Web site, including (if you have not opted-out) adding you to the Bath and Body Works email list and the Bath and Body Works mailing list; and (vii) to enter you in online contests and sweepstakes that may be offered from time to time.

If you have a BathandBodyWorks.com Account you may save personal information in that Account, such as name, shipping and billing addresses, and credit card information, and we will access this saved information to make your shopping quicker and easier. We require you to create and/or access your Account to use various services on the Web site, such as Order Status, Wish List, and creating a product review. Because you must create or access your BathandBodyWorks.com Account prior to using these services, it is possible that we could associate you with the information you provide through these services.

The information you include in a Wish List, product review, Customer Conversation or Story may be used by us to send you information about the types of products in which you have indicated an interest. The information you provide when using the Order Status feature on our Web site is only used to assist you in tracking your shopping order(s). Because some of our surveys require you to provide self-identifying information, we may use information you provide to us in survey responses to enhance and personalize our product offerings to you.

If you purchase a gift card after August 9, 2004, we will add your email address to the BathandBodyWorks.com email marketing list, which is used as noted below in "Bath and Body Works Email". If you purchased a gift card prior to August 9, 2004 and indicated when ordering your gift card(s) that you would like to receive emails from BathandBodyWorks.com regarding product information and sales alerts, you were added to our email marketing list. If you purchase an Egift card, we will add your name and email address to the BathandBodyWorks.com email marketing list. If you have us send an Egift card to another person, we will not add the recipient's information to our email marketing list. However, it is possible that the recipient has separately signed up for email or purchased from us and is included in the BathandBodyWorks.com email marketing list.

Bath and Body Works email allows you to receive exclusive information about special offers, media events, new products and much more. If you're not already registered, simply complete our [sign up](http://www.bathandbodyworks.com/emailSignup/index.jsp) form to receive these special messages. If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of Bath and Body Works email, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each message. Asking to be removed from Bath and Body Works email will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at BathandBodyWorks.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products or other operational email communications. 

BathandBodyWorks.com does not sell, rent or trade your email address to unaffiliated companies (those companies in which we or our parent have no ownership interest). We may share our email marketing list (and, thus, your email address), with our affiliated "sister" companies (for example, Express, The Limited, Victoria's Secret, etc.). Our sister companies' emails, like ours, provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of future emails from them. We may occasionally provide you with the opportunity on our site to opt-in to receive email messages from unaffiliated third parties. If you do opt-in we will share your email address with the specific unaffiliated third party with whom you have opted-in to receive email messages

We will use third parties to help us provide services to you and to give us comparative information on the performance of our site and our microsites. These services include such things as operating our Web site, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, processing shopping, gift card and Egift card orders, maintaining our database, processing product reviews, Customer Conversations and Stories (including photographs and videos submitted with Stories) and administering and monitoring emails, surveys, drawings or contests. Third party service providers may also assist us in offering, running and monitoring microsites where you will provide personal information about yourself and possibly about your friends. The microsites may also include a means for you to access and download information from your existing email address books through the service provider so you can more easily share our offers with your friends. Third parties assisting us with microsites may only use personal information collected on those sites for the purpose of providing services for us and you.

BathandBodyWorks.com may use third parties or on its own conduct various surveys to better understand your experience with our Web site. In some cases you will provide self-identifying information, in which case we would then be able to associate your responses to you. In other cases we will only receive the aggregate results (not personally identifiable) from these third parties. If you participate in an online survey at our Web site that is conducted by a third party provider, you may be asked to download a small software application and the information you provide may be subject to the third party provider's linked privacy policy. You should read any such linked privacy policy before you participate in the online survey. You may also choose to not participate in the online surveys with linked third party privacy policies. 

If you choose to write a product review, submit an inquiry or response for a Customer Conversation or submit a Story (along with a photograph and video) you will be providing it to a third party who we use to process these submissions. Product reviews, inquiries and responses to Customer Conversations and Stories (and photographs and videos, if submitted) that comply with the Review Rules may be published on this Web site, and some may be published in our stores, emails, online marketing and/or catalogs. Published reviews, Conversations and Stories (and photographs and videos, if submitted) will identify the author's nickname, location, responses and/or images in photographs or videos (if submitted by you and compliant with the rules and terms of use). 

If you sign up for anything on our Web site where you provide your name, mailing address and phone number, such information will be added to a database. In addition, if you purchase a product or an Egift card on our Web site, the information you provide (for example, name, mailing address, phone, credit card number) will be added to the same database. If you purchase a gift card on our Web site after May 14, 2004, the information you provide (for example, name, mailing address, credit card number) will be added to the same database. The information in this database is used to provide names and mailing addresses to other companies, sometimes categorized by purchase information. Our affiliated companies (for example, Express, The Limited, Victoria's Secret, etc.) also have access to this database. If you would prefer that we not share your name and mailing address with unaffiliated companies (other than third party service providers), please call us at 800-887-2298. 

There is a possibility that Bath and Body Works could merge with, acquire, or be acquired by another business entity. If such an action occurs, some or all of the personal information collected about you would be shared with this entity, as well as retained by Bath and Body Works. 

You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Web site, the site or the public.

_3\. How do third parties use cookies on our site?_

We carefully select third party advertising companies and allow them to collect non-personally identifiable information by placing cookies when you choose to visit and when you visit BathandBodyWorks.com. These selected companies may use information (not including your name, address, credit card information, email address, or telephone number) about your choice to visit and your visits to our site and other Web sites to provide advertisements about Bath and Body Works' products and services on this and other Web sites. These selected companies also provide information to us which we use to gauge the effectiveness of the advertisements they place about our products and services and for marketing purposes. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about no longer having information from these third party cookies used by these companies or provided to us, [click here.](http://www.networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp)

Third party service providers who assist us in running and monitoring microsites will use cookies on these microsites and pixel tags in the emails sent from the microsites to assist us in conducting and monitoring the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns and, in the future, to possibly provide you with enhanced features and content. Cookies and pixel tags will also be used by these third parties to monitor and provide information about participation in sweepstakes or events promoted on our microsites to us and the friend who provided you the connection to the microsite in the following situations: if you receive an invitation to such a sweepstakes or event from a friend and accept the invitation, or if you click on a link located on a friend's social networking page that takes you to a sweepstakes or event on one of our microsites. 

Coremetrics: We have also selected a company, Coremetrics, that will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf. The collection of data on our site by Coremetrics is done through first-party data collection.

Coremetrics is required to maintain all information collected and its analysis in confidence.

As a visitor to BathandBodyWorks.com, you have the option to deactivate the ability of Coremetrics to analyze your browsing behavior on our site or when our site sends you product offers by email.

BathandBodyWorks.com has implemented the following security measures to protect the information we have collected at our Web site: use of technologies and policies such as limited access data-centers, firewall technology, and limitations of administrative access to our systems. In addition, it is our policy not to send your credit card number via email. In fact, this is a practice we encourage you to adopt in all of your Internet activities. We designed BathandBodyWorks.com to accept shopping orders only from Web browsers that permit communication through Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology; for example, 5.0 versions or higher of Internet Explorer.
