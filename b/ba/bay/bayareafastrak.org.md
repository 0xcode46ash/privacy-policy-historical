# FasTrak® - Keeping the Bay Area Moving

This Privacy Policy describes the collection, use and security of the information obtained from users of the FasTrak® system for the efficient and effective operations of the program. This policy is consistent with Federal and State laws governing an individual’s rights to privacy.

**Personal Information Collected**  
BATA collects personal information to facilitate enrollment processing, account maintenance and to better serve FasTrak® accounts. Examples of personal information include a FasTrak® users name, address, telephone number, email address, credit card number and expiration date, license plate number or other information that personally identifies a FasTrak® user. BATA obtains this personal information from applications or other forms submitted to BATA. BATA may also obtain information about a FasTrak® user from other sources, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV), to ensure that records are correct and complete.

**How Personal Information is Used**  
Personal information will only be used by BATA, the Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District (GGBHTD), and the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) for the purpose of administering a FasTrak® user’s account and managing the FasTrak® operations. In the course of administering FasTrak® accounts, BATA may disclose personal information to third party service providers for the purpose of operating the FasTrak® program (e.g., DMV, municipal courts, account processors or collection agencies); otherwise, personal information will not be disclosed to third parties, except as required by law or ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. Information about a FasTrak® user’s use of the system, but which does not personally identify a user, may be disclosed to others to generate statistical reports for the purpose of managing the FasTrak® operation. 

**Security**  
BATA will take all reasonable steps to safeguard personal information through physical, electronic and procedural means. BATA will treat FasTrak® user information confidentially and require third party service providers to treat it in the same manner.

FasTrak® users retain the right to review and edit all of their personal information pertaining to their accounts, whether stored electronically or on paper. Personal information can be reviewed and edited online at <http://www.bayareafastrak.org/dynamic/accounts/index.shtml>. Any inquiry or request to obtain information, in accordance with the above provisions, should be directed in writing to the FasTrak® Customer Service Center or to BATA. BATA may adopt procedures for review of such information, including but not limited to charging a fee for processing requests for access to personal information.

**Effective Date**  
The effective date of this privacy policy is May 25, 2005. If BATA makes changes to this privacy policy, BATA will post the revised policy on its FasTrak® website, including the date of any amendments.
