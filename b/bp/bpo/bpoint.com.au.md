# Privacy Policy - How we handle your personal information - CommBank

**Can I get access to my information?**

You can ask for access to your basic information (for example what transactions you’ve made) by visiting a branch, going online or calling us. To obtain a copy of current credit-related information we hold about you, you can visit a branch or call us.  


For more substantial information, such as details of what is recorded in your loan file, please complete and sign the [Request for Access to Personal Information](https://web.archive.org/content/dam/commbank/security-privacy/request-for-access-to-personal-information.pdf) form included at the end of this Policy. Send it to us using the contact details in section 10.  


**Is there a fee?**

There is no fee for making the initial request, but in some cases there may be an access charge to cover the time we spend locating, compiling and explaining the information you ask for. If there is an access charge, we’ll give you an estimate up front and confirm that you’d like us to proceed. Generally, the access charge is based on an hourly rate plus any photocopying costs or other out-of-pocket expenses. You’ll need to make the payment before we start, unless you’ve authorised us to debit your account.

**How long does it take to gain access to my information?**

We try to make your information available within 30 days of your request. Before we give you the information, we’ll need to confirm your identity.  


**Can you deny or limit my request for access?**

In certain circumstances we’re allowed to deny your request, or limit the access we provide. For example we might not provide you access to commercially sensitive information. Whatever the outcome, we’ll write to you explaining our decision.  


**Updating your basic information**

It’s important that we have your correct details, such as your current address and telephone number. You can check or update your information at any branch, or by going online or phoning us. Please see section 10.

**Can I correct my information?**  


You can ask us to correct any inaccurate information we hold or have provided to others (including credit-related information) by contacting us using the details in section 10. If the information that is corrected is information we have provided to others, you can ask us to notify them of the correction. We don’t charge a fee for these requests.

If your request relates to credit-related information provided by others, we may need to consult with credit reporting bodies or other credit providers. We’ll try to correct information within 30 days. If we can’t complete the request within 30 days, we’ll let you know the reason for the delay and try to agree a timeframe with you to extend the period.

If we’re able to correct your information, we’ll inform you when the process is complete.  


**What if we disagree that the information should be corrected?**  


If we disagree with you that information should be corrected, we’ll let you know in writing our reasons. You can ask us to include a statement with the relevant information, indicating your view that the information is inaccurate, misleading, incomplete, irrelevant or out-of-date. We will take reasonable steps to comply with such a request.
