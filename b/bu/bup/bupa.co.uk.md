We may amend this privacy and cookie policy from time to time. New versions will be posted on this website, with an updated version number and date displayed at the top of this page. You should check this site from time to time to see if there have been any changes.

By using this website and/or providing your data and/or information, you consent to the use of your data and information as described and/or referred to in this privacy and cookie policy.

Sometimes you may decide to submit personal information which is of a more private nature, which we refer to as sensitive personal information.
