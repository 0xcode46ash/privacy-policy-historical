# Bundle Privacy Policy

Bundle Corporation (“Bundle”, “us” or “we”) is dedicated to maintaining your trust and confidence in the protection of the personal information that you disclose through Bundle.com (the “Website”). Safeguarding this information is Bundle’s utmost priority, a non-negotiable promise from us to you. This disclosure is intended to explain how your personally identifiable information may be collected, handled and disclosed.

### What information do we collect and track?

We may request personal information when you upload information, post content, register for a product or service, download information, answer a survey, correspond with us, correspond with others or engage in certain other activities on or through our Website. The types of information we collect may vary depending on the nature of the activity in which you are engaged. The information you store with us relating to your financial accounts are your private and personal information. You make the decision whether to proceed with any activity that requests personal information. If you do not wish to provide the requested information, however, you may not be able to complete the activity. 

The only other information we automatically collect is information related to the use of our Websites, such as:

  1. General information when you log in:  Internet domain (for example, "xcompany.com" or "yourschool.edu"); Internet Protocol (IP) address; operating system; the browser used to access our Web site; files downloaded; the date and time you access our site; the pages that you visited; and the responses to any surveys that you complete. 
  2. Referral and statistical information where we have links or ad banners.  Such data may include aggregate data such as the number of click-throughs that occurred. It may also include specific data, such as whether you are a repeat visitor; whether you viewed or clicked on an ad banner and used our site, and the identity of the site which you linked to from Bundle.com or from which you were linked to Bundle.com. We do not use such data to identify you personally.
  3. Some of our pages use a feature of your browser called a “cookie.” Cookies, by themselves, are not able to extract any personal information from you. This cookie automatically identifies your computer - but not you - to our servers when you visit our site. Unless you specifically tell us, we will never know who you are, even though we may assign your computer a cookie. Also, our web sites can only read cookies created by our web sites. Cookies allow us to personalize our site for you and to provide you with information that fits your needs and desires.
  4. If you allow us access to an account that you have with another service provider, we may ask you to allow us to access your information from that service provider (such as your name, your picture, and other personally identifiable information that you may have stored with that service provider).



### How do we use the information? 

We use personally identifiable information in the following ways: 

  1. To provide you with information about product upgrades, new products, services, newsletters and informative emails;
  2. To assist us in creating content that is relevant to you or that you have directed us to create;
  3. To provide you with special offers that may be of interest to you and to improve your experience on our Web site;
  4. To assist us in creating better products and services to meet your needs;
  5. To allow you to purchase and download products, obtain access to services or otherwise engage in activities you select;
  6. To identify your postings and the content that you upload to and the information that you download from the Website;
  7. To help you quickly find software, services or product information important to you.



### How do we protect your information?

We protect this information by maintaining robust physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards. These include: 

The Website has retained a secure environment available at a third-party site, where security personnel monitor the system 24 hours a day. Access to servers requires multiple levels of authentication.

The Website’s secure network infrastructure includes the following components: 

Firewall architecture  
Data encryption  
Virus protection  
Intrusion Detection  


In addition, we train our employees in the proper handling of personal information. When we use other companies to provide services for us, we require them to protect the confidentiality of personal information they receive.

### When can we disclose your information?

Except as described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy, we will not use your personal information without your consent. 

We do not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide the products or services you have requested or purchased and to comply with your posting or content uploading and forwarding activities.

We may use such information to respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or establish and exercise our legal rights and defend against legal claims.

We may use such information if we believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal or improper activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

### Other Web Sites

This Privacy Policy applies only to the Website.  We do not exercise control over the sites maintained by third parties even if related to our service. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. We encourage you to read their privacy statements, as they may differ from ours. 

### Privacy Policy Changes

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. The effective date of this policy, as stated above, indicates the last time this policy was revised or materially changed. Checking the effective date above allows you to determine whether there have been changes since the last time you reviewed the policy. Regardless, we will post any Policy changes on this page and, if the changes are significant, we may provide a more prominent notice.
