If you are a subscriber of the Xbox Live service, your gamertag, nicknames and statistics such as high scores may be displayed on Bungie.net; and your online presence will be visible to those on your Xbox Live friends list. You will also have the opportunity to link your Xbox Live gamertag to your Passport Network account so that your experience can be personalized and so that you will have access to additional features.
