******Data Protection Policy Statement**

DFL Deutsche Fußball Liga GmbH, Guiollettstr. 44-46, D-60325 Frankfurt am Main **("DFL")** collects, processes, and uses personal data, which has been captured from visits to the websites www.bundesliga.de and www.bundesliga.com (collectively the **"website"** ) in compliance with the applicable data protection provisions of the Federal Republic of Germany. This Data Protection Policy Statement sets out which visitor **("user")** data is captured on the website and how this information is processed and used.

## 1\. Personal data 

  
Personal data is all data containing information about the personal or material circumstances of an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, name, email address, home address, phone number, or date of birth.

## 2\. Data collection, processing, and use when the website is accessed over the Internet

  
Each time a user accesses the website, the user's Internet browser - for technical reasons - automatically supplies the following data to DFL's web server:

  * IP address of the computer  

  * date and time of access  

  * name and URL of file downloaded  

  * amount of data transmitted  

  * access status (file transmitted, file not found, etc.)  

  * data identifying Internet browser software and operating system used  

  * name of Internet access provider of user  

  * website from which the access was made.

  
The collection, processing, and use of this information is solely for the purpose of enabling the use of the website (connection set-up), system security, and technical administration of the network infrastructure. No comparison with other datasets or any transfer of the collected data to third parties, even partial transfer, is carried out.

With regard to data collection, processing, and use for the purpose of optimizing the website through web analytics and the creation of user profiles, additional reference is made to Section 4 of this Data Protection Policy Statement.  
.

## 3\. Data collection, processing, and use within the scope of the services offered on the website

  
The use of certain services on the website, such as the newsletter or the football tip game, requires prior registration, including the submission of personal data (name, residential address, telecommunications data, etc.) by the user.

The collection, processing and use of personal data is carried out solely for the purpose of allowing users to select the necessary information and services, and only in the manner and extent to which the user has given prior express consent. 

Any further use of such personal data for the purpose of sending additional product and service offerings, especially by DFL's cooperation partners, only takes place if the user has given prior express consent. The user can revoke consent at any time with effect for the future.

## 4\. Data collection, processing, and use in the context of web analytics, creation of user profiles and measuring range

  


## 4.1 Web analysis and production of user profiles by AT Internet

  
On its website, DFL uses a web analytics service called 'AnalyzerNX Web Edition', which is run by APPLIED INTERNET TECHNOLOGIES GmbH **("AT Internet")** , a company authorised by DFL pursuant to Section 11 of the Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz). Technology from AT Internet is used on the website to collect and process the following data for the purpose of analyzing and processing user behavior:

  * the IP address of the computer contacting the website, which is shortened by the last digits, anonymized and additionally converted into a hash value  

  * the time, number and duration of accesses  

  * the place of access (the state in Germany is the lowest level)  

  * connection speed  

  * the click behaviour of the website   

  * page views (page impressions)



A user profile under a pseudonym is created with this data.

Cookies may be used for this purpose. Cookies are small text files that are stored locally in the cache of the user's Internet browser. The cookies enable subsequent visits to the website to be identified. Users can configure their Internet browser in such a way as to reject or delete cookies directly. DFL draws your attention to the fact that this configuration may mean that the features of the website may not be fully usable in some circumstances.

Without the separately issued, express consent of the user, no data collected using Internet AT technology will be used to identify the user personally, nor will it be combined with any personal data relating to the holder of the pseudonym. The user may object to the collection and processing of data for web analytics and creation of user profiles under the following link at any time and with effect for the future by setting up an opt-out cookie.

## 4.2 Web analysis for targeted, group appropriate fade-in of online advertising

  
An application from the company nugg.ad AG is used to direct advertising fade-ins on the website. This application helps to analyze the user behavior in order to be able to fade in advertising tailored to the user s interests (so-called "predictive behavior targeting”). Anonymized user data is collected for this purpose and compared with already existing data from polling, e.g., concerning socio-demography or product interests. 

Cookies are used to collect user data anonymously. It is not possible to draw conclusions about personal data of the user by means of cookies. Furthermore, the user can configure the settings of the user s internet browser so that cookies are rejected or directly deleted.

In any event, the user can object to the anonymized collection of user data for directing advertising fade-ins under the nugg.ad application by setting an opt-out cookie at any time with effect for the future under the following [**link**](http://www.ip-deutschland.de/material/targeting/targeting_opt.html).

## 4.3 Range measurement with "scalable central measurement procedure”

  
DFL also uses the so-called scalable central measurement procedure (SCM) of INFOnline GmbH which has been retained by the DFL in accordance with § 11 German Data Protection Act in order to statistically measure the use of the DFL website (range measurement). Anonymous measurement values are collected for this purpose in order to statistically determine the use intensity and the number of users of the website. 

In the course of this range measurement, a cookie with the designation "ivwbox.de" is normally used to identify the inquiring computer. The cookie receives a random, internally issued sequence of numbers which cannot be attributed to any specific person and is instead issued anonymously. The validity of the cookie is limited to one year. 

If the user s internet browser does not permit cookies, an identification number with the designation "signature" is created on the basis of an anonymized IP address created by cutting off its last numbers and the used internet browser. The complete IP address is not stored and instead even the anonymized IP address is immediately deleted after processing. Furthermore, encryption prevents any conclusion about the identity of the user from being derived from the identification number. 

The use statistics are provided to website operators which are members of the Information Association for the Determination of the Distribution of Advertising Media (Informationsgemeinschaft zur Feststellung der Verbreitung von Werbeträgern e.V.) ("IVW” - www.ivw.eu) or which participate in the study "internet facts" of the Online Research Working Group (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Online-Forschung e.V.) ("AGOF" - www.agof.de), and the user statistics are published monthly by AGOF and the Working Group for Media Analysis (Arbeitsgemeinschaft Media-Analyse e.V.) as well as IVW. Anyone can review the statistics at http://www.agof.de, http://www.agma-mmc.de and http://www.ivw.eu. The DFL is a member of IVW and participates in the study "internet facts" of AGOF. 

The user can object to the collection, processing and use of data for range measurement under the SCM at any time with effect for the future by setting an opt-out cookie at the following [**link**](http://optout.ivwbox.de/).

## 5\. Purpose of processing and use of personal data

  
Any processing or use of your personal data is only for the purposes stated in this Data Protection Policy Statement and only to the extent necessary to achieve the respective purposes.

Personal data will not be published by DFL, nor will it be passed on to third parties without authorization.

Transmission of personal data to government institutions and authorities will only be carried out within the framework of mandatory national legislation or if the transmission is necessary for legal or law enforcement purposes as a result of attacks on the network infrastructure.

## 6\. Retention and deletion of personal data

  
As soon as it is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected or as soon as the user requests so, all personal data stored and all pseudonymized use data will be directly and irretrievably deleted; this will be the case, provided that the DFL is not under a statutory duty to store the data. If the DFL is under a statutory duty to store the data, the stored personal information and the pseudonymized use data will be permanently deleted upon expiry of the relevant statutory retention periods.

## 7\. Security

  
The DFL uses technical and organizational security measures to protect the personal data of users from accidental or intentional manipulation, loss, destruction, or access by unauthorized persons. These security measures are continually being updated in line with technological developments.

## 8\. Links to other websites

  
The website may contain links to other websites. This Data Protection Policy Statement applies solely to the website of DFL. The DFL has no influence over, and does not control whether other providers comply with applicable data protection provisions.

## 9\. Right of information, rectification, blocking, or deletion of data

  
Users of the website have a right to receive information with regard to the personal data collected concerning them. They also have a right to rectification of inaccurate data, as well as blocking, or deletion of data. To contact DFL, please use the contact form that can be obtained at the following link: <http://bundesliga.de/en/kontakt.php>

## 10\. Acceptance, validity, and timeliness of the Data Protection Policy Statement

  
By using the website, the user agrees to the collection, processing, and use of his/her data, as described in this Data Protection Policy Statement. This Data Protection Policy Statement is currently valid and dated as of 1 January 2012. DFL reserves the right to change this Data Protection Policy Statement at any time as needed with effect for the future, especially in order to adapt it to the further development of the website or the implementation of new technologies.
