Thanks for your interest in Buncee LLC’s online and mobile services. Before signing up at buncee.com or buncee’s mobile apps we request that you read and accept our User Agreement which consists of this Privacy Policy (Policy) and our Terms and Conditions (Terms). This Policy explains what personal information we collect, why we collect it, and how it is used. If you have any questions regarding this Policy or the Terms, please contact us at privacy@buncee.com. 

## Information Collection & User Registration

  


In order to use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form and create a username and password. During registration, you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address), gender, and date of birth. We will use your contact information to contact you about the services on our site in which you have expressed interest.

Buncee LLC is the sole owner of Buncee.com and any information collected on Buncee.com, which collects personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information, including name, email, shipping address, and financial information such as credit card number and expiration date.

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. When you place an order, you will receive an email from us.

Surveys or Contests: From time-to-time, we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Therefore, you have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as zip code).

We will communicate with you through email and notices posted on the Buncee.com website, or through other means available through the service, including mobile text messages. We may send you a series of emails that help inform new Users about the features of the service, and we will also send you service messages relating to the functioning of the Services. We may also send you messages with promotional information directly or on behalf of our partners, unless you have opted out of receiving promotional information.

Many communications you initiate through Buncee.com (e.g. an invitation sent to a non-User) will list your primary email address and the name of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide aggregate information about your network (for instance how many people are in your network), but will not list the people to whom you’re directly connected. Other communications that you initiate through the Buncee.com website, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator, but will not include your personal email address contact information. Your contact information will only be shared with another User if both of you have indicated that you would like to establish contact with each other.
