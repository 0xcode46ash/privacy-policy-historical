# Privacy — business.govt.nz

We have a number of different tools available on our site, including our Business calendar, Compliance Matters and the Employment Agreement Builder.

### Business.govt.nz calendar

Please note that the business.govt.nz calendar is a service provided by Trumba Corporation (Trumba). If you choose to use the Event Actions function in the calendar, for example to subscribe to a calendar, request calendar reminders, or download calendar information, you may be prompted by Trumba to provide personal information such as your name and email address. Personal information provided to Trumba is subject to the Trumba Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.

When you use Trumba Events Actions you consent to the Trumba Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions of Use.

### Compliance Matters

The Compliance Matters tool requires users to provide an email address to save an action list and send reminders. Business.govt.nz does not collect or store these email addresses. Some browsers may auto fill an email address previously entered if the cache has not been cleared but this is not related to any action by business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the Compliance Matters tool including information on items saved to action lists. This information is not associated with individuals and cannot be traced back to an email address used to save an action list.

### Employee Cost Calculator

The Employee Cost Calculator tool requires users to provide an email address to email their calculation results. Business.govt.nz does not collect or store these email addresses. Some browsers may auto fill an email address previously entered if the cache has not been cleared but this is not related to any action by business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the Employee Cost Calculator tool including information on refinements made by users to the calculation results.  This information is not associated with individuals and cannot be traced back to an email address used to save an action list.

### Employment Agreement Builder

The Employment Agreement Builder (EAB) tool requires users to send their completed agreements to a secure email address. Users will also be asked for an email address if they start an employment agreement and intend to finish it at a later date. These email addresses will be used to send users a link to return to their draft agreement.

Business.govt.nz will temporarily store this email address until the agreement has been completed. Once the user completes their employment agreement, their email address will be permanently deleted from business.govt.nz.

In the event that a user does not complete an employment agreement, private information, eg employer and employee names, will be automatically deleted. Users will have to retype these fields when they return to their draft agreement. Any draft agreement that hasn’t been reopened in 90 days will be automatically deleted.

Once a user has completed their employment agreement, all information will be permanently deleted from business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the EAB tool. This information is not associated with individuals and cannot be traced back to an email address used to create an agreement.

### Self-assessment tools

Before displaying a user’s results, the self-assessment tools ask for some anonymous information about the user’s business, including:

  * industry
  * number of people employed
  * how long the business has been operating.



If a user wants to save their results and come back to them later, business.govt.nz collects their email address to send a link to the results — and offers the option to sign up to two separate newsletters. This email address will only be used again by business.govt.nz if the user subscribes to one or both newsletters. Note the email addresses of users who save their results but do not subscribe to a newsletter are retained by a secure third party system, and will not be further accessed or used by MBIE.

Users have the right to ask for a copy of any personal information business.govt.nz holds about them, and to ask for it to be corrected if it is wrong or out of date. To do this, email [info@business.govt.nz](mailto:info@business.govt.nz).

###  Workplace Policy Builder

The Workplace Policy Builder (WPB) tool requires users to send their completed workplace policy to a secure email address. Users will also be asked for an email address if they start a workplace policy and intend to finish it at a later date. These email addresses will be used to send users a link to return to their draft workplace policy.

Business.govt.nz will temporarily store this email address until the workplace policy has been completed. Once the user completes their workplace policy, their email address will be permanently deleted from business.govt.nz.

In the event that a user does not complete their workplace policy users will have to retype these fields when they return to their draft agreement. Any draft workplace policy that hasn’t been reopened in 90 days will be automatically deleted.

Once a user has completed their workplace policy, all information will be permanently deleted from business.govt.nz.

MBIE will be collecting statistics from the WPB tool. This information is not associated with individuals and cannot be traced back to an email address used to create a workplace policy.
