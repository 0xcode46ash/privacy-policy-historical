## Call recording

As part of our commitment to providing the best possible service to our customers we record all telephone calls answered in our contact centre. This helps us to identify ways that we can provide you with a better service.

We record calls:

  * for staff training purposes, helping us to improve the quality of our customer service and to ensure the information we provide is consistent and accurate;
  * so we can find ways to simplify our service to you; and
  * to ensure we have an accurate record of your call, which may be needed to support any transactions that take place over the phone and/or if there is a dispute.



We understand your personal information is important to you, and we are committed to protecting your privacy. We store the recordings securely for two years and destroy them after this period.

Unless we have lawful reason for withholding this information, it will be made available if you request access to a transcript of your call by phoning 0508 266 726 and asking for the Privacy Officer.
