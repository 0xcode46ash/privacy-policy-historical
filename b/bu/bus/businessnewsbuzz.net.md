Please note that the Netcog Network contains links to other sites and occasionally allows other sites to be co-branded with the Netcog name. While we endeavor to ensure that the privacy policy of each site conforms to our own, Netcog cannot represent or guarantee that they do so. Bear in mind that such sites that are linked to Netcog Network sites, or carry the Netcog brand for co-branding or marketing purposes, may have privacy policies which differ from that of the Netcog Network. 

The Netcog Network will update this policy from time to time so please check back periodically. When such changes occur, you will see the word "updated" next to the Privacy Policy link on the front page of each site on the Netcog Network. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will prominently post such changes prior to implementing them. 

  Our goal is to become your favorite Internet destination by providing the information, services, and product offerings that are most relevant to you. To achieve this goal, the Netcog Network must collect information so we can understand what makes you different from our many other unique users. 

Information collected online is usually defined as being either **anonymous** or **personally identifiable**.

****
  * **Anonymous information** refers to data that cannot be tied back to a specific individual. For example, Netcog collects some information each time a visitor comes to a Netcog Network site so we can improve the overall quality of the visitor's online experience. Netcog collects the visitor's IP address (e.g., whether the user is logged on from ibm.com or a Free Internet Access), referral data (e.g., the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to a Netcog Network site), and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). Netcog also collects aggregate search terms from its search services for internal reporting and targeted advertising. Netcog collects this user information for purposes of product monitoring, product improvement, and targeted advertising. You do not have to register with the Netcog Network before we can collect this anonymous information.

****
  * **Personally identifiable information** refers to data that tells us specifically who you are, such as your name and postal address, which may be collected in addition to the anonymous data described above. Netcog collects personal information in the following ways from different parts of our network of Web sites:

  | 

****
  1. **Netcog Network Registration:** You are sharing personally identifiable information with Netcog when you register to use one or more sites on the Netcog Network. If you choose to register --and we hope you do-- you may provide Netcog with your name, postal address, e-mail address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, telephone number, occupation, marital status and other information. While not all of this data is required for our services to function, we are better able to customize your experience if you volunteer complete and accurate information. Netcog finds that users who personalize their experience come back more often. Users who complete the registration process are given a Netcog Network ID and can take full advantage of the many offerings across the Netcog Network, including personalization services. For example, My Netcog uses your network ID to give you customized news and information. ****
  2. **Other Registration:** In addition to registration for various services on the Netcog Network, we may ask you for personal information at other times, including when you enter a sweepstakes, contest or promotion sponsored by the Netcog Network. The number and variety of useful services on the Netcog Network will continue to grow in the future. You are not required to register for any services on the Netcog Network. (This is true of any site on the Internet.) If you choose not to provide the requested information, the Netcog Network may not be able to offer you some of the personalized services that depend on this type of information to function. ****
  3. **Correspondence:** If you contact the Netcog Network, we may keep a record of that correspondence. We do not collect any e-mail addresses of those who communicate with the Netcog Network via e-mail. We use the information provided so that we may respond to the e-mail. The customer contact information is also used to contact  a visitor when necessary.

  
---|---  
  
  In addition to the personally identifiable information that Netcog actively collects when you register, we also collect anonymous information passively using **cookies**. Presently, cookies play an important role in making the Internet work, but there is much confusion among Internet users about what cookies are and how they are used. 

A cookie is a small text file containing a unique identification number that is transferred from a Web site to the hard drive of your computer so that the site administrator may identify your computer and passively track its activities on the Web site. This unique number identifies your Web browser --but not you-- to Netcog computers whenever you visit one of the sites in the Netcog Network. A cookie will not let a Web site know any personally identifiable information about you, such as your real name and address.

Netcog uses cookies designed to let us know which particular computer you are using, but nothing more. Netcog is not generally interested in any one individual and does not collect personally identifiable information about any one person using cookies. Since cookies are only text files, they cannot run like a program on your computer, search your computer for other information, or transmit any information to anyone.

To help serve you better, Netcog generally uses cookies to:

****
  * **Remember your Web browser** so we can offer and provide personalized services such as My Netcog membership. We use cookies to store and sometimes track information about where a Web browser has visited on our Network of sites.

****
  * **Save your passwords and preferences** so that you will not have to re-enter them the next time you visit.

****
  * **Enhance Netcog Shopping** by allowing merchants to track business at their stores and process orders in individual shopping carts.

****
  * **Measure traffic patterns.** Without cookies, it could be difficult for Netcog to know which services are more popular than others. This information helps us to better understand when to launch new services.

****
  * **Estimate audience size.** Cookies let us know whether or not a Web browser has seen a particular display, including advertising, so we do not bore you with the same material over and over again.

****
  * **Display advertisements.** Third-party advertising networks for Netcog (like DoubleClick/Sonar) may issue cookies when serving advertisements. Click [here](http://www.sonar.com/content/privacy.htm) for information on our relationship with DoubleClick/Sonar.



The use of cookies is now an industry standard, and they are currently used on most major Web sites. Most Web browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can reset your browser to notify you when you have received a cookie. You can also refuse to accept cookies altogether. While Netcog does not require you to use cookies, keep in mind that certain sites and services will not function properly if you set your browser to refuse all cookies.

  When you register for a service within the Netcog Network, that information is generally collected and maintained solely by the Netcog Network unless specifically stated otherwise at the point of collection. For example, some Netcog Network services (like Auctions) are offered in conjunction with a third-party company. If data is collected and/or maintained by any company other than Netcog, we will tell you at the point of collection. If you do not want to share your information with that company, you can choose not to use that service. Please see the Section entitled With whom does the Netcog Network share the information that is collected? for a more complete list of companies that allow Netcog to provide you with a wide variety of Products and Services. 

Netcog runs many promotions and sweepstakes across its Network. These promotions may be sponsored or co-sponsored by third-party companies. Data collected during a promotion is typically shared with the sponsor or co-sponsor. Netcog will inform you at the point of collection whether or not we are sharing your personal data as a result of your participation in a promotion or sweepstakes. If you do not want to have the Netcog Network share your data, you can choose not to participate in the promotion or sweepstakes.

Be aware that Netcog Network sponsors and other advertisers have links on our sites that take you to other sites that may collect personally identifiable information about you. Netcog hopes that all third parties involved adhere to our policies regarding the privacy of our users. However, the Netcog Network Privacy Policy does not cover third-party data collection practices and the Netcog Network does not assume any responsibility for any actions of third parties.

Any personally identifiable information you share with Netcog when registering for Products and Services at any of our Network sites is maintained and accessible only by Netcog unless specifically stated otherwise. Netcog requests information from its users so that users can enjoy customized experiences across the Netcog Network, including personalization services, interactive communications and much more. Most of these Products and Services are available to you at no cost. In order to provide great content and services free of charge, Netcog displays advertisements. 

The following are examples of how the Netcog Network may use the information it collects:

  * Netcog offers its users the ability to personalize content on the Network, such as news, custom home page design, newsletters, email alerts and more.


  * Netcog uses the aggregate data collected to let our sponsors know the numbers of people who have certain demographic characteristics and the number of those people who have seen and "clicked" on their advertisement(s). We will also disclose to those third-party sponsors the overall demographics available regarding who saw and "clicked" on their advertisement. No personally identifiable information will be disclosed to these advertisers as part of this process -- only information in an aggregate form.


  * Netcog also uses the aggregate data to perform statistical analyses of the collective characteristics and behavior of our registered users and visitors, to measure user demographics and interests regarding specific areas of the Netcog Network and to analyze how and where best to use our resources. Without such data, we would not know which parts of the Netcog Network are the most popular, and we would not be able to change and update the content and services appropriately.


  * Netcog may, from time to time, use your information to contact you about changes or enhancements to Products and Services on the Netcog Network.


  * If you told Netcog that you were interested in receiving offers or information from selected sponsors and advertisers, Netcog will send you e-mail about products and services that we feel may be of interest to you. For those who elect to receive such materials from Netcog or third parties, and who indicate that they do in their profile, Netcog will release personally identifiable information. Information released includes name, e-mail address and other information supplied in the Netcog Network registration process.


  * Netcog sometimes uses an individual registered user's data to "pre-populate" forms that are displayed for the purpose of collecting individual data by the Netcog Network and/or its advertisers and sponsors.


  * If you enter a sweepstakes or a contest on the Netcog Network, we will use the information you provided to contact you in the event you win.


  * Netcog may be required by law enforcement or judicial authorities to provide information on individual users to the appropriate governmental authorities. In matters involving a danger to personal or public safety, Netcog may voluntarily provide information to appropriate governmental authorities.



  User information may be shared internally with other companies within the Netcog group. In addition, the Netcog Network may share user information with third-party companies that are not part of the Netcog group. In order to provide you with content and services that match your interests, the Netcog Network has relationships with many of the best service and content companies. Some of these services require registration before they will function properly. You can recognize most of these sites by looking for the joint branding of Netcog and the third-party company. For example, if you see a logo in the upper-right corner of the page that says 'Brought to you by ______', you are on a co-branded site. Other third-party relationships are "private label" relationships where a service or content company provides Netcog with technology, services and/or content under Netcog Network branding. 

Whenever you provide registration information on co-branded or private label sites, that data may be shared with the third-party company providing the service. You should make every effort to read the individual privacy policies of such third-parties, and make an informed decision on your own whether or not to continue based upon these sites' privacy practices and your own discretion. **You may opt-out of sharing your information with such providers by choosing not to use that service or content.**

The following is a list of third-party companies with whom Netcog has contracted to provide you Products and Services. This list may expand or change from time to time.

__

_Netcog Affiliate Services_.  
Netcog contracts with Be Free, Inc. to provide Traffic Affiliate Program services for the Netcog Network. For more information about Be Free's privacy policy, click [here](http://www.befree.com/docs/includes/privacy.htm).

_Netcog Shop_.  
Please note that, when you purchase goods or services through Netcog Shop, your credit card and identifying information will be provided to third parties in order to verify the credit card data. Furthermore, the data you submit in connection with your use of the Netcog Shop will be provided to individual merchants from whom you order goods or services. Please review carefully the privacy policies of particular merchants that you access through Netcog Shop. Because your privacy and security concerns are important to Netcog, we took action to ensure that the personal data you submit while using the Netcog Shop Shopping Cart (including your credit card number, billing, and shipping information) is passed through "secure servers." Netcog Shop accomplishes this through technology provided by [Verisign](http://www.verisign.com/), which is a member of the [TRUSTe](http://www.truste.com/) program. For the vast majority of purchases made through the Netcog Shopping Cart, your credit card is charged electronically and your actual account number is never presented to the merchant from whom you have purchased.

_User feedback collection_.  
Netcog contracts with partners to collect feedback from randomly-selected users about their satisfaction with the Netcog site. For more information about the their privacy policy, see our partners page.

In addition to finding co-branded and private label sites, you will find direct links on our site to sites offered by third parties. Some of these sites are authorized to use the Netcog Network brands and/or logos. No third-party sites are covered by this Privacy Policy. If you feel that a site using a Netcog Network brand and/or logo does not follow an acceptable privacy policy, please contact the Netcog Privacy Site Coordinator by e-mail at [privacy@netcog.com](mailto:privacy@netcog.com).

  The Netcog Network offers you the ability to opt-out of receiving information on Netcog Network updates and new services, as well as direct mail offers from selected Netcog Network service providers and sponsors. This is done at the point of initial collection of information and during the editing or updating process. The instructions to opt out of most Netcog Network e-mail newsletters and direct mail communications are the same as the instructions for editing user information profiles.

  The Netcog Network has security measures in place to attempt to protect against the loss, misuse and alteration of your user data under our control. Only authorized employees have access to the information you provide us. Netcog has implemented strict rules on employees who have access either to the databases that store user information or to the servers that host our services. While we cannot guarantee that loss, misuse or alteration to data will not occur, we take many precautions to prevent such unfortunate occurrences. Any other particularly sensitive information, such as your credit card number collected for a commerce transaction, is encrypted prior to transmission. 

You are ultimately responsible for the security of your Netcog Network ID and password. Please take care when using and storing them. Netcog recommends that you do not divulge your password to anyone. You should log out of your browser at the end of each computer session to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence, especially if you share a computer with someone else or are using a computer in a public place like a library or Internet cafe.
