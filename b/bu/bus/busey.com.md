Why?                   Financial companies choose how they share your personal information. Federal law gives
                       consumers the right to limit some but not all sharing. Federal law also requires us to tell you how
                       we collect, share, and protect your personal information. Please read this notice carefully to
                       understand what we do.
What?                  The types of personal information we collect and share depend on the product or service you
