# Protecting your privacy is important to First Busey Corporation. The privacy of your information is protected not only by State and Federal Regulations, but also by our commitment to you

Your Right to Financial Privacy   
Protecting your privacy is important to us. The privacy of your information is protected not only by State and Federal Regulations, but also by our commitment to you. We want you to understand what information we collect and how we will use it. You have the right to know the privacy policies and practices of the financial institutions you deal with in respect to information sharing with both affiliates and nonaffiliated third parties. This notice describes our privacy policies and practices and explains what you can do to “opt out” of the information sharing process.

Definitions  
We will use certain terms in this notice that are defined as follows:

  * We, our, and us. This will always mean First Busey Corporation and its affiliates. 
  * You and your. This means our customers with whom we have a continuing relationship through one or more accounts, and also consumers who may use a service we provide (such as an ATM) without any account relationship or who may have applied for a loan but were declined. 
  * Publicly available information. Information that is lawfully available to the general public from official public records (such as real estate records or securities filings), information from widely distributed media (such as telephone books, television, radio, or newspaper) or information that is required to be disclosed to the general public by Federal, State or Local law. 
  * Nonpublic personal information. Personally identifiable financial information that is not available from public sources (as described above). 
  * Affiliate. Any company under common control with another company. 
  * Nonaffiliated third party. Any person(s) or corporate entity that is not an affiliate or is not a joint employee of a financial institution and a third party. 
  * Consumer reporting agency. A person or business which makes a practice of collecting and evaluating consumer credit information for the purpose of furnishing consumer reports to third parties. 



Categories of Information We Collect  
We collect nonpublic personal information about you from the following sources:

  * Information we receive from you on applications and other forms; 
  * Information about your transactions with us, or our affiliates, or others; 
  * Information we receive from third parties, such as a consumer reporting agency. 



Categories of Information We May Disclose About You  
In order to protect customer privacy, we carefully control the way in which information about customers is shared. We do not disclose nonpublic information about our customers or former customers to any third party non-affiliated entity, except as outlined in this policy, or as permitted/required by law.

We choose very carefully the companies that provide support services to us. We may disclose to these companies the information we collect, as described above. These companies are contractually required to adhere to our strict standards of information, security, and confidentiality. They are not allowed to use our customer information for any purpose other than the intended service.

We may disclose nonpublic personal information about you to nonaffiliated third parties or financial institutions that perform marketing services on our behalf. In all cases, a joint marketing agreement must be signed between the Bank and the third party. The agreement shall contain confidentiality and privacy provisions.

As part of an application for insurance, medical information on customers may be obtained, but is shared only with those within the Busey organization in order to process the application.

As part of our effort to provide customers with comprehensive and effective service, we may use customer information to determine whether customers might be interested in specific financial products and services from our affiliates.
