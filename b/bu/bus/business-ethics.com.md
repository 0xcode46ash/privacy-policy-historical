Uses of Subscriber Information

For subscriptions to the printed magazine, we have an opt-out policy, where subscribers can request that we do not share their name and address(es) with anyone. We do rent our print-subscriber mailing list from time to time -- but we do not include any names and addresses for people who have opted out. We NEVER SELL our mailing list for the printed magazine. We also DO NOT RENT or SELL our e-mail newsletter subscriber list or our Web site contact lists. 

We will use a visitor's e-mail address if we have a question about a request made through the site and to send confirmation of receipt of some requests or orders.
