# Business Know-How Privacy Statement

**Our Privacy Policy**

**We respect your privacy!**  
All information collected at this site and at any site run by Attard Communications, Inc. will be kept strictly confidential and will not be sold, reused, rented, loaned, or otherwise used in ways that you have not consented to.

**Personal Information**  
Attard Communications, Inc. does not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease any private personal information collected at our site, including membership forms, surveys or email lists. 

**Browser information collected on the website**  
Attard Communications, Inc. analyzes our website logs to constantly improve the value of the materials available on website. Our website logs are not personally identifiable, and we make no attempt to link them with the individuals that actually browse the site.

**Use of cookies**  
Some of the forms and surveys on this site use cookies. The information stored on the cookies is used only for such processing chores.

**Privacy of our email lists**  
Attard Communications, Inc maintains several email lists to keep our web site and online forum members informed about new features and events. Our list is made up only of those individuals who specifically request their name be added to our mailing list.

We do not sell, rent, loan, trade, or lease the addresses on our list to anyone. From time to time, we do send out special offers on behalf of advertisers to our members. When we do such mailings, the advertisers send us the advertisements, and we send the email. ThusÂ  the advertisers do not have access to your personal contact information unless you respond to their ads and provide them with personal information yourself. 

**Publicly Viewable Business Directory Listings**  
The National Small Business Resource Directory at http://www.businessknowhow.net, functions like a phone directory listing and has been created for the specific purpose of making certain information such as the business name, phone and type of products sold available to the public. When you enter your business listing in the directory, the information you provide will become public information. We have no control over how it will be used.

For further information, please contact Janet Attard, Attard Communications, Inc., 2364 Middle Country Rd., Centereach, NY 11720 (631)-467-6826 email: [attard@businessknowhow.com](mailto:attard@businessknowhow.com)
