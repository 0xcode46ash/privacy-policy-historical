**Cookies**

A cookie is a snippet of text that is sent from a website’s servers and stored on a web browser. Like most websites and search engines, Panacea uses cookies in order to provide a better user experience and to serve relevant ads. Users should be aware that Panacea uses cookies to:

  * identify registered users who return to the Site to a specific log-in session in order that page requests by that visitor are delivered in an effective, secure and consistent manner
  * recognise when a visitor to a Panacea website has visited before; this means we can identify the number of unique visitors we receive to the website and allows us to make sure we have enough capacity for the number of users that we get
  * customise elements of the promotional layout and/or content of the pages of the website



Some company networks block cookies which means that not all Users can enjoy these personalised components of the Site.

Panacea websites also contain some affiliate marketing links, which means we get paid commission on sales of those products or services we mention. Our editorial content is not influenced by advertisers or affiliate partnerships. We use a 3rd Party to enable these affiliate partnerships. You can read their [Privacy Policy](http://skimlinks.com/privacy-policy#users) and find more information on [the cookies they use](http://skimlinks.com/user-cookies).

Panacea uses the DoubleClick cookie within our sites to serve more relevant ads across the web and limit the number of times a given ad is shown to you. When you visit a website, view an ad, or click an ad, this advertising cookie will appear in your browser as coming from the domain “doubleclick.net.”

When the cookie is set on your browser, it allows Panacea to gather information about your browser’s interaction with a given ad. This information gets recorded in a log that looks something like this:

time: 06/Aug/2011 12:01:32  
ad_placement_id: 105  
ad_id: 1003  
userid: 0000000000000001  
client_ip: 178.78.116.122  
referral_url: "<http://businesstraveller/news>"

The “time” field reflects the time the ad was displayed. The “ad placement id” and “ad id” identify the advertising campaign and the specific ad served. The “userid” is the display ad cookie that identifies the browser. The “client IP” reflects the user’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. A “referral URL” indicates the URL of the page where the ad was served. Our logs also record whether a user’s browser clicks or interacts with an ad.

This information helps Panacea deliver ads that are relevant the user’s interests, control the number of times you see a given ad, and measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns.

In addition to cookies, tracking gifs may be set by Panacea or third parties in respect of your use of the Site. Tracking gifs are small image files within the content of our site or the body of our newsletters so we or third parties can understand which parts of the website are visited or whether particular content is of interest. ****
