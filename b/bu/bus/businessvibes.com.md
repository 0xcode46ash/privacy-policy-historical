**Visibility of your Profile to Non-Members of BusinessVibes**  
  
When you register, your default privacy settings aim to promote the spirit of networking. The data contained in your company profile is visible to non-members of BusinessVibes and could be traceable by search engines on the Internet. This, however, does not include personal contact details such as user-specific email addresses or phone numbers. The main contact numbers for your company will be visible, and you may also modify the level of your privacy at any time. This means that you decide whether to increase your level of privacy or opt in favor of more visibility online, enabling more exposure of your profile for potential business partners.

The search functions can also help you to initiate contact with other BusinessVibes Members who offer exactly what you are looking for. Thus, you can find the contacts you need - and systematically expand your personal network
