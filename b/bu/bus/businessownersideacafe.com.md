Privacy Policy for Idea Cafe: The Small Business Channel

Idea Cafe Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our respect for user privacy. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices. 

**Use of Technical Contact Data**

Idea Cafe may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our Web site. 

**Links To Other Sites**

Idea Cafe contains links to other sites. Idea Cafe is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites. 

**Voluntary Opt-in Registration**

Idea Cafe's voluntary registration form requires users to give certain information in order to become a registered "Regular" member. Regulars (members) receive certain privileges, such as access into restricted site areas, contest eligibility and profile submissions; membership privileges may change from time to time. The registration form also gives users the opportunity to provide additional information voluntarily. Idea Cafe totals the data provided by all users to create our site user demographic reports: we share these demographic totals with interested parties. Idea Cafe uses contact information from the registration form to enable our users to receive information we believe helpful via email, mail or other methods. The user's contact information may also be used to contact the user when we believe necessary. If a user checks that he or she wants to receive more information or special offers on a specific topic, although Idea Cafe is not obligated to fulfill their request, Idea Cafe may try to locate a qualified source to provide the user the requested info or offers. For such third-party offers, the user may contact the source to opt-out or update contact data. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from Idea Cafe; see the choice/opt-out section below. 

**Other Opt-in Areas**

Onsite, Idea Cafe has optional areas (such as contests, public forums, profiles, awards/greetings, newsletter/information requests and similar) in which we ask visitors for contact information. We use the contact data submitted to send users various notifications, including but not limited to that their awards/greeting were received, their forum message(s) responded to, and to send information from Idea Cafe and other legitimate resources. In some areas, by posting or submitting, the user agrees to convey certain publication rights; where this is the case, what the user is agreeing to will be clearly marked near the input area, so the user can determine what he or she wants to do. 

**Public Forums**

Idea Cafe makes public forums (including but not limited to CyberSchmooz, profiles, etc.) available for our users' participation. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and each user should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

**Security**

Idea Cafe has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All information is stored on a secure server and password protected.
