The BLN Privacy Policy is published by The BLN (henceforth ‘The BLN’). This Privacy Policy outlines our practices regarding collection and use of information relating to your use of the The BLN Web site (collectively, including all content available through the www.TheBLN.com domain and sub-domains, “the Site”)

The BLN is registered with the UK’s Information Commission as a Data Controller (registration no. Z1667728) in accordance with the Data Protection Act of 1998.

We take the privacy of Users of the Site seriously and we are committed to safeguarding the privacy of these Users while providing a personalised and valuable service. This privacy policy sets out our information-gathering and dissemination practices for the Site. If you have any requests concerning your personal information or any queries with regard to these practices please contact us by e-mail at [privacy@thebln.com](mailto:privacy@thebln.com)

The Site collects information from Users during the registration process and, occasionally, at other times. We try and make the process as rapid and straightforward as possible and we are grateful for the information our Users provide. The more accurate the information we receive from each User, the more specific we can be in our ongoing contact with them.

**Data protection**

The Site will comply with the relevant UK Data Protection laws, so normally any personal details to be provided to us will not be disclosed to third parties outside The BLN’s Customers without the User’s consent (please see also the Site’s Terms and Conditions regarding Data Protection).

Users must be aware and accept that, if we are requested by authorised third parties or regulatory or governmental agencies investigating illegal activities to provide information concerning Users’ activities whilst using the Site, we shall do so.

Similarly, we will disclose Users’ personal data if we are compelled to do so by law. We reserve the right to notify or provide such information to the relevant authority if, in our opinion, we believe an emergency, illegal activity or some other reasonable basis exists for us doing so.

We reserve the right to store and use Users’ personal data solely for our own internal purposes and we further reserve the right to access, monitor and retrieve password-protected information in order to fulfil our obligations in these terms and conditions.

**Uses of registration information**

Registration information we receive from Users is used by us as follows:

  * to allow us to ensure your continued access to the Site;
  * to allow us to develop the Site in ways that you will find relevant and interesting;
  * to let us tell you about new material we have produced that in our reasonable opinion is going to be of relevance and interest to you; and
  * to provide sponsors and advertisers on the Site with aggregate information about our User base and usage patterns
  * to make selected introductions between subscribers with a view to enabling their business activities



When you register, you can choose not to be contacted by us. Any of our Users can also contact us at any time to ask to be removed from our Subscriber list. If you wish to remove your details, you should contact us by email: [privacy@thebln.com](mailto:privacy@thebln.com)

On registration, you will be provided with an opportunity to opt out of being automatically registered for other The BLN services, or from receiving information from The BLN or any advertiser or sponsor of the Site.

**Security**

We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard security systems.

**Transfer of data**

The Internet is a global environment. Using the Internet to collect and process personal data necessarily involves the transmission of data on an international basis. Therefore, by browsing the Site and communicating electronically with us you acknowledge and agree to our processing of personal data in this way. By agreeing to our transfer of your data to third party organisations for them to send you details of products and services offered (as referenced above) you are deemed to provide your consent to any transfer of your data to organisations based either inside or outside the European Economic Area.
