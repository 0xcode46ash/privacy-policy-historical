BusinessOL.com, Inc. uses a password protection scheme to secure any names and addresses provided by visitors who choose to register on this site. 

Visitors to this site are allowed to provide BusinessOL.com, Inc. with their name, address and comments. Providing this information is strictly optional. Visitors are in no way obligated to do so. If the name and address is provided then the person providing this information must also provide a secret password. Only the person knowing this confidential password may ever view or change this information during the site visit or any future visit to this site. 

Names and addresses that are provided by visitors are stored in a database. This database is not at the same location on the server as this web site. Furthermore, security on the database is set so that only the Internet servers (serving web pages) and technical personell who are given systems administrator capabilities can ever view or access the database. Finally, the security on this database is set so that no Internet visitors may access it. 

If the visitor providing the information also provides an email address then an email is sent thanking the visitor. An email will also sent to BusinessOL.com, Inc. with the registration information. 

Transmission of both emails is not secure. 

**Credit Card and Order Information Security**

This site allows visitors to pay for items ordered using a credit card. BusinessOL.com, Inc. processes all credit card transactions using [Authorize.net](http://www.authorize.net/)'s secure [Automated Direct Connect (ADC) Relay Response](http://www.authorizenet.com/support/docs/) methods. A visitor’s card number, name, and expiration date, are transferred via a secure connection directly with Athorize.Net's gateway server. 

When a visitor submits an order containing credit card information, a secure connection is made with Authorize.Net using SSL for bank approval. Authorize.Net processes the entire transaction through the banking system. The credit card number, name, and expiration date are NEVER transmitted to BusinessOL.com, Inc. and can never be stored in any fashion or viewed by BusinessOL.com, Inc.. The entire transaction is between Authorize.net and the buyer. BusinessOL.com, Inc. is not involved in the transaction. 

Authorize.net only transmits to BusinessOL.com, Inc. whether the transaction was accepted or rejected; and if the information was rejected what the rejection reason was. This acceptance or rejection is then communicated by BusinessOL.com, Inc. to the visitor.
