# Privacy Policy | BusinessOnLine

BusinessOnLine respects and protects the privacy of its customers.  Therefore, we would like to share with you the following practices that govern how we protect the privacy of information provided by you to us through our Website.    

## Personal Information

BusinessOnLine collects personal information (e.g., names, addresses, telephone numbers and email) only from visitors to our Website that fill out the BusinessOnLine “Get a Quote” Registration form.  If you fill out the Registration form, the personal information provided by you to BusinessOnLine could be used by us to process your order, to initiate contact with you regarding your request for a quote, to deliver services, process payments, update our records, and communicate with you about our services and to generally maintain your accounts with us.  We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties.   

## Security Measures

BusinessOnLine uses Secured Socket Layer (SSL) or other comparable technology to encrypt any sensitive information that you provide to us (such as credit card information).  In addition, all Registration information provided by you is stored by BusinessOnLine in a password protected database on a secure server.

## Opt Out

In addition to responding to your Order request, BusinessOnLine may use your contact information to tell you about products or services that we think might interest you or invite you to participate in a product or service-related survey.  In all instances, you will have the option of opting out and/or unsubscribing from BusinessOnLine’s e-mail and postal mailing lists. Because the nature of our business does not appeal to children under the age of 13, we do not knowingly acquire or receive any information from children.

## Sharing of Information

In the process of fulfilling your Order, BusinessOnLine may by necessity provide some of your information to third parties.  We may occasionally employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf for business purposes.  Examples could include, without limitation, processing credit card payments, sending postal mail and email, providing services, gathering or analyzing data and providing marketing assistance.  These companies will have access to your personal information only to perform their functions and may not use it for any other purpose.  Further, in the event that BusinessOnLine or substantially all of its assets were acquired, personal information could be one of the transferred assets.  Any use of personal information by such third party transferee would then be in accordance with the terms of this privacy policy or the transferee’s privacy party.  BusinessOnLine may disclose your personal information if we believe we are required to do so by law, court order, subpoena from a court with proper jurisdiction, regulation or other government authority or otherwise in cooperation with an ongoing investigation by a governmental authority or agency. Except in accordance with the business purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy, BusinessOnLine will not sell or provide your personal information to anyone without your permission.

## Use of Technology Cookies

BusinessOnLine may track visitor activity to our site using IP addresses and set temporary cookies to track user sessions.  Cookies are small data files that write to your hard drive when you visit the site.  We use cookies to track user traffic patterns and hold certain registration information.  This data helps us keep track of the number of visitors to our Website and help facilitate the dynamic nature of our site. We may link information we store in cookies to personal information you submit while on our site. Cookies also allow us to make your visit to our site easier by recognizing you when you return and help to provide you with a more customized experience.   

## Web Beacons

BusinessOnLine also uses a “Web beacon” technology, which generates an anonymous notice when a visitor accesses a web page on our Site. Web beacons work in conjunction with cookies to let us know what portions of our Site are of interest to our visitors and to help us provide you with tailored information from our website.   

## Third-Party Privacy Policies

Please be aware that other websites that may be accessed through our Website, may collect personally identifiable information about you. The information practices of those third-party websites linked to the BusinessOnLine Website are not covered by this privacy statement.
