# Privacy policy | Business Link

We are committed to protecting the privacy of all personal information obtained from you during your visits to this website. This privacy policy explains what personal information we may collect from you and the purposes for which it will be used. By using this website you give your agreement to the data practices described in this policy.

### Who is the data controller for this website?

The data controller for this website is the HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC). (The Commissioners for Revenue & Customs, 100 Parliament Street, London SW1A 2BQ). 

### What information do we collect and how do we use it?

Depending on which website facilities you use, we collect five different types of information. The types of information and uses are explained below.

When you register with our site, we may contact you to ask whether you would like to be added to our mailing list, so that we can tell you about our services.

If you are a registered user, we may use information from the five types to offer personalised information when you use the website, notify you of changes to our service, ask your opinions and to help us improve our service to you.

### 1\. Information that you provide to us

We collect and process information that you provide for specific purposes. This may include demographic information such as your name, email addresses, mailing address and telephone number. We use the information to provide you with the specific information, product or services that you request from us and to communicate with you. If you contact us we may keep a record of that correspondence.

You will be asked to provide information about yourself when you use certain site facilities, including the following:

  * 'Email this page' - the email address you type is not retained by us.

  * 'Feedback' - your email address is forwarded to the relevant contact along with your feedback and is not retained on the website.

  * 'Order a publication' - this address is passed to the organisation which manages our publications distribution and is used by us to ensure that you receive publications you have ordered. When you order certain publications you may be given the option of asking your local business support organisation to contact you. In this case your address details are also forwarded to your local business support organisation.

  * 'Contact us' - you will be asked for contact information if you request a call from a local business support organisation. This information is passed to the chosen organisation.

  * 'Registration/My Business' - when you register, we will create a User ID and password with Government Gateway, which is run by the Cabinet Office. Your name, User ID, password and email address will be stored on the Government Gateway servers run by Cabinet Office. Your personal storage area is called 'My Business'. You can change your stored information at any time by logging in. If you are registered with more than one site, the information in My Business will be shared with the other sites you have chosen to register with.

  * 'Sign-up Manager' - you will be asked to enter your contact details together with information that is known to both yourself and the specific department in whose service you are enrolling. This information is passed on to that department and the Cabinet Office, which runs Government Gateway. Your email address will be used to advise you of a successful enrolment.

  * 'Find Contacts' - you will be asked to type your postcode into the search box for the purposes of the search.

  * 'Event Bookings' - we will record the details of your transaction to ensure the fulfilment of your order.

  * Transactional services - when you perform an online transaction through this site, we will, with your permission, send the data you enter within the transaction to the government department or agency concerned. To give a legally correct audit trail, we will store the data for seven years. When you perform an online transaction, we also give you an opportunity to store information in 'My Business'. 'My Business' will give you a record of which departments have been sent your data.

You can decide if you want to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser to either accept all cookies, reject all cookies, or notify you when a cookie is set. Switching off cookies will still allow you to view the majority of content on our site, although it may restrict your use of our interactive tools.

When this privacy policy changes, we will place an updated version on this page and where appropriate we will give you the opportunity to review the revised privacy policy and ask you to agree to it. Regularly reviewing this page ensures that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances, if any, we will share it with other parties. You should continue to check the privacy policy before using this site, even if you have visited it in the past. This ensures that you will be aware of any changes.
