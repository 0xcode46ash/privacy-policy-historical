This Digital Privacy Statement explains information gathering and use practices for websites on the domain, [www.bu.edu](http://www.bu.edu/)[,](http://www.bu.edu%2C/) and Boston University’s other digital properties, such as BU mobile applications (each a “Site” and, collectively, the “Sites”).  The Sites are controlled by Trustees of Boston University (the “University”).  The University is committed to the online privacy of its visitors to and users of the Sites.
