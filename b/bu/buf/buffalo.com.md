Buffalo.com Privacy Policy

Your privacy is very important to us. To make use of certain features of our website, visitors need to register and provide certain information as part of the registration process. 

Registration at Buffalo.com is voluntary, but certain information is required to complete the registration process. By providing required registration information, you agree to receive periodic email notifications of new features, products, offers, or newsworthy items that may interest you. You will have the ability to opt out of these email messages or to discontinue the use of your registered account at any time.

Registration for Buffalo.com is facilitated through Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Open ID and/or Blogger.  These services provide us only with the information Buffalo.com requires for registration, including the registrant’s name, location and date of birth.  This information is private and for the use of Buffalo.com only.  Neither Buffalo.com nor Buffalo.com users will have any access to the account with which you registered than you would otherwise allow. 

We utilize a standard feature of browser software called a “cookie” to assign each visitor a unique number that resides on your browser. We use this as a form of identification. A cookie can’t identify a visitor individually.  The cookie identifies the computer that a visitor uses to access our site. Unless you voluntarily provide personal information through registration for one of our services, we don’t know who you are, even if we assign a cookie to your browser. Our cookie cannot read data off of your hard drive. Our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers may assign their own cookies to your browser when you access their sites, a process we do not monitor or control.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies but, if you do, it is possible that some features of Buffalo.com may not function properly or you may not be able to utilize the personalized services enjoyed by other visitors to our site. For further information on setting your browser’s cookies, please refer to the Help instructions furnished with your browser or contact the browser’s manufacturer. Buffalo.com cannot provide assistance with your cookie settings.

Our web servers automatically collect certain information about your computer’s connection to the Internet when you visit our site, including your IP address, the number that tells computers attached to the Internet where to send you the web pages you want to view. We use your IP address to deliver our web pages to you and to measure our site’s traffic.

To make our site more valuable to our visitors and to provide the content that they seek, we offer some features in conjunction with other providers that specialize in offering such services. Also, our site contains links to many other websites whose privacy policies we do not control. When you click on one of these links and leave our servers (check the URL in your browser’s location bar to see where you are), that site’s privacy policy governs any personal information you provide to that site. We recommend you familiarize yourself with that site’s policy, as it may differ from Buffalo.com’s.

Buffalo.com does not sell, trade or rent any personal information about its users. However, Buffalo.com does share information with our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers to assist them in market research and to confirm the value of advertising on Buffalo.com, and this information is in the form of aggregate statistics on traffic to pages of our site. These statistics include no personally identifying information other than gender and ZIP code.

If you have consented as part of the registration process for Buffalo.com, we also share information on our visitors with our partners, affiliates, sponsors and advertisers that may be marketing products and services of interest to you.

You are given the ability to opt out of these types of messages.
