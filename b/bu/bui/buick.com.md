# GM - Privacy Statement

**I. _About Privacy (effective January 1, 2006)_**

Your privacy is important to General Motors Corporation (GM), as is your trust in GM products and services. We want you to know that the information you share with us will be treated with care.

GM's Privacy Statement for U.S. Consumers lets you know how we handle personally identifiable information you share with GM through gm.com and certain other GM web sites (e.g., GMGoodwrench.com or Chevrolet.com); at events; on Business Reply Cards (BRCs) and sweepstakes entries; and through our customer call centers. It also applies to information about you and your vehicle we obtain from GM affiliates, GM dealers, GM licensees for consumer merchandise, GM credit card bank partners, and other sources such as those that provide lists of potential vehicle purchasers, current owners or potential cardholders. We have also included answers to frequently asked questions about features of GM vehicles that record and transmit data regarding vehicle functions. Some GM web sites have supplemental information on privacy, and others have their own privacy statements, which may be accessed at those web sites. (Click for details on the Scope of the Statement).

The information you share with us may be used by GM, our affiliates, our licensees, and dealers. It may be used by our suppliers exclusively to provide services for GM, and by our business partners to conduct joint marketing programs with GM. **We will not share your personal information with third parties other than these, or with any third party for their independent use without your permission.**

While you may use GM's web sites to learn about our products and services without disclosing any information about you or your vehicle, we may ask you to provide us with personal information including:  
---  
  |   -   | contact information (name, address, city, state and zip code, email address, and telephone number)  
  |   -   | vehicle information (vehicle identification number (VIN), make, model, model year, selling dealer, date of purchase or lease, etc.)

Business Reply Cards and sweepstakes entries you complete at an event or in response to a marketing mailing we send may also ask you to answer some of these same questions so we can tailor what we send to you to your specific interests.

In addition, our GM affiliates, GM dealers, GM merchandise licensees, and other sources such as those that provide lists of potential vehicle purchasers or current owners may give the information they have regarding you or your vehicle to us so that we may serve your needs better.

**Uses**  
Information about you or your vehicle may be used to respond to your requests for product brochures, to customize and improve communication content, or for marketing or product research. It may also be used to provide you with helpful offers and information on GM products and services.

We may share information about you and your vehicle within GM, with our affiliates, and with our dealers. GM may also share personal information collected (such as name, mailing address and email address) with our suppliers for the exclusive purpose of providing services for us (for example, mailing information in response to your request for a vehicle brochure) and with our business partners to conduct joint marketing programs with GM. Information regarding your GM Card will not be shared with GM dealers. 

**GM will not share information about you or your vehicle with any third party for their independent use without your permission. We will not sell your information to any company.**

You may choose to forward information from one of our web sites or emails to another person. Email addresses submitted to our E-card or other Forward to a Friend program, will not be captured for later use in marketing unless that person consents.

We may disclose information about you or your vehicle as required by law, in conjunction with a government inquiry, or in litigation or dispute resolution.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Devices**  
We may use cookies and other tracking devices on our web sites. Using cookies on our sites provides benefits to you, such as allowing you to maintain your account login information between visits, or locating a nearby dealer. The use of cookies also allows us to measure site activity to provide a better user experience. Cookies and other tracking devices may be used to tell us the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our site, the site you visited just before coming to ours, and the name of your Internet service provider.

We may use third parties to serve GM advertisements on other web sites. In serving GM advertisements, these companies may use cookies and other tracking devices to collect certain information about your visits to other web sites (such as browser type, IP address, which page was visited, and time of day). This information may be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you.

You may elect to refuse cookies. Please refer to your browser Help instructions to learn more about cookies and how to manage their use.

**Outside Links**  
This site may contain links to third party sites not controlled by GM or covered by this privacy statement, such as those belonging to GM dealers, GM licensees, or independent product review sites. We recommend that you check the privacy statement of other sites you visit before providing any personal information. Generally we will tell you as you leave our site that another site's privacy statement applies to any data you share on that site.

**Information Security**  
GM recognizes the importance of safeguarding consumer personal information in GM's possession from theft, inappropriate use, or improper distribution. GM has security policies and procedures appropriate to the level of confidentiality of that data. Our suppliers have signed agreements to protect and use your data according to our requirements.

**IV. _Frequently Asked Questions_**

**Q1:**    | What are "GM affiliates"?  
---|---  
**A:**   | As used in this privacy statement, GM affiliates are companies that are owned or controlled by GM. Some examples include Saturn, Saab, GMAC, and OnStar.  
   
**Q2:**   | What is an example of a supplier that provides services to GM?  
**A:**   | Suppliers are companies that provide services on GM's behalf, such as mailing you a brochure you request.  
   
**Q3:**   | What is an example of a GM business partner?  
**A:**   | By business partners, we mean independent companies that conduct joint marketing programs with GM. An example is HSBC USA, which administers the GM Card and GM Extended Family Card. Another example is XM Radio.  
   
**Q4:**   | What do you mean when you say "independent use" or that you will ask for my permission before sharing my information?  
**A:**   | By independent use, we mean for purposes unrelated to GM's and GM affiliates' products and services. For example, if you attend a Buick golf event and the co-sponsor of that event would like to receive the information from the registration form you filled out, you will be asked for your permission on the registration form.  
   
**Q5:**   | What do dealers do with my personal information?  
**A:**   | GM dealers may use your personal information to contact you about your interest in GM products and services and to provide you with information about upcoming events and vehicle incentives. For questions about your dealer's specific privacy practices, please contact your dealer directly.  
   
**Q6:**   | If I opt out of receiving communications from my dealer, will I still receive communications from GM?  
**A:**   | Yes, you may continue to receive communications from us. GM and GM dealers are separate legal entities with their own privacy practices. If you don't want to receive marketing messages from GM regarding our vehicles, you should call 1-866-myprivacy (1-866-697-7482).  
   
**Q7:**   | Will you use my personal information to send me emails?  
**A:**   | Yes, we may. You can access our privacy statement from the gm.com web site and opt-out of unsolicited marketing emails. If you have subscribed to a particular email newsletter or other communication (e.g., My GMLINK Service Reminders, etc.), you should follow the instructions in the email or on their web site to unsubscribe. You must contact your dealer separately.  
   
**Q8:**   | How will you obtain my permission to disclose information about me to a third party?  
**A:**   | An example is information you provide in a BRC (Business Reply Card). We identify the third party on the card and ask for your permission to share that data with them.  
   
**Q9:**   | Does my vehicle have a black box to record data?  
**A:**   | GM vehicles, like other modern motor vehicles, have a number of sophisticated computer systems that monitor and control several aspects of the vehicle's performance. GM vehicles use on-board vehicle computers to monitor emission control components to optimize fuel economy, to monitor conditions for air bag deployment and, if so equipped, to provide anti-lock braking and to help the driver control the vehicle in difficult driving situations. Some information may be stored during regular operations to facilitate repair of detected malfunctions; other information is stored only in a crash event by computer systems, such as those commonly called event data recorders (EDR).  
   
**Q10:**   | Does my vehicle have an RFID feature that transmits my personal data?  
**A:**   | No, many GM vehicles contain sensing and transmitting devices using the same type of radio frequency transmission technology used in RFIDs that can contain personal information. These devices are used to perform functions such as checking tire pressure. The devices do not store or transmit personal data.
