# GM - Privacy Policy

You don't want your personal information to fall into the wrong hands. Neither does General Motors.

When you visit one of the General Motors web sites, we may collect and store information about your visit on an anonymous, aggregate basis using "cookie" technology. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your hard drive. Cookies may tell us the time and length of your visit, the pages you look at on our sites, and the site you visited just before coming to ours. We may also record the name of your Internet service provider. This information allows us to measure site activity to tailor information to suit your individual preferences. The goal is to save you time and provide you with a more meaningful visit.

We may also use third parties to serve GM advertisements on other web sites. In serving GM advertisements, these third parties may place cookies on your browser computer and may collect certain anonymous information about your visits to other web sites. This information includes browser type, IP address, Web activity, and time of day. This information is not personally identifiable and is used to better understand and optimize GM's online advertising campaigns. If you are concerned about cookies, you may modify your browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie. If you do not know how to modify your browser settings please consult your browser documentation or the supplier web site.

There are also several opportunities on our web sites for you to provide us with information about you and your interests, such as your name, mailing address and e-mail address. If you choose to share any personal information with us, we may store it and use it for marketing research and other marketing purposes, which may include sharing it with other companies in the General Motors family and our business partners.

You should be aware that when you voluntarily disclose personal information in public areas of our web sites, such as chat rooms or bulletin boards, this information may be seen and used by others. We urge you to exercise good judgement when sharing personal information in these forums.

You take online privacy seriously, and so does General Motors. It's our way of sustaining your trust in General Motors and our products and services.

General Motors reserves the right to alter our privacy principles as business needs require. Any alterations to these principles will be posted on our web sites in a timely manner. Applicable to U.S.-based divisions.
