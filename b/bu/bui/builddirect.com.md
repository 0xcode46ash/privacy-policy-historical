_**3\. What Personal Information of yours may be collected via the Site?**_

If you register as a member under the Membership section of the Site, BuildDirect.com collects certain information from you and/or your company, in order to provide our services to you via the Site. Such information may include a member's name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, billing address information as well as information about any other users that have been authorized by the member to use the Site on the member's behalf. At this time, BuildDirect.com also asks if you would like to receive offers, updates, newsletters or information from Build-Direct.com regarding our products and services (the "Materials"). If you answered "yes", we may occasionally send you Materials, that we believe may be of interest to you, via e-mail or fax.

If a member then uses our services via the Site, information about their online or business activities that can be directly linked to them will also be collected by BuildDirect.com. Although currently not a practice of BuildDirect.com, we may, in the future, occasionally call upon our members via email to provide input or respond to surveys related to our services. We will do so only in a manner which is sensitive to and respectful of our members' privacy. Any member may specifically request that no such contact be made by forwarding their email addresses to: ¨. As noted - this is currently not done, therefore the functionality to 'opt out' does not exist.

"Personal Information" includes any of these types of information that can be associated with a specific individual or entity. Please remember that you control what Personal Information you provide to BuildDirect.com while visiting the Site. You can visit the Site without registering as a member or providing any Personal Information at all.

BuildDirect.com may provide aggregate statistics about our members, sales, traffic patterns, and related Site information to reputable third-party advertisers for marketing purposes, but these statistics will include no personally identifying information.

 _ **6\. What are cookies and how are they used?**_

A "cookie" is a small piece of information sent by a web server to store on a web browser so it can later be read back from that browser. This is useful for having the browser remember some specific information.   
BuildDirect.com uses cookies within our WebStore to maintain a verifiable connection between a user’s browser and our Web Server. These cookies contain no personal or account information and are deleted from the browser when the Server connection is lost, or the user logs out of the system. 

_**7\. Website Administration**_

When you visit the Site, some information may be collected automatically by the software that operates our Site (e.g. the site from which you linked, your Internet Service Provider, the time and date of your visit). Our servers do not track, collect, or distribute personal information about visitors to our Site. This information is used by our technical engineers to compile aggregate statistics about the total number of daily visitors to our Site, the pages most frequently visited, and how long people stay at each page. None of the information that we report allows for the personal identification of individuals.

 _ **8\. What are the choices available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of your Personal Information?**_

If a member indicates upon registration or later that the member is interested in receiving Materials from BuildDirect.com whether by way of e-mail, fax, direct mail, or all three, BuildDirect.com may, from time to time, send you email, faxes or direct mail containing Materials that we believe may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive these, simply tell us when you give us your membership information or edit your membership information to indicate that you no longer wish to receive all, or certain Materials.

As indicated earlier, BuildDirect.com does not sell, trade, or rent your Personal Information to others. We will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.

 _ **9\. How can you access, update or delete your information?**_

**Administrator**   
Each member company must establish an Administrator for the BuildDirect.com WebStore. The Administrator is responsible for his or her company's overall use of the WebStore, and specifically the following duties:   
· Designating other Authorized Users.   
· Maintaining Membership Account Information.   
· Assigning passwords.   
· Maintaining confidentiality of account information. 

**Authorized Users**   
Authorized Users must be designated by the member company's Administrator.   
An Administrator is responsible for managing your company's membership account, including designating other Authorized Users and maintaining the confidentiality of passwords and all membership information. Authorized Users may purchase or view products, at the discretion of the Administrator, and may change their own passwords and personal information. If an Authorized User forgets his or her password, that Authorized User must request the Administrator to reset a new password. The Administrator may change any or all of the account information for any Authorized User. 

For all other problems signing in, please see the How To section of our Site. At any time, an Administrator can choose to have its membership account(s) and associated email addresses eliminated from our databases entirely by contacting [customerservice@builddirect.com](mailto:customerservice@builddirect.com). 

_**10\. What security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of the information?**_

Your membership account information is password protected so that only the Administrator has access to this personal information. We recommend that you do not divulge your password to anyone. Remember to log off your computer or close your browser window when you have finished to ensure that others cannot access your personal information and correspondence.

Authorized Users can access the Site using their own personal passwords, but are only given selective authority to perform certain functions on your behalf by their Administrator. At any time, an Administrator may change an Authorized User's personal password to prevent his or her access to the Site, limit the Authorized User's authority to perform certain functions on behalf of the member, or otherwise change, add or delete Authorized Users.

If an Authorized User is no longer authorized to act on your behalf, their Administrator is responsible for using these security procedures that we have made available to you to terminate or limit the Authorized User's access to the Site. Generally, it is the Administrator's responsibility to use the Site properly and manage the Membership Account, including establishing appropriate policies, securely managing password and other access capabilities. 

All login, membership and order information is sent from the User's browser to BuildDirect.com via an encrypted data connection. 

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, BuildDirect.com does not represent or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or from our online products or services, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on our systems.

To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are accessed via our Site or other sites through the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they adhere to their own privacy customs and policies. Since BuildDirect does not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the privacy customs and policies of that third party. We encourage you to ask questions before you disclose your personal information to others, and you are advised to undertake your own due diligence of such websites.
