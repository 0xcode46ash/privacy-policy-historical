This policy also covers our treatment of any information shared with us by third parties. Sometimes we may collect Personal Information about you from other sources, provided that such sources confirm to us that they are permitted to share such information, such information is publicly available or the collection is required or authorized by law. Examples of collection from other sources include collections from: 

  * a government agency or registry; 
  * a business, trade, or professional organization; 
  * your accountant; 
  * an employment agency or your current or previous employer.

  * to help us make credit decisions about clients, prevent fraud, check the identity of new clients and prevent money laundering; 
  * to help us make a decision with respect to employment or an appointment with BuildDirect; and 
  * as required or authorized by law.



BuildDirect does not and will not sell, rent, share or disclose your Personal Information without first receiving your permission or as disclosed in this policy. Under certain circumstances, BuildDirect will disclose your Personal Information: 

  * when you have consented to the disclosure; 
  * to fulfill the purpose for which the Personal Information was collected; 
  * when the services we are providing to you require us to give information to third parties, for example: providing government-assigned identification numbers to customs brokers or other third parties responsible for processing customs clearance for shipments; 
  * if we engage a third party to provide services to us (like computer back-up services, archival file storage, or payroll processing, and the third party is bound by confidentiality obligations; 
  * where it is necessary to collect a debt owed to BuildDirect or its agents, or to pay a debt owed by BuildDirect; 
  * to respond to an emergency where the health or safety of any individual is reasonably believed to be threatened; 
  * if the information is already publicly known; and 
  * when we are required or authorized by law to do so. 



Except when we are required by law to disclose Personal Information, where commercially practicable we will use contractual or other means to protect Personal Information disclosed to third parties. 

We may also use your Personal Information to generate Summarized Data for internal use and for sharing with affiliates, subsidiaries, advertisers and business partners. Your identity and Personal Information will be kept anonymous in Summarized Data. Summarized Data will be used for marketing and planning purposes. 

By providing Personal Information to us, you voluntarily consent to the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information as specified in this policy. Without limiting the foregoing, we may on occasion ask you to consent when we collect, use, or disclose your Personal Information in specific circumstances, in which case we may ask for your consent in writing although in some circumstances we may accept your oral consent. Sometimes your consent will be implied through your conduct with us if the purpose of the collection, use or disclosure is obvious and you voluntarily provide the information. In addition, we may collect, use and disclose Personal Information without your consent when we are required or authorized by law to do so. 

Individuals have the right to withdraw their consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of Personal Information at any time, except where that withdrawal would frustrate the performance of a legal obligation by BuildDirect. Upon reasonable written notice given to BuildDirect, all Personal Information held by BuildDirect that is identifiable to that individual will be removed from our records and a notice of the impact of that removal will be provided to the individual. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you withdraw consent, BuildDirect nonetheless reserves the right to retain, collect, use and disclose Personal Information without your consent where we are permitted by law to do so. 

  * You may wish to opt out of receiving certain information and marketing or promotional materials from BuildDirect. You may do so by selecting the opt-out or unsubscribe feature in our Online communications including our online newsletter and product updates, or by writing to us at the address at the end of this policy. 
  * From time to time, BuildDirect may engage an independent marketing agency to distribute advertisements to consumers who have expressed an interest in receiving such material. For this purpose, the marketing agency may use its own distribution list of names and addresses. This contact information is not provided to BuildDirect, nor is this information in the custody or control of BuildDirect. While such lists are composed of names of individuals believed to have voluntarily provided their informed consent for this marketing purpose, it is possible that an individual’s name may be included on the list in error, or that an individual may wish to have his/her name removed from the list. Should an individual contact BuildDirect to request that his/her name be removed from such a list, BuildDirect may relay this request to the marketing agency as a matter of good will toward the requestor. In such a case, however, BuildDirect incurs no responsibility or liability for the actions of the marketing agency. The requestor should also be aware that by having his/her name removed from such a third-party marketing list, he/she may also forego receiving promotional material and any ensuing benefits, financial or in other kind, from other organizations which may contract the services of agencies that use the list. 


  * Individuals have the right to know what Personal Information BuildDirect has collected about them, how that information is being used and to whom it has been disclosed, as well as to verify and amend that information if it is incorrect. Upon receiving, at the address at the end of this policy, a written access request and a handling fee of US$10.00, and where the identity of the requestor can be confirmed, information held by BuildDirect that is identifiable to the requestor, as well as information on all use and disclosures of that information, will normally be released to the requestor within 30 days, except where that release is not required or is prohibited by law. If necessary, BuildDirect will correct the Personal Information if requested to do so. Where an access request requires more extensive treatment, we will advise the requestor of the approximate cost of responding to the request. The requestor should provide enough detail to enable BuildDirect to confirm the identity of the requestor. 



Your rights to access your Personal Information are not absolute. We may deny access: 

  * when denial of access is required or authorized by law; 
  * when granting you access would have an unreasonable impact on other people’s privacy; 
  * to protect our firm’s rights and property; or 
  * where the request is frivolous or vexatious. 



If we deny your request for access to, or refuse a request to correct Personal Information, we will explain why.
