Your privacy is of concern to Hanley-Wood, LLC, and its affiliated Web sites. This statement summarizes our current policy on privacy – specifically, the use of any personally identifiable and demographic information we may gather on visitors to our Web sites.

We track the total number of readers visiting the different sections and features on our Web sites. This information is used collectively to give us a better understanding of our readers’ interests, and to improve the quality of our sites. We share this aggregate information with our advertisers. We do not share any personally identifiable information with our advertisers.

We only collect personally identifiable information when it is knowingly volunteered by readers in exchange for a service or benefit, such as receiving our electronic newsletter, or entering a contest. We currently use that information strictly for internal use. We do not sell or distribute any personally identifiable information outside of the company. We do not collect any information from children 13 or under. 

If, in the future, we decide to share any of your personally identifiable information outside organizations, we will seek your express approval in advance. In addition, site visitors will have the opportunity to "opt out" – i.e., choose to remove their name from our lists simply by clicking on the appropriate option. All registrants will be able to opt in or out at any time if they change their minds at a later date.

We maintain reasonable precautions to keep any personal information secure. However, we are not responsible for any breach of our sites’ security as a result of any unauthorized third part actions. Also, while we provide links to a large number of other Web sites, we are not responsible for the outside sites’ content, actions, privacy policies, or any information they may gather on their visitors. We encourage you to review these sites' privacy policies prior to providing them with any of your personally identifiable information.

We welcome your comments on our privacy policy. Feel free to e-mail New Media Editor John Butterfield at [jbutterf@hanley-wood.com](mailto:jbutterf@hanley-wood.com) or call him at 202-736-3413 if you have any questions or concerns.
