# GolfCourses.com, Golf Courses in your area

**Privacy Statement**

**Updated September 24, 2005**

This statement discloses the privacy practices for all properties under Beach Farm Nine, L.L.C. (BFN) including, but not limited, to GolfCourses.com, GolfLessons.com, GolfResorts.com, GolfTips.com, GolfShirts.com and BudgetGolf.com. 

Beach Farm Nine drafted this policy out of respect to general customer concerns over security, confidentiality and protective care of personal and professional information on the Internet.

**E-mail addresses**

Beach Farm Nine respects each member’s privacy and will not sell, trade or release personal information without the member’s specific approval. This includes name, address, e-mail address, phone number or any other personal information the member has provided to BFN. 

When a member submits an e-mail address, it is used by Beach Farm Nine to provide the information requested - whether it's access to weekly newsletters, BudgetGolf.com coupons in selected areas and/or announcements on other golf specials and announcements which the member has selected to receive. Beach Farm Nine does not engage in the selling of e-mail lists, or its client database. 

**Personal information and membership data**  
Beach Farm Nine treats personal information the same way it treats e-mail addresses - it will not sell, trade or release personal information without the member’s specific approval. Beach Farm Nine’s primary reason for collecting information is to tailor its content and announcements according to each person's locale. 

As BFN allows open comments on some of its properties – including, but not limited to GolfCourses.com and DiscussGolf.com – it is necessary to capture the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of those who comment. This is done to prevent abuse of the forums. (added Sept. 24, 2005) 

As BFN provides discounted green fees through BudgetGolf.com, members – who’ve selected to receive these announcements – will be notified via e-mail of new coupons in their area.  (added Sept. 24, 2005)

Periodically, BFN will send e-mails to members with announcements on information selected approved by the member.  These announcements include golf schools, events, discounts on golf equipment, as well as golf, vacation and spa packages through other BFN properties.

In order to enhance the golf experience – based upon the member’s preferences – BFN also provides special offers, catalogs and product information from its advertisers but only if the member has requested to receive such information. 

**Site visitors and traffic**  
Beach Farm Nine reviews information from its server logs such as search engine and url referrals, IP addresses, page views and other, similar information. Beach Farm Nine uses this information only to view its traffic count, determine error messages and other usability features. 

Beach Farm Nine only collects information it considers necessary to implement benefits to its members.  There may be changes to BFN’s privacy policy from time to time, but it will not impact the original philosophy on privacy.  If BFN does make changes, it will make note of these changes on this privacy page. 

If the member does not wish to receive these e-mails, special offers, catalogs or product information, simply [let BFN know](http://www.golfcourses.com/unsubscribe.cfm) and the member will be removed from the list.
