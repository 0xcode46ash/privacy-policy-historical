**Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy (“Policy”), effective 9/5/2014, tells you about ProperLiving’s privacy practices governing personal information we may collect when you visit our budgetchallenge.com website (including any subdomains), and how we may use and share that information.  Your prior activities on the site may have been governed by an earlier version of this Policy.

From time to time, and only as permitted by law, we may use your information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Policy.  If our information practices do change materially, we will post the changes to our website and revise our Policy accordingly.  In addition, if we have collected personally-identifying information from you, we will notify you via email and secure your consent before using your personal information in new ways.

**Special Note to Teachers, Students and Parents:** Programs, games, contests, and services offered through budgetchallenge.com and any related subdomains are not marketed to children under the age of 13, nor do we knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13.

**_What Information Do We Collect?_**

Personal Information:

We collect personal and contact information you choose to provide to us in connection with your activities on the site.  What we collect depends on whether you are a teacher, student, or parent.

TEACHERS:

To register for Budget Challenge, you will be asked for your first and last name, school name and school address, and email address.  You will also set up a user name and password.  You will also be asked to provide a class team name for identification of the class on publically visible webpages.  You have full discretion on whether to choose a name that may reveal identifiable information (such as school name, city, mascot, state, teacher, etc.) or not. 

STUDENTS:

To register for Budget Challenge, you will be asked for your first and last name and your email address.  We will match that up with your school’s name and address which has already been provided to us when your teacher registered the class.  You will also set up a user name and password.  In addition, if you submit questions to the site during the simulation, we collect any information you provide in asking your question.

PARENTS:

If your student invites you to register to view his or her account, you will be asked for your first and last name and your email address.  You will also set up a user name and password.

Other user information we collect:

In addition, for each visitor to our site, we automatically gather certain other potentially identifying information and store it in log files.  This information includes (as applicable) internet protocol (IP) addresses, geolocation information and last login date and time.  We collect and store this information on an individual basis and in aggregate, or combined, form.  We use proprietary algorithms to calculate behavior, knowledge, and skill statistics using individual simulation activity for each student.  We also collect both user-specific and aggregate information on what pages visitors access or visit.

“Do Not Track” Signals.  We do not currently have the capability to recognize browser “Do Not Track” signals.  We adhere to the standards set forth in this privacy policy.

Cookies – A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes.  If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site will be limited.  We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.  We use session cookies to record session information, such as which web pages a user has visited, and to track user activity on the site.  We also use session cookies to store any passwords used on the site (such as a password associated with a user account), so you don’t have to enter it more than once per session.  Session cookies are set with long expiration times to enhance the usability of our mobile app and simplify the login process of our website.

Analytics – _  _To determine how many users visit our site, how often they visit this site, and to better understand the areas of greatest interest to our visitors, we use tools called “Google Analytics” and “New Relic” to compile this information for us.  As a result of your visit to our site, these companies may collect information such as your domain type, your IP address, your location and clickstream information.  We do not combine the information collected through the use of analytics tools with personally identifiable information.  For more information about the analytics companies’ ability to use and share information about your visits to this site, see [http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/](http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/)

Ad Networks – We do not use ad networks on our site, and we do not host ads for others. 

**_How Do We Use and Share the Information We Collect?_**

We store and process your Personal Information to facilitate your participation in, and/or observation of, the Budget Challenge simulations.

We use information we collect to analyze trends, to administer the site, and to track users’ movements around the site.  We also use this information to improve the simulations and to make our site more useful to visitors.

The following Personal Information you provide to us through the site is displayed to others as follows:

TEACHERS:  Your name, school, school state, and class averages will be added to our list of winning teachers if your class wins a simulation by achieving the highest class average score.  All class team names, class score average, and class engagement average are visible to the public on a leaderboard per simulation. 

STUDENTS:  Your class and your teacher will be able to see your name, ranking, scores, survey points, and account activity.  Your teacher will also be able to see your email address, user name, password, quiz activity, and any questions you submit to us during the simulation, along with our responses.  If you invite your parents to view your account, they will be able to see your name, rank, and quiz activity, but will not see any other students’ names.

            PARENTS:  None of your information is displayed to others on the site.

We do not share Personal Information we collect with any third parties, except as follows:

·         If you are participating through [www.hrblock.budgetchallenge.com](http://www.hrblock.budgetchallenge.com/), we may share with H&R Block information necessary for H&R Block to administer the program, including your name and ranking.  H&R Block does not use this information to market to you.

·         We share information to the extent reasonably necessary to comply with law enforcement requests and judicial proceedings, and to ensure the safety and security of the site.

·         We may engage in research with academic institutions.  However, if we do so, we will use only non-personally-identifiable data sets.

It is possible that, at some time in the future, our company may be sold along with its assets, or may engage in business transactions in which customer information is one of the assets transferred. In such a case, the customer information which we have gathered may be one of the business assets we transfer. 

**_How Long Do We Keep the Information We Collect?_**

We will retain your Personal Information in accordance with our continuing business need to service this relationship and/or to improve the Budget Challenge simulations.

We reserve the right to ask for information verifying your identity prior to updating or correcting any information to you, or deleting your information.  Should we ask for verification, the information you provide to verify your identity will be used only for that purpose, and all copies of this information in our possession will be destroyed when the process is complete. 

**_Security_**

The security of your Personal Information is important to us.  We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, and to guard that information against loss, misuse, or alteration.   

Please note, however, that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure.  Therefore, while we use commercially-reasonable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
