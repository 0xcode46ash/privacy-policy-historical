# Buddy Media Privacy Policy

**Buddy Media, Inc. (“Buddy Media”) has prepared this Privacy Policy to explain our policy regarding Personal data that is collected on or through our website (“Site”). All capitalized terms shall have the meaning defined herein.**

**Personal Data:** We collect personal data from You, the user, when You voluntarily choose to register with Buddy Media. We use the personal data that we collect in order to provide and improve our services, and as otherwise set forth in this Privacy Policy and in any applicable service-specific agreement, such as the Terms and Conditions for Publishers or the Terms and Conditions for Advertisers. Examples of personal data include first name, last name, address, email address, telephone number, birth date, billing and credit card information.

**Use of Personal Data:** Buddy Media uses the personal data You provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy or with any applicable service-specific agreement. If You provide personal data for a certain reason, we may use the personal data in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, we will use the personal data You input during the registration process to administer access to the Site. Buddy Media and its affiliates also use your personal data and other personally non-identifiable information collected through the Site to help us improve the content and functionality of the Site, to better understand the users of our Site, and to improve our services.

**Personally Non-Identifiable Information:** We may collect personally non-identifiable information from You at the time of registration, or when You choose to use certain of our services. This information is not, by itself, sufficient to identify or contact you. Examples include demographic data, age, education level, profession or gender. Buddy Media may store such information, or it may be included in databases owned and maintained by Buddy Media’s affiliates, agents or service providers. This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site and the domain names of our visitors’ Internet service providers. It is important to note that no personal data is available or used in this process.

**Passively Collected Information:** When You interact with us through the Site, we receive and store certain additional personally non-identifiable information. Such information, which is collected passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to specifically identify you. Examples include IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Site and/or our services.

**Aggregated Personal Data:** In an ongoing effort to better understand our users, we might analyze the personal data that is provided to the Site in aggregate form. This aggregate information does not identify You personally. We may share this aggregate data with our affiliates, agents and business partners. We may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

**Cookies:** In operating this Site, we may use a technology called “cookies.” A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your computer when You access a website. Our cookies help provide additional functionality to the Site and help us analyze Site usage more accurately.

**Sharing Information:** Buddy Media may share your personal data with certain third parties without notice to You under certain circumstances, including those set forth below: 

  * Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties: Buddy Media, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.
  * Business Partners: Buddy Media may aggregate your personal data with personal data of other users, and disclose such information in a non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties for marketing and promotional purposes. In these situations, Buddy Media will not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to identify You personally.
  * Legal Requirements: Buddy Media may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation, (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Buddy Media, (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the Site or the public, or (d) protect against legal liability.
  * Business Transfers: As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, personal data may be part of the transferred assets.

However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free. In particular, e-mail sent to or from this Site may not be secure, and You should therefore take special care in deciding what information You send to us via e-mail.
