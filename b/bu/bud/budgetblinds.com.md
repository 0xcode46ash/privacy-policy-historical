This Privacy Policy covers Budget Blinds’ treatment of personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) that Budget Blinds gathers when you are accessing Budget Blinds’ Web site and when you use Budget Blinds’ services. This policy does not apply to the practices of Budget Blinds that Budget Blinds does not own or control, or to individuals that Budget Blinds does not employ or manage. 

**Types of Information Collected**   
The information we gather from visitors to the Budget Blinds Web site enables us to personalize and improve our services. We collect the following types of information from our visitors: 

**Personal Information You Provide to Us**   
We receive and store any information you enter on our Web site or provide to us in any other way. The types of Personal Information collected includes: your name, address, email address, telephone and facsimile number. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some of the services offered through this Web site. The Personal Information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products, services and information, identifying you, and communicating with you about specials and new products and opportunities. 

Personal Information Collected Automatically   
We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with our Web site or services. Budget Blinds automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP address, Budget Blinds cookie information, and the page you requested.   
Generally, our service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and its components. Budget Blinds only uses this data in aggregate form, that is, as a statistical measure, and not in a manner that would identify you personally. This type of aggregate data enables us to figure out how often visitors use parts of the Web site or services so that we can make the Web site appealing to as many visitors as possible, and improve those services. 

**Email Communications**   
We may send email communications to you to inform you about specials, product updates, new products and/or information about the Budget Blinds and Tailored Living franchise opportunity. If you do not want to receive e-mail or other mail from us, you may “opt out” by visiting <http://www.budgetblinds.com/email-newsletter>

**Cookies**   
Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer’s hard drive through your browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people. Budget Blinds cookies do not collect Personal Information, and we do not combine the general information collected through cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you are or what your email address is. 

Most browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your browser software) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of our Web site’s features. 

**Sharing of Personal Information**   
Personal Information about the visitors to our Web site is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We will share your Personal Information only with subsidiaries that are under the direct control of Budget Blinds and as described below. 

If Budget Blinds, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Budget Blinds goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, visitor information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Budget Blinds may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy. 

We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Budget Blinds, our employees, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. 

Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information. 

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**   
Budget Blinds may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used/collected.
