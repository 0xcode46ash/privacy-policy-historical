There are times, however, when we may need information from you, such as you full name, home address, e-mail address and phone number. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personal information from you on the Internet.

If you choose to give us personal information via the Internet that we may need to correspond with you or process an order, it is our intent to let you know how we will use this information.

For example, in the future, we may recommend products or features you may like based on what you have liked in the past. Lastly, we keep track of the domains from which people visit us. We analyze this data for trends and statistics, and then we discard it. We do not sell, rent, loan, or transfer any personal information regarding our customers to any unrelated third parties.
