# Privacy & Security - Burt's Bees

When you provide us with information through Burtsbees.com (the "Site"), we respect your privacy. It is important for you to understand what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.

Please note that this Privacy Policy governs only information provided by the Site. It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference Burt's Bees, e.g., communications from retailers.

This Privacy Policy is designed to tell you about our practices regarding collection, use and disclosure of information that you may provide via this Site. Please be sure to read this entire Privacy Policy before using or submitting information to this Site. 

## What Customer information does burtsbees.com collect?

While maintaining our commitment to your privacy, we do collect personally and non-personally identifiable information about you. A detailed description of the types of information collected is outlined below.

Personally identifiable information includes your name, shipping address, billing address, email address and credit card information. We collect this information during the online checkout and email newsletter registration processes so that we can properly fulfill your orders and requests.

Non-personally identifiable information includes your browser type, domain name, IP address and how you maneuvered through the Site. We collect this information so that we can identify general shopping and navigation patterns so we might better understand how to improve your experience with us.

## Collection of Personally Identifiable Information

We do not collect personally identifiable information about you, except when you provide it to us. For example, if you decide to complete a user registration form or online survey, you may be asked to provide certain information such as your contact information (name, email address, mailing address and telephone number), age group, gender and product concerns and the brands and products you use. If you decide to place an order, we will also need to know your delivery and billing address, credit card number and expiration date. To protect your personal information, users registering at the Site must also enter a user name/email address and password.

If you would prefer that we not collect any personally identifiable information from you, please do not provide us with any such information. You will be informed what information is required and what information is optional.

When you submit your personally identifiable information on the Site, you are giving your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information

As you navigate through this Site, certain anonymous information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without your actively providing the information) using various technologies, such as cookies, Internet tags or web beacons and navigational data collection (log files, server logs, clickstream). Your Internet browser automatically transmits to this Site some of this anonymous information, such as the URL of the website you just came from and the Internet Protocol (IP) address and the browser version your computer is currently using. This Site may also collect anonymous information from your computer through cookies and Internet tags or web beacons. You may set your browser to notify you when a cookie is sent or to refuse cookies altogether, but certain features of this Site might not work without cookies.

This Site may use and combine such passively collected anonymous information to provide better service to Site visitors, customize the Site based on your preferences, compile and analyze statistics and trends and otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Such information is not combined with personally identifiable information collected elsewhere on the Site unless you have consented.

A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your Web browser that helps the Site remember information about you and your preferences.

"Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are used to improve navigation, block visitors from providing information where inappropriate (the Site "remembers" previous entries of age or country of origin that were outside the specified parameters and blocks subsequent changes) and collect aggregate statistical information on the Site. They are erased once you exit your Web browser or otherwise turn off your computer.

"Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (such as passwords), helping to determine what areas of the website visitors find most valuable and customizing the website based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed by this Site on your computer may hold personally identifiable information, but only if you have registered or have otherwise consented to the retention of personally identifiable information you have provided at the Site. Otherwise, our Site's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookie has returned to the Site.

You can set your browser to accept all cookies, to reject all cookies, or to notify you whenever a cookie is offered so that you can decide each time whether to accept it. To learn more about cookies and how to specify your preferences, please search for "cookie" in the "Help" portion of your browser.

A Site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). The IP address can be used to diagnose problems with a server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to a Site and administer and improve the Site.

"Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. Tags may be placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the Site and on different pages of the Site. Such tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted.

"Navigational data" (log files, server logs and clickstream data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the Site, market research purposes and to communicate information to visitors.

## Your Consent

By using this Site, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. Whenever you submit information via this Site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). [Learn more about SSL. >](https://seal.verisign.com/splash?form_file=fdf/splash.fdf&dn=WWW.BURTSBEES.COM&lang=en)

We implement various security measures in accordance with industry standards to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. This Site takes reasonable steps to protect personally identifiable information as you transmit it to our Site and to protect such information from loss, misuse and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. You should always keep in mind that no Internet transmission is ever completely secure or error-free. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

## Children Under 13

We take special steps to safeguard the privacy of children. This Site is not intended for children under the age of 13. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information via this Site from visitors in this age group. We encourage parents to talk to their children about their use of the Internet and the information they disclose to websites.

## Use and Disclosure of Information

Except as otherwise stated, we may use information collected via this Site to improve the content of our Site, to customize the Site to your preferences, to communicate information to you (if you have requested it), for our marketing and research purposes and for any other purpose specified. In addition, we may make full use of all information acquired through this Site that is not in personally identifiable form.

We do not sell, trade, or rent your email or phone number to anyone. We use outside shipping companies to ship orders (FedEx, APX, USPS, or UPS) and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies may receive personally identifiable information to help us process your order. These companies will not retain share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. Your personal data will be stored on file at Burt's Bees headquarters for as long as your account is active. We may disclose personally identifiable information you provide via this Site to third parties that are not associated with Burt's Bees, but only:

  1. to contractors we use to support our business (such as fulfillment services, technical support, delivery services and financial institutions), in which case we will require such third parties to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes;
  2. in connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the business of this Site to which the information relates, in which case we will require any such buyer to agree to treat it in accordance with this Privacy Policy and use it for the same purposes; or
  3. to respond to law enforcement requests or where required by applicable laws, court orders, or government regulations.



The collection, use and disclosure of information contemplated in this Privacy Policy may involve a transfer of the information to jurisdictions located outside your country of residence that may not have equivalent laws and rules regarding personally identifiable information. In these cases, you will be asked to consent to such transfers and disclosures in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
