# Burst Media

Effective date: 12/14/2007

Fundamentally, the privacy of Web users must be protected, and the most effective way to preserve that privacy is to confine that data at the site level. Burst Media as well as Burst AdConductor collects no personally identifiable data, and therefore protects user privacy while eliminating an unnecessary costly feature. Burst’s TRUSTe license verifies this privacy stance. 

### TRUSTe 

#### Burst Network Publishers:

This confirms that Burst Media is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. We also participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. The privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.burstmedia.com and www.burstnet.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Operations at [privacy@burstmedia.com](mailto:privacy@burstmedia.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php> . TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. 

#### AdConductor Publishers: 

Burst Media is a licensee of the TRUSTe Privacy Program. We also participate in the EU Safe Harbor Privacy Framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce. The privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for www.AdConductor.com and ads.AdConductor.com. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, you should first contact Operations at [privacy@AdConductor.com](mailto:privacy@AdConductor.com). If you do not receive acknowledgment of your inquiry or your inquiry has not been satisfactorily addressed, you should then contact TRUSTe <http://www.truste.org/consumers/watchdog_complaint.php> . TRUSTe will then serve as a liaison with the Web site to resolve your concerns. 

Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to Burst, our Web publisher members, and our advertiser clients. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find below a description of how Burst strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium. 

### User Information 

All users who receive an ad served by Burst retain complete anonymity where Burst is concerned. As ads are delivered, Burst does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private property. Burst does, however, collect information that is specific to how you use the Internet. Burst servers note non-personally identifying details such as, but not limited to, the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ad's effectiveness on behalf of Burst clients and customers.

There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, Burst (or a third party working in conjunction with burst and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the advertiser client. The client uses this information to deliver the goods or services requested by the user. When requested, Burst may employ this information in a compiled format without identifying users specifically to provide to the advertiser client precise profiles of the types of individuals responding to the ads. 

### P3P 

The Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) provides a way for Ad Networks and Websites to publish their privacy policies in a machine-readable syntax. An Ad Network or Website will deploy P3P in order to make its privacy practices more accessible to the site’s visitors. A visitor’s Web browser can download the machine-readable privacy statements, and compare the contents of those statements to the user’s preferences. This way, the user’s browser can automatically notify the user when they visit a site whose practices match the user’s preferences – or warn the user if the practices and preferences don’t match. Burst Media has incorporated this technology in their ad servers. Our syntax reflects our current privacy policy. 

### The Cookie Principle

#### Burst Network Publishers: 

Burst may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you are first served a Burst ad, Burst may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire. 

#### AdConductor Publishers: 

AdConductor may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you are first served a AdConductor ad, AdConductor may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that use if you desire.

### Third-Party Measurement Services

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party service provider other than Burst for serving the advertisements and for tracking the performance of an ad program. These companies may employ cookie and 1x1 pixel technology to measure and improve the effectiveness of ads for their client. These companies may collect and use anonymous information about your visits to our member Websites and other Websites. The information collected can include: 

  1. Date/time of your visit 
  2. The banner ad that was shown 
  3. Their cookie 
  4. Your IP address 
  5. The URLs of sites you visit 



This information can also be used for online preference marketing (“profiling”) purposes.

In these instances, Burst has no control over the information collected by the third-party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third-party measurement service where collected information is concerned. 

If you are a Burst Network Publisher and have questions regarding different third-party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact [privacy@burstmedia.com](mailto:privacy@burstmedia.com).

If you are an AdConductor Publisher and have questions regarding different third-party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact [privacy@AdConductor.com](mailto:privacy@AdConductor.com).

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use aggregated information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, click [here](http://networkadvertising.org/consumer/opt_out.asp).

We do not share, sell, rent or trade PII with third-parties for promotional purposes.

### Personal Information 

#### Burst Network Publishers:

Burst regards all personal information collected from its Web publisher members as completely confidential. This includes personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information. Burst does offer to advertisers any data which may facilitate the sale of advertising for a member site. This includes traffic data, click-thru rates, unique visitor information, Web site geographic location, content information, and any demographic information offered by the Web site member for the purpose of facilitating an advertising sale. 

#### AdConductor Publishers:

Burst regards all personal information collected from its AdConductor customers as completely confidential. This includes personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information. 

#### AdConductor Publishers:

We collect information such as name, email and phone number on our site in the “Contact Us” section. This information is used to establish contact with perspective publishers and is only used for that purpose.

#### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as Tax ID number and/or social security number) on our registration or order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). To learn more about SSL, follow this [link](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/SSL.html).  

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can email us at [security@burstmedia.com](mailto:security@burstmedia.com).

### Bulletin Boards/Chat Rooms

If you use a bulletin board or chat room on this site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums. 

### Disclosure 

Burst openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies.

This can be done by logging into your user account and updating your personal information or discontinuing service at anytime. 

Burst Network Publishers can direct their request to [privacy@burstmedia.com](mailto:privacy@burstmedia.com) and we will change the information requested within 30 days.

### Notification of Changes 

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post these changes on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Regardless of later updates, we will never use the information you submit under this current policy in a new way without first providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prevent that use. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
