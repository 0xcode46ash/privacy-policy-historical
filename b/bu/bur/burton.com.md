Your continued use of Burton’s products and services and burton.com constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and any updates. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into, and is subject to, Burton’s [Terms of Use](https://www.burton.com/us/en/help/legal-na.html).

### Collection of Information

We collect information you give us or permit us to access. Such information may include, but is not limited to, your name, image, birth date, email and physical address, telephone number, gender, contact lists, social media information and profile, location (GPS) information, activity and performance information, and when necessary, credit card information. In addition, when you visit our website, we collect standard information about your electronic interaction with us, such as your IP address, browser type and language, operating system, cookie information (described below), web beacons (described below), pages visited on our site, referring and exit pages, and the dates and times of the visits.

Cookies. We may automatically collect information using "cookies." Cookies are small data files stored on your hard drive by a web site. Among other things, cookies help us improve our site and your experience. We use cookies to see which areas and features are popular and to count visits to our site. Many web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies from our site. If you set your browser not to accept cookies or if you reject a cookie, it may affect certain features or services of our site.

Web Beacons. We may collect information using web beacons. Web beacons, or "gifs," are electronic images that may be used on our site or in our emails. We use web beacons to deliver cookies, count visits, understand usage and campaign effectiveness and to tell if an email has been opened and acted upon. If you do not wish for us to track emails we send you, some email services may allow you to adjust your display to turn off HTML or images which may disable tracking, or you may unsubscribe from our marketing emails via contacting Burton’s Rider Services or clicking “unsubscribe” in any marketing email.

### Use of Information Collected from You

Except as set forth below, we will keep all information collected from you, including information collected on burton.com, confidential. We will use the collected information to:

  * Fulfill the services and provide the products you request from us.
  * To enhance or customize your shopping experience with us.
  * To better understand how users access and use our site, both on an aggregated and individualized basis
  * To improve our site
  * To respond to user preferences
  * For research and analytical purposes
  * To send you marketing notices including promotions of our products and services



We also employ other companies to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, providing search results and links (including paid listings and links), processing credit card payments, and providing customer service. They have access to information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.

We also release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements, or protect the rights, property, or safety of burton.com, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction. Obviously, however, this does not include selling, renting, sharing, or otherwise disclosing personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes in violation of the commitments set forth in this Privacy Policy.

Finally, we will release information if we are acquired by or merged with another company, or if substantially all of our assets are transferred to another company, or as part of a bankruptcy proceeding.

### How Secure is My Personal Information?

We have implemented commercially reasonable precautions to protect the information we collect from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction, in accordance with industry practice and applicable laws. Please be aware that despite our best efforts, no data security measures can guarantee 100% security. While we strive to protect information transmitted on or through our site, we cannot and do not guarantee the security of any information you transmit on or through the site and you do so at your own risk.

You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. We are not responsible for any lost, stolen, or compromised passwords or for any activity on your account via unauthorized password activity, except where otherwise required by applicable law.

If you have questions about the guidelines described in this Policy, please email us directly at [info@burton.com](mailto:info@burton.com).
