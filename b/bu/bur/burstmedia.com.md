# BURST! Media Privacy

_**For those who view BURST! advertising**_

Internet user privacy and confidentiality is of the utmost importance to BURST!, our web publisher members, and our advertiser clients. Our reputation and integrity is directly related to how we serve our clients and customers. Please find below a description of how BURST! strives to protect the privacy of Internet users, and maintain the Internet as a highly credible medium.

_**User Information**_

All users who receive an ad served by BURST! retain complete anonymity where BURST! is concerned. As ads are delivered, BURST! does not acquire or collect any personal information about you. Your name, address, phone number, and email address all remain your private properties. BURST! does, however, collect information which is specific to how you use the Internet. BURST! servers note details such as the server you are logged onto, the geographic location of the ISP you use, the type of browser you use, and your IP address. This information is obtained solely for the purpose of targeting ads and measuring a given ads effectiveness on behalf of BURST! clients and customers. 

There are instances where a user may provide specific personal information in response to an ad containing a survey, purchase agreement, or registration questionnaire. For such programs, BURST! (or a third party working in conjunction with BURST! and the advertiser) acquires this information on behalf of the client. This information is used by the client so the user can receive the goods or services requested. When requested, BURST! may employ this information in a compiled format to provide a to the client a precise profile of the type of individuals responding to the ads. 

_**The Cookie Principle**_

BURST! may use cookies to improve your Web browsing experience. When you are first served a BURST! ad, BURST! may assign a unique random number to your computer browser - commonly known as a "cookie." We do this to understand the way a user responds to the ads we deliver. For example, this number lets us keep track of how many times you view an ad we distribute. Likewise, the cookie can help make sure you do not see the same ad over and over - thus enhancing your online Web viewing experience. 

_**3rd Party Measurement Services**_

Often, advertisers will employ a third-party measurement service other than BURST! for tracking the performance of an ad program. In these instances, BURST! has no control over the information collected by the third party, and may not be held responsible for the actions of the third party measurement service where collected information is concerned. If you have questions regarding different third party measurement services and their respective methods of information collection, please contact [webguru@burstmedia.com](mailto:webguru@burstmedia.com). 

_**For Web Publisher Members of BURST!**_

BURST! regards all personal information collected from its members as completely confidential. This includes personal data provided during registration processes and financial account information. BURST! does offer to advertisers any data which may facilitate the sale of advertising for a member site. This includes traffic data, click rates, unique visitor information, web site geographic location, content information, and any demographic information offered by the web site member for the purpose of facilitating an advertising sale.

_**Disclosure**_

BURST! openly volunteers its practices of collecting information, its targeting capabilities, and its use of cookies. If you have any questions pertaining to this privacy policy and its contents, please direct your correspondence to [webguru@burstmedia.com](mailto:webguru@burstmedia.com).
