Our Privacy Policy

Burlington Coat Factory respects your privacy. This is why we are committed to protecting your privacy and using the information you share with us responsibly to better serve you. Our Privacy Policy describes the information we collect about you, as well as why and how we use it to improve your shopping experience with us.

We collect information you provide when you visit our stores or use our web site. For example, we collect information you provide when you place an order, register with us, opt-in to receive our emails, or participate in a service such as gift registries. We may collect a record of your purchases and any other personal or preference information you provide to us. Also, when you visit our web site, we can identify you by your IP address and your domain (not by personally identifiable information such as your name, address, or any financial information on your computer). This allows us to collect aggregate information on which web pages are visited, how frequently, and for how long. We collect and use this information to improve and optimize your shopping experience with us.

Burlington Coat Factory only shares information about our customers with affiliated companies, carefully selected vendors, business partners and other organizations to provide better service to you. These companies need information about you to perform their service function (such as to process and fulfill your order, verify your credit card information, and to protect you from fraud). We also share your information with specially chosen companies that help us with marketing functions (such as manage our Internet business, maintain and manage our customer information, as well as market our products and services). And at times we may share information with other companies that have a product or service that we believe will be of interest to you and/or may help them serve you better.

In certain circumstances, we may share your information in response to legal process or as otherwise required by law.

Links to Other Sites

In some areas of our website, we may provide a link to another website. Other websites have their own policies regarding privacy and security, and these may vary from ours.

Updating your Personal Information

Any time you wish to change your personal information, go to "My Account" at the top of any page.

Protecting your Information

Log out when you are done on the website to protect yourself against unauthorized access to your account. To log out at any time, click the "Log Out" link.

Keep your password safe - do not share it with anyone.

Emails from Us

If you choose to join our mailing list when you place an order, we may periodically send you emails or other marketing communications informing you of promotions and offers. You may opt-out of receiving these communications at any time by changing your preferences on the "Account Information" page in "My Account". If you opt-out, you will still continue to receive order and registry information, answers to customer service questions, and information about changes in our website that might be relevant to you personally.

Children Under 13 Years of Age

It is not our intent to collect personal information about children under the age of 13. A child who is 13 but not yet 18 years of age may use this website only if a parent or legal guardian agrees to be bound by the website's [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20111016065633id_/https%3A//www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/conent/privacy/terms) on the child's behalf. Children under 13 years of age may not use this website.

Cookies and other Computer Information

When you use our website, we place a "cookie" (a small text file) on your computer to identify you. Like many other websites, we use cookies to identify you to provide a more convenient shopping experience. If you wish, you can visit our website without cookies, but then certain features, including adding items to a shopping cart, making a purchase, or using a registry, will not be available.

Security Notice

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In our efforts to protect your online transactions, we use a technology called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). If your browser is capable of SSL (and most are), your personal information will be automatically encrypted, or encoded, before it is sent over the Internet.

BurlingtonCoatFactory.com and BabyDepot.com have digital certificates from Verisign, Inc., a well-known provider of Internet trust services. If you enter any protected part of the website where your personal information is needed, a "closed lock" or other icon will appear in the bottom of the page. Site security information can be seen if you click on this icon. This icon alerts you that your personal information is being encrypted when it is transmitted to BurlingtonCoatFactory.com or Baby Depot.com. Additionally, on all protected pages of our website, the address will begin with https://.

We will never send your credit card information via email.

Notices and Changes

Because our business changes all the time, so does our Privacy Policy and our Security Notice. Please check our website for changes. If you have questions or concerns with respect to our Privacy Policy or our Security Notice, please feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20111016065633id_/https%3A//www.burlingtoncoatfactory.com/content/contact-us).
