The Burpee web site is provided as a service to our customers and to home gardeners across the United States. We do not attempt to capture or solicit any personal information as part of your visit to this site.

  
When you order products or register on the site, we need you to provide your name, email address, mailing address, day phone number and credit card information (when ordering products only), as well as create a user name and password. This allows us to keep a user profile so that we may customize preferences for each specific user, as well as provide a faster method for user to submit information to Burpee and receive back either the information or products desired.

  
Burpee.com logs the user's Internet Protocol Address (IP). An IP address is a number that is automatically assigned to your PC every time you browse the Internet. Information from IP addresses is used for system administration, to examine overall traffic trends, troubleshooting, etc. This information is used only in the aggregate form.

  
Cookies are bits of electronic information that a web site can transfer to a visitor's hard drive to help tailor and keep records of his or her visit to the site. Cookies allow web site operators to better customize visits to the site to the visitor's individual preferences. The use of cookies is standard on the Internet and many major web sites use them. Although most web browsers automatically accept cookies, you can usually change your browser to prevent or notify you whenever you are sent a cookie. This gives you the chance to decide whether or not to accept it. The "cookie" itself does not tell us who you are, your email address or anything else personal. Even without accepting a cookie you can still access most of the features on the site. We use cookies so that they can help provide our visitors with a better experience on our site.

  
To modify your personal information, just go to "My Account" and the information is accessible.
