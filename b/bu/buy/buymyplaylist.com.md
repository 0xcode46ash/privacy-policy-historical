Privacy policy
Last Revised: January 10, 2012
BuyMyPlaylist.com (the “Website” or “BMP”) is a partnership project operated by Znak Inc., a
corporation registered in the State of Delaware, Reg. Nr. 4496595; the USA EIN 27-0403537.
At BMP, we value privacy and want to make your experience online satisfying and safe. This
Policy regards information you provide to us or we learn from your use of this Website. It also
tells you how we may collect, use and, in some instances, share this information with others.
BMP collects:
     1) Information You Provide: You may provide BMP what is generally called "personally
        identifiable" information (such as your name, age, zip code, email address, PayPal or
        other alternative payment method information, credit card number, including Security
        code, postal mailing and billing address, and telephone numbers) if you use certain
        services or products our Platform or otherwise use the features and functionality of the
        Website.
     2) Your User ID/Avatar/Other Social Network IDs: Your User ID, personal profile picture or
        avatar and other BMP names/pseudonyms are displayed throughout the Website and
        are readily available to the public. Other people can see your personal playlists,
        comments, links to your online friends, etc. Therefore, if you disclose or otherwise
        associate your actual name with any of your BMP IDs, the public might be able to
        identify your activities on the Website. In addition, if you use BMP Friends and Followers
        features (as defined in the BMP Terms of Service), we will receive and store your
        Facebook, MySpace, Twitter and other social network user names you might list and
        activate there.
     3) Automatically Collected Information: When you access the BMP or open one of our
        emails, we may automatically record certain information from your system by using
        different types of tracking technology. This "automatically collected" information may
        include Internet Protocol address ("IP Address"), a unique user ID, version of software
        installed, system type, your listening preferences, the content and pages that you access
        on the Website, and the dates and times that you visit the Website.
     4) Cookies : When you access the Website, we may send one or more small text files
        containing a string of alphanumeric characters — known as “cookies” — to your
        computer or other access devices. We do this to help improve your experience of the
        Website. We may use session cookies and persistent cookies or both. A session cookie
        disappears after you close your browser; a persistent cookie remains in your system and
        may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Website. But these
        “persistent” files can be removed if desired. Please review your web browser Help feature
        to learn the best way to modify your cookie settings. Please note, however, that by
        deleting our cookies or disabling future cookies you may not be able to access certain
        areas or features of our site or the access will be much slower.


    5) Links & Embeddable Widget Information: We may display links to third party websites
        and/or embed widgets with your playlist and User ID on other sites. Please note that we
        cannot control and cannot be held responsible for the privacy policies of such websites.
        You should always read the privacy policy of a website to find out more about how
        personal information is collected and processed.

Advertising and Sponsorship.
BMP allows third-party ad servers or ad networks and sponsoring organizations to serve
advertisements and sponsored links within the Website. These third-party ad servers or ad
networks and sponsorship programs may use technology to send, directly to your browser, the
advertisements that appear within the Website, and they automatically receive your IP Address
and other automatically collected information when this happens. Such third-party ad and
sponsorship servers may also use other technologies (such as cookies, javascript, or web
beacons) to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to personalize their
advertising/sponsorship content.
BMP does not provide your personally identifiable information to these third-party ad servers
or ad networks and sponsorship programs without your consent. However, please note that if
an advertiser/sponsor asks BMP to show an advertisement/sponsorship opportunity to a
certain audience or audience segment and you respond to that offer, the advertiser or ad-
server and sponsorship organization may conclude that you fit the description of the audience
that they were trying to reach.
You should consult the respective privacy policies of these third-parties for further information.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the activities of such other
advertisers or programs. BMP reserves the right the add or remove third-party ad networks or
ad servers and sponsorship programs in its discretion and BMP may not at all times list such
updated ad network or ad server, sponsoring partners in this Privacy Policy.

BMP uses commercially reasonable physical, managerial, and technical safeguards to preserve
the integrity and security of your personal information. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to BMP, and you do so at your own risk.
Once we receive your transmission of information, BMP makes commercially reasonable efforts
to ensure the security of our systems. However, this is not a guarantee that such information
may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical,
technical, or managerial safeguards.
If BMP learns of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to notify you electronically so
that you can take appropriate protective steps. BMP may post a notice on the Website if a
security breach occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive
notice of a security breach in writing. To receive a free written notice of a security breach you
