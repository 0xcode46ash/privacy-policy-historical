Effective: 07 July 2006

**1.  ** **Under 18 are not eligible to use our services** and we ask that minors (under 18 years of age) do not submit any personal information to us.   
  **  
2\. Information We Collect.  **Our primary goal in collecting personal information from you is to provide you with a **smooth, efficient, and personalized experience** while using our services. This allows us to provide services and features to meet your needs, and to customize our services to make your experience easier and quicker.

**Certain information** about you is automaticaly tracked about behavior on our site. We use this information to do **internal research** on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand and serve our users. This information is compiled and analyzed on an **aggregated basis**.

Using the Site's web server **log files** , we use IP addresses to analyze trends, track users' movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our site or not), what browser and operating system you are using, your IP address etc.

In addition, **we use cookies** on certain pages of our site. We may also offer certain features that are only available through the use of a cookie. Cookies can also help us provide information which is targeted to your interests. Cookies are stored on your hard drive, not on our site. Most cookies are "session cookies," meaning that they are automatically deleted at the end of a session. The other type of cookie we use is a 'persistent' cookie. This stays on your hard drive and we use this to automatically identify who you are. We use this cookie so that you do not need to log in manually every time you visit the site if you are a registered user. The cookie itself contains no personally identifiable information but it does pass an ID to our server which allows us to tie the cookie to your personal information. We do this to allow us to let you know on the homepage what has changed on the site since your last visit. We also use the cookie to track how often you visit the site so we know who our most loyal users are. You are always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, although in that case you will not be able to use certain features on our site. For example, if you disable cookies, you will need to log in manually each time you visit the site as we cannot use a cookie to remember who you are. Some of our business partners (e.g. net-filter.com; hitbox.com) use cookies on our site. These are used to monitor site performance and to measure site traffic and usage. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by E-consultancy only and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

 **Surveys:  **From time-to-time our site may request information from users via surveys, contests or for a particular service (e.g. newsletter). Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested will include contact information (as supplied to the site during registration) and supplementary information on your professional interests, opinions and preferences. We will use the contact information to notify winners. We will not publish winners' details on the site though on request we will provide details of any winners' name and organization. If the survey or contest has a sponsor then we will share information given by entrants with the sponsor.  
  
**3\. Our Use of Your Information.  **We may use personally identifiable information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to **statistically analyze site usage** , to improve our content and product offerings and to customize our site's content, layout, and services. We believe these uses allow us to improve our site and better tailor it to meet our users' needs.

We may use your **e-mail address** to send you newsletters or other communications (for example, digests of the forum posts) that you have requested from the Site. Out of respect for our users we offer an opt-out (see 4. below).

We may use information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to resolve any disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our User Agreement. At times, we may look across multiple users to identify problems or resolve disputes, and in particular on rare occasions we may evaluate your information to look for users using multiple User IDs or alias.

 **  
4\. Opt-Out of Email Communications  **If at any stage you wish no longer to receive any e-mails that you receive from the site you can stop them coming by using the opt-out or link attached to the bottom of each email.  
**  
5\. Our Disclosure of Your Information  **Unfortunately, due to the existing regulatory environment, we cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

By way of example (without limiting the foregoing), we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to **law enforcement** or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

As a general proposition, **we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable information about you to any third party.**

**Advertisers:** We do **aggregate** personally identifiable information and disclose such information in aggregate to advertisers and for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situations, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could be used to personally identify you.

**Legal Requests:** Our Company cooperates with law enforcement inquiries and other third parties to enforce laws, intellectual property and other rights. Local and international law enforcement agents can request and may receive your personally identifiable information.

**Suppliers and Other Service Providers:**  From time to time we use third party Suppliers and Service Providers to facilitate our services. Where any Service Provider collects information directly from you (such as the situation where we ask a Service Provider to conduct a survey for us) you will be notified of the involvement of the Supplier or Service Provider, and all information disclosures you make will be strictly optional. 

 **  
6\. "Tell a friend" services  **Our site offers a service whereby you can e-mail site content to a friend or colleague. This will involve entering the e-mail address of your friend. **We do not use the e-mail addresses you enter for any purpose other than to send your e-mail.** We do not store, rent or sell these e-mail addresses.  
**  
7\. Other Information Collectors  **Except as otherwise expressly discussed in this Privacy Policy, this document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties, whether they are other members of the Site or other sites throughout the Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the personal information you disclose to them.   
**  
8\. Security  **In order to process and protect your credit information, we use SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption. The secure server is hosted by [Thawte](http://www.thawte.com/ssl-digital-certificates/trusted-site-seal/siteseal_consumer.html) and not us.     
  
On the Denny Hecker sites we use best endeavor to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identifiable information but we do not use encryption (such as SSL) or firewalls to further protect the information as it travels across the Internet. This is because we do not believe that, apart from the credit card information processed by Thawte, the personal information we currently collect warrants such measures and the accompanying loss of speed experienced. You should be aware that "perfect security" does not exist on the Internet.

 **. Downloadable Software Disclaimer  **The Thawte program covers only information that is collected through this Web site, and does not cover information that may be collected through software downloaded from the site.
