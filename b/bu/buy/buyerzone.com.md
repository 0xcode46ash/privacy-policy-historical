**Third party links**   
In an attempt to provide increased value to our visitors, BuyerZone.com may choose various third party web sites to link to from its own site. However, even if the third party is affiliated with BuyerZone.com, BuyerZone.com has no control over these linked sites each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices, independent of BuyerZone.com's practices. BuyerZone.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. These linked sites are only for your convenience and you access them at your own risk.

**Third party Incentive or Reward Programs**   
BuyerZone.com may offer, from time to time, third party incentive programs in order to provide you with additional value when you make purchases on site. Participation in a program may require that you register with a vendor in order to redeem your incentive(s) or reward(s) under the program(s). In registering for one of these programs you will be subject to the privacy policies administered by the vendor's site. These policies can be viewed at the vendor's home site. BuyerZone.com has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions and is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of the vendor sites or any other third party incentive or reward program offered on our site.
