**Information Collection and Use**

BuyerZone.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. BuyerZone.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site.

**Registration**

To use this Web site, you must first complete the registration form. During registration you are required to give your contact information (such as name, e-mail address, company, company size, and ZIP code). This information is used to contact you about the services on our site for which you expressed interest. It is optional for you to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as Social Security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site. 

**Ordering**

We request information from you on our order form. Here you must provide contact information (name and shipping address) and financial information (credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with you.

**Cookies**

A cookie is a piece of data stored on your hard drive containing information about you. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, you would not have to enter a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If you reject the cookie, you may still use our site without any drawbacks. Cookies also enable us to track and target your interests to enhance your experience on our site.

Some of our business partners (for example, advertisers) use cookies on our site. However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.

We use both session cookies (cookies which expire upon your exiting our site) and non-session cookies (cookies which do not expire as you exit our site; in our case they last seven days). The only 3rd-party cookies served on our site may be from our advertisers. These cookies are of both the session and non-session type.

**Log Files**

In log files we collect your IP address, referring site URL, time, and date.

We use IP addresses, etc. to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movements, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. 

**Sharing**

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person.

We use outside shipping companies to ship orders and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

We partner with both online quoting vendors and online shopping vendors to provide specific services. When you sign up for these services, we will share names or other contact information that is necessary for the third party to provide these services. These parties are not allowed to use personally identifiable information, such as e-mail and postal address or phone number, except for the purpose of providing these services.

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, BuyerZone.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

**Newsletter**

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter, we ask for contact information such as name and e-mail address. 

**Surveys and Contests**

From time to time, our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address) and demographic information (such as ZIP code and age). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of our site.

**Tell-A-Friend**

If you elect to use our referral service to inform a friend about our site, we ask you for the friend's name and e-mail address. BuyerZone.com will automatically send the friend a one-time e-mail inviting him/her to visit the site. BuyerZone.com stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time e-mail. The friend may contact BuyerZone.com at [custcare@buyerzone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065118id_/http%3A//www.buyerzone.com/services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml) to request the removal of this information from our database.

**Discussion Forums and Live Help**

BuyerZone.com hosts discussion forums, where you can post your opinions about business products and services and read the opinions of others. The information disclosed in the public view is limited to the participant's username, posted comment, and date of posting. 

We offer a live help function on our site to assist you with our services and the quoting services of our partners and affiliates. Our live help is a one-on-one private chat. We do not store the transcripts of these chats. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect your information. When you submit sensitive information via the Web site, your information is protected both online and off-line.

When our order form asks you to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or Social Security number), that information is encrypted and protected with the best encryption technologies in the industry -- SSL and PCP. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to unlocked, or open, when you are just 'surfing.'

While we use encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information off line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desks. When they return, they must re-enter their password to regain access to your information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up to date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment, behind a locked cage.

If you have any questions about the security at our Web site, please send an e-mail to [custcare@buyerzone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065118id_/http%3A//www.buyerzone.com/services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml).

**Supplementation of Information**

In order for this Web site to properly fulfill its obligation to you, it is necessary for us to supplement the information we receive with information from 3rd-party sources.

**Credit Check:** For example, to determine if your proposed use of a credit card is valid, we may use your name and address to request a credit validation. Once we have determined the card use is valid this document is destroyed. 

**ID and Business Verification:** We may use information from a third party to verify users’ identities or authenticate your business to maintain the integrity of Buyerzone.com. 

**Special Offers**

We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and newsletters. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see choice/opt-out below.

**Site and Service Updates**

We also send you site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with you to provide requested services and address issues relating to your account via e-mail or phone.

**Correction/Updating Personal Information:**

If your personally identifiable information changes, like your ZIP code, or if you no longer desire our service, we will provide a way to correct, update, or remove your personal data. This can usually be done at Buyer's tools ([http://www.buyerzone.com/services/myzone/index.html](https://web.archive.org/services/myzone/index.html)) or by e-mailing [custcare@buyerzone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065118id_/http%3A//www.buyerzone.com/services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml).

**Choice/Opt-out**

You are given the opportunity to 'opt-out' of having your information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. For example, our order form has an 'opt-out' mechanism so that if you buy a product from us, but don't want any marketing material, you can keep your e-mail address off of our lists. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletters or promotional materials from our partners, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by following the unsubscribe links in the e-mail, visiting Buyer's tools ([http://www.buyerzone.com/services/myzone/index.html](https://web.archive.org/services/myzone/index.html)) or e-mailing [custcare@buyerzone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065118id_/http%3A//www.buyerzone.com/services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml).

You are always notified when your information is being collected by any outside parties. We do this so you can make an informed choice as to whether you should proceed with services that require an outside party.

**Insurance Disclaimer**

BuyerZone.com is not an insurance broker. If you request a quote, you are not buying insurance from BuyerZone.com, and this form is not intended to be a substitute for an insurance application. Quotes presented through BuyerZone.com are non-binding, and full disclosure and agreement to the exact terms of your policy is exclusively between you and the vendor. BuyerZone.com neither endorses nor recommends any specific insurance coverage plan or insurance broker. 

**Legal Disclaimer**

Though we make every effort to preserve your privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary in order to conform to a court order or comply with a legal process served on our Web site. We will provide prior notification of such request(s) either by e-mail or written notice.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on our homepage so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify you by e-mail. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. You can choose not to have your information used.

We always welcome your questions and comments about our privacy policy. To send us feedback, please contact [custcare@buyerzone.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20030622065118id_/http%3A//www.buyerzone.com/services/feedback_form/feedback.jhtml).
