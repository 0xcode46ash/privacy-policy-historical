#### Last modified: April 29, 2009

BuyWithMe, Inc. takes very seriously the private nature of your personal information. The privacy of all BuyWithMe users is very important. This Privacy Policy describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit our Website and/or register to be part of our group shopping experience. Please read this notice carefully and do not hesitate to let us know if you have any questions. 

This Privacy Policy applies to all of the products, services and websites offered by BuyWithMe, Inc. or its subsidiaries or affiliated companies (collectively, BuyWithMe “services”). It is designed to help you understand how we collect and use the personal information you decide to share. By using or accessing [www.buywithme.com](https://web.archive.org/pages/privacy), you are accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy. 

Please note that this Privacy Policy may change from time to time. We will generally post any Privacy Policy changes on this page

### How We Use Your Email Address 

When you sign up for our mailing lists, a BuyWithMe account, or other service or promotion that requires registration, you will be required to provide a valid email address. We will only use this email address to contact you as part of the transaction process, to send you periodic emails that you have subscribed to, or for purposes that are intended to enhance your user experience. We may also occasionally contact you to obtain feedback on a specific merchant deal you have participated in. We will not share your contact information with third parties unless you have opted-in to receiving communications from those third parties, such as in the process of purchasing a voucher. 

### Opt-out

BuyWithMe will generally allow you to choose to not receive certain types of email communication from us, except for those that are absolutely necessary. Emails will generally contain a link at the bottom to be removed from our mailing list. 

### How We Use Your Name 

When purchasing a voucher, you may be required to provide the full name of the person who will use it, whether that will be you or the person who will receive the voucher as a gift. We will only share this name with the merchant listed on that voucher. Your full name may be used by the merchant for the purposes of verifying that the voucher is valid. We will also collect your full name during the checkout process to verify your credit card payment info. When signing up for our mailing lists, a BuyWithMe account, or other services or promotions that require registration, you may also provide your name at that time so that we can personalize all communications you receive from us. 

### How We Use Your Financial Information 

For certain services, such as our merchant deals, we also request credit card or other payment account information which are maintained in encrypted form on secure servers. 

We do not share this information with any third party except for those companies responsible for processing credit card transactions for us. 

### How We Use Your Demographic Information 

We will occasionally collect demographic data, such as zip code, gender, and occupation. Providing this information is typically optional but helps us bring you the best deals possible. We use this data to help determine which deals our users would most appreciate. We may also share this data with third parties, such as merchants featured on our site, but only in aggregate. No third party will be able to trace your personal demographic information back to you unless you have given your permission to do so. 

### How we use information collected from various third party sources 

We may combine information you submit under your account with information from other BuyWithMe services or third parties in order to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may give you the opportunity to opt out of combining such information. Facebook By logging into the BuyWithMe website using your Facebook credentials, you will be giving BuyWithMe access to certain general personal info stored in your Facebook profile. We will not view or store any data available to us from your Facebook profile without first presenting you with the option to choose for us to not view or store it. Your ability to edit the information obtained from Facebook upon signup is a clear part of our account registration process. 

At various times on BuyWithMe.com, you will be able to easily share our content with your Facebook friends. We do not view or store lists of your friends, nor do we view or store the specific messages that you send to your friends. However, we may record the number of times that particular content has been shared.

### Sharing functionality 

At various times, you will be able to easily share content on our site using the share feature. This functionality is provided by a third party; see [http://sharethis.com/privacy/](https://web.archive.org/pages/privacy) for their privacy policy. We do not view or store the specific messages that you send through this feature, but we may record the number of times that particular content has been shared. 

### Cookies, Web Beacons and Unique URLs 

Like most sites, BuyWithMe makes use of browser "cookies." Cookies are small text files placed on your computer's hard disk by our server. They allow us to quickly check your status as a subscriber and facilitate access to your preferences. BuyWithMe will never use cookies to retrieve information from a computer that is unrelated to our site or services. 

BuyWithMe also may use transparent GIF images in emails we send to you. We use these images to track the viewership of emails we send. We may also create unique links in emails to let us know which emails are clicked on. 

### Your IP Address 

We may occasionally collect and store your IP address. This helps us diagnose problems with our servers, administer our site, gather non-personal information about our users, and detect and prevent fraudulent activity. It does not identify you personally in any way. 

### Information sharing 

BuyWithMe only shares personal information with other companies or individuals outside of BuyWithMe in the following limited circumstances: 

  * We have your consent. We generally require opt-in consent for the sharing of any sensitive personal information. 
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing personal information on our behalf. 
  * We have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of BuyWithMe, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share this data with third parties in an aggregated, non-personal form. Such information does not identify you individually. 

### How to access and update your personal information 

Although we take reasonable steps to ensure that all data we use is accurate, we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.
