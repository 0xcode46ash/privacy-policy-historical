**Cookies**

When you use Bugaboo websites, Bugaboo and/or third parties may gather information about your use of this and other websites, for instance by means of cookies. A cookie is a small file that is sent along with pages of a website and stored on your computer hard drive by your browser. The cookie then allows your browser to be recognised when you make repeated visits to a website.

  
The information that Bugaboo and/or third parties gather, for instance by means of cookies, may be used for the following purposes:

  1. For functional purposes: to facilitate logging into or navigating Bugaboo websites or to remember your settings and/or preferences when using Bugaboo websites.  
Example: you log into a website and our system knows via a cookie that you are logged in upon your next visit to the same website. You therefore do not have to login again.

  2. For analytical purposes: in order to analyse the use of Bugaboo websites.  
Example: record can be kept of how many visitors visit a specific web page, so that Bugaboo knows which of its websites, or parts of its websites, are popular.

  3. 3\. For commercial purposes: to keep record of how many and which advertisements you are shown (i.e. to prevent you from always seeing the same advertisement) and to be able to check whether you have clicked on an advertisement.  
Example: you may be shown a commercial for a video. In order to prevent you from seeing the same commercial each time, a record can be kept of the commercials that have already been shown to you.

  4. 4\. For targeting purposes: in order to build up a profile of you, based on your web-browsing behaviour, so that advertisements which are matched to your existing and probable interests can be displayed. This profile can also be built up on the basis of information of your visits to other websites.




The information gathered by Bugaboo based on the above can be combined with the personal data processed by Bugaboo. However, the information gathered by third parties is not linked to the personal data processed by Bugaboo. Bugaboo does not make use of and has no access to this information gathered by third parties. The use of cookies and other techniques by these third parties, as referred to above, is subject to their own privacy policy, which is mostly set out on their own website(s).
