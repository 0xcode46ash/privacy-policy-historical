**The Way We Use Information**

When placing an order, the personal information we collect serves a single purpose: to complete that order. We want only enough information to process your payment, open the lines of communication, and ship your product to your desired location. We do not share this information with outside parties, except to the extent necessary to complete that order (i.e. processing a charge or providing shipping info, or confirming delivery).

Your personal information be used in only these ways:

  * Processing monetary transactions

  * Establishing and confirming shipment

  * Sending and receiving relevant emails

  * Contacting you should there be a delay or problem with your order




Third party information, such as that which is needed for the creation of a gift-card, will only be used for that specific purpose. The relevant information is disclosed exclusively to the appropriate person / gift recipient and never to an outside party.

**Your Email Address**

Email addresses are used exclusively to maintain the line of communication between our company and you. Your email address - nor any information attached to it - will NOT be sold, traded, or published in any way.  
You may choose or refuse to receive newsletters, updates, and sale information on our new products and services. Unless you fill out the appropriate registration form while purchasing a product, information you submit to our website will not be used for this purpose.
