We do not ask for your real name and it is up to you whether you allow people to view your email address.

### **Hostel  Reviews**

If you wish you may post hostel reviews with your own name and email address which will be visible to all other people reading hostel reviews. However we do not force you to reveal your identity and you may post anonymous reviews if you wish to.

BUG is running a promotion where we send a free t-shirt to users who post 20 messages to the forums or 20 hostel reviews. We will collect an address which is used to post the  
t-shirt. We do not keep this address and will not use the address for any other purpose.
