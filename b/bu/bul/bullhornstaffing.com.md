### Cookies

When you interact with Bullhorn we strive to make that experience easy and meaningful. When you log on to Bullhorn, our Web server sends a cookie to your computer. Cookies are files that Web browsers place on a computer's hard drive and are used to tell us whether customers have used the Service previously. Standing alone, cookies do not identify you personally. They merely recognize your browser.

There are two types of Cookies: session and persistent-based. Session cookies exist only during an online session. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include such information as a unique identifier for your browser.

Bullhorn uses session cookies containing encrypted information to allow the system to uniquely identify you while you are logged in. This information allows Bullhorn to process your transactions and requests. Session cookies help us make sure you are who you say you are after you've logged in and are required in order to use the Bullhorn application. Bullhorn uses persistent cookies that only Bullhorn can read and use, to identify the fact that you are a Bullhorn customer or a visitor, who has registered for the Bullhorn Community or to receive certain types of content. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information stored in persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies. Users or visitors who disable their Web browsers' ability to accept cookies will be unable to use all aspects of our service or the Community.

We make it easy for you to invite people from your email address books or Microsoft Outlook account to join you on our Site. At your request we will search your email address book to help you import your contacts to our site.

This feature is to send contacts an email correspondence or to keep their information as a contact in the Bullhorn Staffing application.

### Bullhorn Safe Harbor Privacy Policy Statement

Bullhorn is committed to the highest standards of data privacy rights for its customers and partners. In addition to our web privacy policy, Bullhorn self-certifies with the U.S. Department of Commerce's EU Safe Harbor Framework which concerns the transfer of data from the European Union to the United States. Bullhorn acknowledges and adheres to the privacy principles set forth in the Safe Harbor Framework in respect to all data transferred from the EU to the U.S. Additional information regarding Safe Harbor can be viewed at the Department of Commerce's site, <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

Bullhorn complies with the U.S. - E.U. Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from European Union member countries. To learn more about the Safe Harbor program, and to view Bullhorn's certification, please visit <http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/>.

The Department of Commerce's Safe Harbor Framework provides a set of principles that support the EU Data Directive of data protection. The following principles are part of Bullhorn's privacy protection process and are used in the collection and handling of data from the European Union.

  * Notice - Bullhorn will disclose the type of information being collected, its purpose, and any third party with whom data may be shared.
  * Choice - Bullhorn will offer the opportunity of individuals to opt-out of any transfer of data to third parties or use of collected data for purposes other than originally stated for and authorized.
  * Onward Transfer - Any disclosure of information by Bullhorn to third parties will make the Notice and Choice principles applicable to the transfer. Transfer of data to parties acting as agents of Bullhorn will only be done if the third party itself meets the requirements of the Safe Harbor Framework or has been deemed adequate by the EU.
  * Security - Bullhorn takes reasonable precautions in its protection of data and any misuse, loss, destruction, alteration, and unauthorized access or disclosure.
  * Access - Bullhorn will provide access to personal information to individuals and allow them to correct, amend, or delete information where it is inaccurate unless the cost of such access is prohibitive in relation to the risk of privacy or where the rights of another individual would be violated.
  * Data Integrity - Bullhorn takes reasonable steps to ensure that any personal data it collects is relevant for the purpose it is being used and that the information is reliable, accurate, complete, and current.
  * Enforcement - Bullhorn will attempt to resolve any privacy concerns directly with individuals. In the event a resolution cannot be made, individuals may engage Bullhorn's independent recourse mechanism, ([TRUSTe](https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request)).
