# Bullring Birmingham - Be At The Centre

We will only share your Personal Information outside the Bullring family of companies and franchisees with your consent – as required by law or to protect Bullring, its customers or the public, with companies that help Bullring fulfill its obligations with you, and then only with partners who share Bullring’s commitment to protecting your online privacy.

In each of the instances above, we may ask for your Personal Information in order to provide you the services or offers. In the case of actions listed above, you will be able to “unsubscribe” to these at any time. It is completely optional for you to register, participate or otherwise provide us with Personal Information in the above situations.

### How your information is used

Bullring will not disclose or transfer your Personal Information to third parties without your consent or as otherwise set forth in this privacy policy. If you have opted-in we may use your Personal Information to respond to specific requests and to send notices of new products, special offers and other marketing materials to enhance and support your relationship with Bullring. These communications may take the form of postal mail, telephone calls, e-mail and other methods of contact. Also, agents, service providers and other contractors of Bullring who will have access to your Personal Information are required to keep the information confidential and not use it for any other purpose than to fulfill the services they are performing for Bullring.

### Unsubscribing and data removal

If your Personal Information changes (such as post code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if you no longer desire to be contacted about our products and services, you can correct, update or delete/deactivate your Personal Information at any time. We take your online privacy very seriously, so if you need any assistance in unsubscribing to future communications please contact Bullring. We will promptly take action to ensure that you are “opted-out” from receiving any further mailing or other information. Although we will remove your name from our e-mail list as quickly as possible, please recognise that there may be a period of time after you unsubscribe during which you may still receive e-mails from us.
