1\. What visitor information does bulbs.com gather or keep track of? Why?

We gather information with the following objectives in mind:  


  1. To fulfill your order accurately and quickly.
  2. To learn how we can improve your purchasing experience.
  3. To help us meet our commitment to privacy.
  4. To facilitate convenient re-ordering each time you visit bulbs.com.

Information You Yourself Enter:  
When you visit bulbs.com, you have the option of getting a bulbs.com username. Getting a username is easy:  


  1. You enter your name and e-mail address.
  2. You choose your own username (we check that somebody else isn't already using it).
  3. You choose and confirm a password, or you can ask us to remember you automatically.



By getting a bulbs.com user name, you get free access to these valuable features:  


  * Unlimited access to your personal account history, saved for easy re-ordering/account review.
  * Get access to special promotions and our newsletter.
  * View delivery details, tracking, and order-status instantly.



If you choose not to get a username, you can still see prices online, but you can't get a full quote (i.e., case lot discounts or volume purchase discounts related to your order). You must have a username to place an order from bulbs.com.

At any point while you're browsing, you can record an item in your personal account. When you're done browsing, you can revisit your personal account, and if you want to place an order, you indicate the item(s) and click the **Click to Pay** button. This takes you to a screen which asks for shipping information: name, address, and preferred contact time/method in case we need to get in touch with you about your order. The same screen also gives you a price quote for the item(s) you're ordering, including price, any applicable sales tax, discounts, promotions, handling, and delivery costs (applicable only if a shipping method other than UPS Ground is selected).

The **Complete Order** button then takes you to a screen which offers options for payment: you can enter credit card information, or you can opt to contact us by e-mail or phone about paying by (Check, Money Order, Purchase Order).

The information gathered as part of your purchasing is used _only_ to process your purchase. The only information that is ever shared with anyone is:  


  * Credit card or check information, with the financial institution that processes your payment
  * Your name/company, the contents of your order, and transaction number with our distributor
  * Shipping information, with the shipper.



Your information may also be collected from the Job Opportunities page (email address and resume), Contact Us (email and name), and Ask Dr. Bulb (email, name, and optional phone number).

Information Tracked Automatically  
When you log onto the Internet, your computer connects to your Internet service, declaring its on-line presence by requesting an IP (Internet protocol) address-- sort of like asking for an assigned seat in an electronic classroom. Your Internet service's computer responds by placing you at a particular set for the session. Some providers assign you a permanent or "static" IP address, but most use temporary ones. This helps assure your privacy, because it's difficult-to-impossible to collect personal information about you via a temporary address.

Our site keeps a general list of visitors' IP addresses. This gives us broad, generic information such as how many AOL® users log onto bulbs.com, and it helps us maintain bulbs.com's compatibility with many different Internet services.

bulbs.com records browser types and versions so we can answer questions such as, "How many of our visitors were using Internet Explorer 4.0® last month?" That tells us what portions of our site visitors can and can not use, motivating us to keep our web site up to date.

We record how many people visit each page on our site. This helps answer questions such as, "What items or pages are drawing a lot of interest this month?"

We may also record which site or search engine referred you to bulbs.com. This information enhances your shopping experience: images look better, pages load more quickly, and bulbs.com remains compatible with more browsers and systems.

Why we use Cookies  
When you visit bulbs.com, we send you back a _cookie_ \- a list of data which enhances your shopping convenience. This information is only available to be sent back to the computer that sent it to you so that you can create a list of those items you are purchasing.

2\. What does bulbs.com do with this information?

bulbs.com is deeply committed to keeping your information secure. We use the information you share with us to fulfill your order or inquiry and to keep you up-to-date on the status of your order. bulbs.com will automatically inform you via email of the completion of your order the moment it is shipped out to you.

The financial institution processing your payment may send us supplemental information if a problem is encountered while completing your transaction. Likewise, the shipping carrier may send us supplemental information if a problem is encountered during/with delivery. This information is used only in processing your order(s) from bulbs.com.

If you sign up for our optional newsletter, we'll send you email messages from time to time announcing what's new and exciting at bulbs.com, including special offers and promotions. Every email newsletter from bulbs.com includes instructions for unsubscribing.

Information about your browser helps us improve our site's appearance and currency/compatibility with your system. We need traffic reports (information about sites that refer visitors to us) so that we can select the best places to reach people interested in shopping for light bulbs online.

3\. Does bulbs.com ever share such information? With whom?

We do not sell, rent, share, trade or give away any of the information you provide us, with exception to the financial institution that processes your payment and the shipping carrier that delivers your order. No third party will solicit you as a result of the information you provide to us.

bulbs.com offers you an email link on the **Help** page, so you can write to us with comments or ask for information. Any email you send us is kept confidential and will not be posted on our site without your written permission.

In the unlikely event that bulbs.com, Inc., or substantially all of its assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets. 

4\. Can I tell bulbs.com _not_ to gather or keep track of information I've provided? How?

Yes. You can set your browser not to accept cookies, but if you do you will not be able to place orders online. If you place an order online and your browser is set to receive cookies, we have the ability to review which pages/items you viewed on our site and requested quotes for.

You always have the option of placing your order via phone, fax or postal mail. Please see the **Help** page on bulbs.com for details on how to do this.

If you've opted to receive our email newsletter, you'll find instructions for removing yourself from our subscriber list at the end of each newsletter.

If you would like to change, correct, or update information about you or your order in any way prior to shipment, please contact our Customer Service representatives at 1-888-455-2800.

If you have subscribed to our email newsletter and would like to change the email address for your subscription, please follow the instructions in the newsletter for un-subscribing with the old address, and then re-subscribe with your new email address.
