BulkRegister reserves the right to change this Privacy Statement and its policies prospectively at any time, subject to applicable laws and regulations, by posting notice of such changes on its web sites.

**Privacy:** BulkRegister is committed to safeguarding the information its members entrust to it. As a sign of our commitment to protect consumer privacy, BulkRegister has submitted a certification for participation in the Safe Harbor program between the United States and the European Union. BulkRegister subscribes to the Safe Harbor principles published by the U.S. Department of Commerce.

**The Personal Information We Collect:** BulkRegister may collect personally identifiable information from members in a variety of ways, including online and offline subscription and order forms, paper or telephone submissions, and other instances where members are invited to volunteer such information. Additionally, contact information may be collected during any correspondence relating to member support, as well as in connection with products and services offered on BulkRegister sites. We collect your name, business name and type, address, phone number, email address, billing information including credit card number and expiration date. We only use your name, address, billing information/credit card information to process your order. The addresses are used for customer support, required notifications, product and policy updates and marketing releases. Under no circumstances will we use this information for anything else not described in this privacy notice. All users may at any time opt-out of our marketing by clicking the unsubscribe link located at the bottom of all marketing and membership notices.

**Financial Information:** Whenever members apply for web hosting services or sign up for any other product or service through BulkRegister, we require financial information such as a credit card number and billing address before we will process that application. We will not sell, share or rent any financial information collected except as disclosed in this policy or as necessary to fulfill orders.

**Protocol (IP) Addresses:** IP addresses are collected from all visitors to the BulkRegister Site. IP addresses are used to administer the daily operations of our site, to help diagnose problems with our servers, and to help prevent fraud.

**Data Integrity:** We make diligent efforts to maintain accurate information on our members. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, BulkRegister has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. Each new member email address is verified prior to receiving authorized passwords. ICANN mandated WhoIs verification notices are sent out annually for review to ensure accuracy.

**Data Security:** BulkRegister has put stringent security procedures in place to protect information collected about our members. We constantly monitor our systems, which are protected using industry-standard security measures. Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") connections are used to communicate to our system to protect Member financial information as well as encrypting vital information that members input through BulkRegister's web sites. However, BulkRegister cannot guarantee that the information submitted to, maintained on, or transmitted from our systems will be completely secure.

**Data Access:** Member's may access all personal identifiable information that we collect and maintain by logging into their member account or contacting the customer support department 24/7, support@bulkregister.com. To protect privacy and security, BulkRegister reserves the right to take reasonable steps to verify Member identity prior to granting access or processing changes or corrections.

**Cookies:** BulkRegister uses "cookie" technology in order to enhance our Members' online experience and for authentication purposes, associating them with your personally identifiable information. They are also used for measuring certain traffic patterns, and to preclude you from having to re-enter your user handle or password during multiple visits to the site. Additionally, cookies can track your progress in online promotions so you receive coupons that may be available to you. Cookies may also be used by advertising service vendors that place ads on our site and to authenticate access to additional services provided by BulkRegister at other web sites. Web browsers may be set to disable cookies, but please note that certain BulkRegister services may not function correctly if cookies are not enabled.
