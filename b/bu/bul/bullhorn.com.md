### Bullhorn's Privacy Statement

**Responsibility**

Bullhorn.com is committed to respecting your privacy. We've structured our websites so that, in general, you can visit Bullhorn.com on the Web without identifying yourself or revealing any personal information. Once you choose to provide us personally identifiable information (any information by which you can be identified), you can be assured that it will only be used to support your customer relationship with Bullhorn.com.   
This statement regarding the privacy of the information you provide online covers five main areas: Awareness, Choice, Access & Accuracy, Security, and Oversight. 

**Awareness**

Bullhorn.com provides this Online Privacy Statement to make you aware of our privacy policy and practices and of the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. To make this notice easy to find, we make it available on our Bullhorn.com homepage and from any page where we collect information from you. 

**What we collect**

On some Bullhorn.com web pages, you can register for services, make requests, and submit comments or questions. The types of personal information collected at these pages may include name, contact and billing information, transaction, and credit card information. 

**How we use it**

Bullhorn.com uses your information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, to update you on service and benefits, and to personalize information we deliver to you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are never retained for other purposes. 

**Who we share it with**

We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you do not wish to receive unsolicited marketing research requests from us and we will do everything we can to honor such requests.

Your permission is always secured first, before we ever share your private information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy. 

**Access & Accuracy**

Bullhorn.com strives to keep your personally identifiable information accurate. We make every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may update or correct your information at the Bullhorn.com site where it was submitted.
