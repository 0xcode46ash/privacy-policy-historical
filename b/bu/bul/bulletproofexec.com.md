# » Privacy Policy The Bulletproof Executive

Effective on December 4, 2011

BulletproofExec.com is committed to your privacy. We disclose our information practices below and we agree to notify you of:

1. What personally identifiable information of yours or third party personally identification is collected from you through BulletproofExec.com.

2. The organization collecting the information.

3. How the information is used.

4. With whom the information may be shared.

5. What choices are available to you regarding collection, use and distribution of the information.

6. The kind of security procedures that are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of information under BulletproofExec.com control.

7. How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.

If you have questions or concerns regarding these statements, you should contact customer support by email.

At BulletproofExec.com we protect your privacy as if it were our own. We use the information you provide to us for five purposes only: to process your order(s), to reply to your questions, provide our newsletter via email, to facilitate a transaction you chose to enter into with our third party partner(s) and to incorporate your feedback into improvements to our Web site. We will not give, sell, or rent your personal information, including email address, or specific account activity to anyone for any reason without your prior consent except as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web site.

**Our Secure Ordering**

Bulletproofexec.com uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to ensure the privacy of your personal information. When you make an online purchase, our advanced security technology encrypts and scrambles your personal data (including your name, delivery and e-mail addresses and credit card number) before it is sent to us, making it virtually impossible for anyone other than bulletproofexec.com to read it. Unless specifically authorized by you, no outside party is able to access or receive any of your personal customer information.

To make sure you are accessing our secure server before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower left or right corner of your browser, or to the right of the location bar or the address bar in newer browsers. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), the SSL is active. To double-check for security, look at the location line or your browser. If you have accessed a secure server, the first characters of the address in that line should change from “http” to “https.” Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through a secure server like the ones we use at bulletproofexec.com. If for any reason you cannot access the secure server, please feel free to contact us via email at store@bulletproofexec.com. It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer. Bulletproofexec.com wants you to feel completely comfortable. If you have more questions about our security systems please send us an email at store@bulletproofexec.com and we will be happy to help you.

Bulletproofexec.com does not store your personal information or your payment information.

**Credit Card Fraud Protection**

All major credit card companies protect cardholders against fraud, subject to a $50 deductible. BulletproofExec.com will protect you for this $50 portion in the highly unlikely situation that you ever encounter an inappropriate charge involving BulletproofExec.com.

**Information We Collect**

In designing our website, we started with the simple belief that customer service is our number one priority. Therefore the customer information we collect is used to enhance our services to you, our customer.

When you visit our website, we collect non-personal information about your visit. We collect your IP address, browser type, domain name, and we log the length of time of your visit and the number of times you visit and purchase from us. We assign you a unique internal identifier to help keep track of your future visits. We use this information to gather aggregate demographic information about our visitors, and we use it to personalize the information you see on our website and the emails you receive from us (should you grant us permission to send to you). We keep this information for our internal use; we do not share it with others. This information is in no way tied to your personal information, including your email address.

Our Web site uses cookies to store information between users’ visits to our site and for the duration of the visit, also known as a session. Cookies are a mechanism to remember information about a visitor when he or she navigates from one Web page to another. Our Web site uses cookies to hold users’ unique session identifiers, allowing our Web server to serve correct information back to the user. Such information includes the user’s shopping cart items, or whether he or she is logged in when requesting to view or modify personal information, including your email address, which may have been stored in our database in the past. Our Web site cookies do not hold any personal identifiable information. Disabling or rejecting cookies will prevent users from adding items to the cart and checking out; however, standard browsing on our Web site does not require cookies.

BulletproofExec.com uses tracking technologies to send anonymous information about your browsing habits to a third party company. Links in our email communications to recipients are tracked via Web Beacons once you land on our website. Web Beacons appear on our website as 1×1 transparent images which transmit information such as your operating system, browser, resolution, geographical location, products ordered, and order total. This information is used to help our webmasters and marketers understand the behavior of visitors to our website and understand the effectiveness of online and email messages. Your information is submitted anonymously, and no sensitive or personally identifiable information is transmitted.

When you subscribe to our newsletters, BulletproofExec.com asks you for contact information (your name and email address). When you sign up for our newsletters we use your name and email address to send you our newsletters and to inform you of sales and special offers. When you submit a product review on our website, you are required to log into your customer account. Your comments and first name will be displayed. However, no information that would allow others to contact you will be disclosed by BulletproofExec.com. Your information will be used for no other purpose than to allow you to submit product reviews.

**Recommend product to a friend**

The information collected (friend’s name and email address) is used to send a one time only email to the friend letting them know about the product that the user recommends.

**Ordering**

If you place an online order, our secure order form requests contact, billing, and shipping information. Contact information from the order form (email address, name, billing and shipping address, and phone number) is used to send orders and information about our company to you. Your contact information, including email address, is also used to get in touch with you should we have questions regarding your order or should we need to notify you of the status of your order. And yes, you can opt not to get email from us, as described in the opt-out section below. For your convenience, your order history is stored on a secure server. You will automatically be registered to receive our newsletter unless you opt-out during account creation. You may opt-out at any later time by following the unsubscribe instructions in the newsletter.

We have several types of third-party relationships:

1. We use third-party intermediaries. When you purchase from us, we send your the billing and shipping information that you provide on BulletproofExec.com to our payment processor, PayPal.com.

2. We use outside shipping companies to fulfill orders. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information, including email address, for any other purposes.

3. BulletproofExec.com handles the sending of order related and customer service related messages internally, as well as advertising related emails. BulletproofExec.com service providers do not retain nor use your personal information, including your email address for any other purpose except to provide the service on our behalf.

**Opt-Out**

If you decide that you would like to opt-out from receiving newsletters from us, our emails provide you with the opportunity to stop receiving these communications.
