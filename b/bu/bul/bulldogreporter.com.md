### INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Passive and Active Collection**. When you visit our Web Sites we collect and keep track of certain information that is not readily personally identifiable, such as the domains from which people visit us, IP addresses and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Web Sites and our services. There are also times when we may need information from you, such as your name and address, in connection with providing you certain services. For example, in order to access our software-as-a-service products, we need to collect and maintain user names and email addresses to manage login authentication and to otherwise manage your user experience. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from you on the Web Sites. 

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**. There are various technologies, including one called “cookies”, which are used by us and our Affiliates to analyze trends and gather statistical data about our users. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can control the use of cookies via your individual browser, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Web Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Web Sites may be limited. 

### WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT

If you provide us with PII, we will use that information as intended by you or as permitted by law. For instance, we will use PII provided as part of the subscription process to our services, to provide our services to you, to personalize your experience with us, to keep you informed of our products and services that may be of interest to you, and to reach you when necessary regarding issues concerning your use of our services. We also use your IP address for information technology support, to administer our services, and to gather demographic information. We may aggregate the information we collect (including your PII) for trends and statistical purposes. We reserve the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate data about our Web Site users for lawful purposes.
