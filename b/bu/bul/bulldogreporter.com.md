# Website Privacy Policy - Agility PR Solutions

+ We use cookies to ensure that we give you the best experience on our website. By continuing to navigate on this website, you accept the use of cookies. 

At Agility PR Solutions we understand the importance of your privacy. This Privacy Statement discloses the privacy practices for the Agility PR Solutions website ([agilitypr.com](https://agilitypr.com/)) and all other internet properties and subdomains (collectively the “Web Sites”) belonging to Agility PR Solutions LLC or any of its Affiliates (the “Company”, “us” or “we”). Each time you access or use the Web Sites you agree to this Privacy Statement in its entirety.

“Affiliate” means a legal entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the Company, but only while that control relationship exists; “control” means the direct or indirect ownership or control of 50% or more of the stock or other equity interest entitled to vote for the election of directors or equivalent governing body.

## INFORMATION WE COLLECT

**Passive and Active Collection**. When you visit our Web Sites we collect and keep track of certain information that is not readily personally identifiable, such as the domains from which people visit us, IP addresses and other anonymous statistical data involving your use of the Web Sites and our services. There are also times when we may need information from you, such as your name and address, in connection with providing you certain services. For example, in order to access our software-as-a-service products, we need to collect and maintain user names and email addresses to manage login authentication and to otherwise manage your user experience. It is our intent to let you know before we collect personally identifiable information (“PII”) from you on the Web Sites.

**Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies**. There are various technologies, including one called “cookies”, which are used by us and our Affiliates to analyze trends and gather statistical data about our users. A cookie is an element of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then store it on your system. You can control the use of cookies via your individual browser, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it. If you reject cookies, you may still use our Web Sites, but your ability to use some features or areas of our Web Sites may be limited.

## WHAT WE DO WITH INFORMATION WE COLLECT

If you provide us with PII, we will use that information as intended by you or as permitted by law. For instance, we will use PII provided as part of the subscription process to our services, to provide our services to you, to personalize your experience with us, to keep you informed of our products and services that may be of interest to you, and to reach you when necessary regarding issues concerning your use of our services. We also use your IP address for information technology support, to administer our services, and to gather demographic information. We may aggregate the information we collect (including your PII) for trends and statistical purposes. We reserve the right to transfer and/or sell aggregate data about our Web Site users for lawful purposes.

## CORRECTING AND UPDATING PII

You may access, correct, update or delete your PII by contacting us as set forth in the “Questions” Section below. We will make a sincere effort to respond to such requests in a timely manner. We may need to verify your identity before granting access to PII in our custody and control.

## HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

We share your PII with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Statement or as otherwise permitted by applicable law. We may share your PII with our Affiliates. We also sometimes hire other companies to provide certain business related functions (“Service Providers”). These Service Providers have access to PII as necessary to provide their respective services to us.

We also may disclose PII: (a) in response to a lawful request by public authorities, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; (b) under a good faith belief that such disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud or respond to a government request; (c) in connection with a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event (in this case, PII may be a part of assets transferred from our company to the acquiring company); and (d) to any third-party as set forth herein or with your prior consent to do so.

## BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

The Web Sites may contain links to other websites. The Company is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such Web sites.

## PRIVACY AND SECURITY

We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and organizational procedures to maintain the security of the information we retain. However, no Internet or e-mail transmission is ever fully secure or error free so please keep this in mind when deciding what information to send to us.

## INTERNATIONAL TRANSFER

The Company operates globally so it is necessary to transfer your information internationally. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize the Company to use your information in any country where the Company operates. By using the Web Sites you consent to your information being collected, used and transferred as set forth in this Privacy Statement.

## OPT-OUT/OPT-IN

Unless an exception applies, you may opt-out as to whether your PII is (i) to be disclosed to a third party (that is not acting as an agent and/or on behalf of the Company); or (ii) to be used for a purpose other than the purpose for which the PII was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. You may communicate this opt-out by contacting us as set forth in the “Questions” Section below.

In the event the Company collects Sensitive Information directly from you, and unless an exception applies, the Company will provide you the opportunity to affirmatively or explicitly consent (opt in) to the disclosure of the Sensitive Information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected or subsequently authorized by you. “Sensitive Information” means PII that specifies medical or health conditions, personal sexuality, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious, ideological or trade union-related views or activities, or information on social security measures or administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions (which are treated outside pending proceedings).
