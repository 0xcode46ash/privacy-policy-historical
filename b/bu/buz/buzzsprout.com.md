The data you put into Buzzsprout is yours. We’ll only ever access your account to help you with a problem or fix a software issue. We log access to accounts by IP address. This allows us to verify that no unauthorized access has happened for as long as the logs are kept.

### Your Personal Information

We'll also store any information you voluntarily submit (for example, filling out a survey) for the duration of the research project or as long as it makes sense.

When you sign up for Buzzsprout, we ask for your name and email address. This allows us to personalize your new account, and send you invoices, updates, or contact you concerning your account. We’ll never give nor sell your personal information to third parties.

All data is encrypted via [SSL/TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) when transmitted between our servers and your browser. Our database data isn’t encrypted (because it needs to be available quickly), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest.
