## BuzzDash Privacy Policy

_We take your privacy very seriously at BuzzDash and are committed to providing users a high standard of control and transparency with regard to their personal information._

**What This Privacy Policy Covers**

This policy covers how BuzzDash treats personal information that it collects and receives, including information related to your past use of BuzzDash services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable, like your name or email address, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that BuzzDash does not own or control, or to people that BuzzDash does not employ or manage. BuzzDash partners may have their own privacy statements, which we encourage users to review by clicking on their respective links.

**Information Collection and Use**

**_General_**  
BuzzDash may collect personal information when you register with BuzzDash, use BuzzDash products and services, or visit the pages of certain BuzzDash partners. BuzzDash may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies. When you register, we may ask for information such as your email address and other optional information such as gender, date of birth and state of residence. Once you register with BuzzDash and sign in to our services, BuzzDash collects information about your interactions with us and with some of our business partners. BuzzDash automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser, including your IP address, BuzzDash cookie information and the pages you request.

BuzzDash uses information for the following general purposes: to provide you with general analysis of voting results, such as by major demographic groups (e.g. men vs. women), customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.

**_Information Sharing and Disclosure_**  
BuzzDash does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances: 

We may provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with BuzzDash under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help BuzzDash communicate with you about offers from BuzzDash or our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 

We may respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of BuzzDash's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 

We may transfer information about you if BuzzDash is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, BuzzDash will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

BuzzDash may display targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click on targeted ads meet the targeting criteria. BuzzDash does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad, you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

**_Cookies_**  
BuzzDash may set and access BuzzDash cookies on your computer. BuzzDash may let other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies' use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to BuzzDash's cookies. BuzzDash may also use web beacons to access BuzzDash cookies inside and outside our web site and in connection with BuzzDash services.

**Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences**

**_General_**  
You can edit your BuzzDash account information at any time. We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to the BuzzDash service, such as service announcements and administrative messages, that are considered part of your BuzzDash account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

**_Confidentiality and Security_**  
We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs. We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

**_Changes to this Privacy Policy_**  
BuzzDash may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your BuzzDash account or by placing a prominent notice on our site. 

**_Questions and Suggestions_**  
If you have questions or suggestions, please email them to .

Effective Date: April 1, 2008
