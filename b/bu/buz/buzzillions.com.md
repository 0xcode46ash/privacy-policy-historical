Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy (this " **Policy** ") describes how personal information is collected from users of the Buzzillions website at http://www.buzzillions.com (the " **Site** ") and the Bazaarvoice product reviews and ratings service (" **Review Service** "), operated by PowerReviews, LLC., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bazaarvoice, Inc. (" **Bazaarvoice** ," " **we** ," or " **us** ") and how that information is used and disclosed. The Review Service is provided both through the Site and through third party sites via framing techniques as described below (" **Third Party Sites** "). We encourage you to read this Policy carefully before providing any personal information on the Site or Review Service. 

Bazaarvoice has received TRUSTe's Privacy Seal signifying that this privacy statement and our practices have been reviewed for compliance with the TRUSTe program viewable on the validation page available by clicking the TRUSTe seal. The TRUSTe certification covers information collected through www.buzzillions.com. 

The United State Department of Commerce and the European Commission have agreed on a set of data protection principles and frequently asked questions (FAQ) to enable U.S. companies to satisfy European Union (EU) law requirements for adequate protection of personal information transferred from the EEA to the United States. The privacy principles in this policy are based on the Safe Harbor Principles and Bazaarvoice adheres to the Safe Harbor Principles as outlined below.

Information We Collect

We collect "personal information" about users of the Site and the Review Service in the normal course of our business. As used in this Policy, "

personal information" is information that identifies or is capable of being associated with an identifiable person. Some examples of personal information include a user's name and email address. Personal information does not include aggregate information or de-identified information. "Aggregate information" is information about the use of the Site, such as information collected about Site users, or a category of services or users, from which any personal information has been removed. An example of aggregate information would be a report stating that forty-seven percent of the Site's registered users identify themselves as male. 

Most of the personal information we receive comes directly from users who register on the Site, use the Review Service or who otherwise voluntarily provide information to us in connection with various activities on the Site or Review Service. The information we request at registration includes name, e-mail address, and birth date. We may also collect other types of information in connection with your other activities on the Site, such as information about or contained in postings you make in forums or any other interactive areas of the Site, your answers to surveys, your participation in sweepstakes, contests, games and promotional offers; and in any email request you send us for any reason (such as to request customer service or provide us with comments or feedback). Also, we request your email address when you submit a product or service review using the Review Service (whether through our Site or a Third Party Site) and if you provide it, we send an email message to you confirming that you submitted the review. 

We also automatically collect some information when you use the Site or Review Service. We log your IP address. If you reached the Site by clicking on a link or advertisement on another site, we also log that information. This helps us understand our users' interests and maximize our online exposure. All of this information is collected and used only as aggregate information; that is, it is entered into our database, where we can use it to generate overall reports on our users, but not individual reports that identify you personally. 

Framed Content

The Review Service may be displayed on or through Third Party Sites with the use of inline frames or other framing techniques. We may collect personal information in such framed pages or content located on or provided by Third Party Sites. When you submit personal information to us in this manner, it is treated as personal information under this Policy. The collection and use of personal information by the Third Party Site directly (i.e., outside of the Review Service framed pages) is governed separately by the privacy policy of such site. 

Cookies, Web Beacons, and Similar Technologies

We may use cookies to identify Site and Review Service users and to customize their experiences on the Site and Review Service. We also use cookies to help us understand how visitors use (and to help us to improve) the Site and Review Service and provide such information to our clients and partners through reports and other analytics tools. You may refuse to accept cookies from us by following the procedures specific to your Web browser. If you do so, your browser may react strangely and you may not be able to use some services on the Site or Review Service. 

Bazaarvoice firmly believes in the importance of online privacy and is a member of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Through the Site, we collect and use, and allow other third parties to collect and use, information about you to provide you a more enriched online experience by (i) creating advertisements, (ii) delivering advertisements to websites on behalf of advertisers, (iii) monitoring and managing advertising campaigns, and (iv) presenting you with advertisements that are more likely to be interesting and relevant to you. 

Bazaarvoice's technology may be deployed on other websites to collect information that may be used for online ad tailoring purposes or to deliver an advertisement to you from a company whose website you have visited in the past. Bazaarvoice's technology may employ cookies and Web beacons to collect non-personally identifying information, such as information related to advertising campaign results, in the course of providing its clients with its ad-serving services and for the purpose of helping its clients determine which advertisement is suitable to be delivered to you. This non-personally identifiable information collected through a cookie may be shared with our customers for their advertising purposes and may be combined by them with other data, including personal information, in possession of our customers. 

The use of cookies by third parties is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. ****Web beacons, also known as "Web bugs," are small, graphic images on Web pages or Web-based documents or in email messages that allow us or third parties to monitor who is visiting the Site or Review Service. Web beacons collect the IP address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to, the URL of the page the Web beacon comes from and the time it was viewed. Web beacons may be linked to your personal information. If you would like more information about these practices and to know your choices about not having this information used by these companies, please click[ here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp). ****

As is true of most Web sites, we and our third party tracking-utility partners use log files to gather certain information. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and clickstream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. **

How We Use the Information We Collect

We use the information we collect to: 

**

  * contact you for administrative purposes or provide you with customer service;
  * complete transactions requested by you or to verify that you have submitted a review to our Review Service; 
  * respond to any questions, problems or complaints, or request feedback;
  * organize the Site and Review Service to better serve you and customize or develop our products and services; and 
  * send you emails containing information about products and services that you might find of interest.
  * to investigate and help prevent potentially unlawful activity or activity that threatens the network or otherwise violates the Usage Agreement;
  * From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site and may use a third party provider to administer them. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. 



Personal information provided on our Site or through the Review Service may be linked together or merged with other personal information we obtain about you so that we may better understand your needs and inform you about our products or services and those of our business partners. In addition, if we receive personal information from third parties with whom we have business relationships, we may combine this information with the other personal information we maintain about you. In either case, this Policy governs this information. 

Disclosure of Information

We do not rent, sell or disclose personal information to third parties without your prior consent, except as described in this privacy policy. We may share personal information when we have your consent to do so, when required by law, when required to protect our rights or property, as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested, or for marketing purposes. We reserve the right to use and disclose any non-personal information that we collect. We may use third party service providers to assist us with the administration of the Site or Review Service or to perform other services for us, including transaction processing and sending email. These third parties may be given or may have access to your personal information, but agree to receive and use such information solely to provide services to us or on our behalf. 

We may use third parties, called third-party ad servers or network advertisers, to deliver ads to you on our behalf. These third-party ad servers may use cookies, web beacons or other technology to collect non-personally identifiable information about your visits to our Site or the Review Service in order to use it to present advertisements that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice or whether you can opt out of having this information used by third-party ad servers to provide targeted ads, please visit http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp 

Information about our users, the Site and the Review Service is a business asset of Bazaarvoice. Therefore, information about our users, including personal information, will be disclosed as part of any (a) merger or acquisition, (b) creation of a separate business to provide the Site or our Review Service, or to provide other services or fulfill products; (c) debt financing, sale or pledge of company assets, or (d) insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership in which personal information would be transferred as one of Bazaarvoice's business assets. 

We may release personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or court order); to enforce or apply our policies or any other agreement with a user; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to protect our users from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful use of our Site or its services; to enforce contest, sweepstakes, promotions, or game rules; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay. 

We send to your web browser many of the advertisements you see when you use our  Web site. However, we also allow other companies, called third-party ad servers or ad networks, to serve advertisements within our web pages. Because your web browser must request these advertising banners from the ad network Web site, these companies can send their own cookies to your cookie file, just as if you had requested a web page from the site. Please note that if an advertiser asks us to show an advertisement to a certain audience (for example, men ages 18-34) or audience segment (for example, men ages 13-24 who have viewed sports content) and you respond to that ad, the advertiser or ad-server may conclude that you fit the description of the audience they are trying to reach. As always remember, we only authorize our third-party ad servers to employ anonymous cookies for ad delivery and anonymous targeting. Our third-party ad servers do not collect, nor do we give them access, to any personally identifying information about you. 

Access to Personal Information

If your personally identifiable information changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, delete/deactivate it by logging into your account and making the appropriate changes or by emailing us at privacy_info@powerreviews.com.

Data Retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. 

Public Forums

As part of our service, we provide you with the opportunity to provide publicly posted reviews or post in our blog. You should be aware that any information you provide in these reviews or blog comments may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from these public forums contact us at privacy_info@powerreviews.com. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.

Facebook Connect

You can log in to our site using sign-in services such as Facebook Connect or an Open ID provider. These services will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form.  Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. 

Social Media Widgets

Our Web site includes Social Media Widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

Opting Out of Third-Party Ad Servers

If you want to prevent a third-party ad server from sending and reading cookies on your computer, currently you must visit each ad network's Web site individually and opt out (if they offer this capability). 

Currently, we have relationships with the following third-party ad networks (click to visit their Web site):
