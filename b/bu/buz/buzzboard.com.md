## Tracking Technologies

  * ## Log Files

a

BuzzBoard also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests, and favorites using log files.

There is also information about your computer hardware, tablet hardware and software that is automatically collected by BuzzBoard. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, geo-location, actions on the platform, and referring website addresses. This information is used by BuzzBoard for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding the use of BuzzBoard website and/or BuzzBoard and/or other BuzzBoard products and services. For these purposes, we do link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information such as name, email address, address, and phone number.

  * b  


## Cookies

The BuzzBoard website uses “cookies” to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web server. Cookies are not used to run programs, or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.

  * c  


## Advertising

We partner with a third party ad network to either display advertising on our website, or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our ad network partner uses cookies and web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information about your activities on this and other websites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. If you do not wish to have this information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt out by clicking here [https://preferences.truste.com/](https://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served advertising. You will continue to receive generic ads.

  * ## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

We employ [or our third party advertising partner employs] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. web beacons/web bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on web pages, and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We tie [do not tie] the information gathered by clear gifs to our customer’s personally identifiable information.

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications, and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns.
