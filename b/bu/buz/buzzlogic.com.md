**STATEMENT OF RESPONSIBLE ONLINE MARKETING**

BuzzLogic’s information usage practices are based on two beliefs: first, that protecting user privacy is essential to the growth and prosperity of the Internet; second, that a personalized web experience can provide significant benefits to Internet end users if done properly. In accordance with these beliefs, BuzzLogic creates results for advertisers and publishers in revolutionary ways without compromising individual privacy. If you have questions or concerns regarding this statement, email us at privacy@BuzzLogic.com.

**I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT**

BuzzLogic, Inc. is the corporate entity that manages the BuzzLogic marketing, technology and analytics company . The BuzzLogic Site is not directed towards individual Internet consumers nor does it seek any personally identifiable information (”PII”) from such consumers. PII may be collected should a consumer contact BuzzLogic on his/her own accord and volunteer PII. Like most standard website servers, we use log files to collect Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, and date/time stamp. We use the information to analyze site usage, administer the site, understand usage and navigation trends in aggregate, and determine the relevance of content.

**II. INFORMATION MANAGEMENT**

BuzzLogic may share information with its affiliated entities for or in connection with the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial asset, reorganization or liquidation of any of the BuzzLogic companies. BuzzLogic also may release information when we believe release is appropriate to respond to a subpoena or otherwise comply with the law; enforce or apply our agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of BuzzLogic or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection.

**III. CONSUMER CHOICE AND ACCESS**

Because the BuzzLogic Site is not directed towards individual Internet users and does not use cookies, we do not maintain a process for an individual consumer to review and/or request changes to any PII collected.

**IV. SECURITY**

BuzzLogic employs industry standard security measures to ensure the security of all data. Any data that is stored on BuzzLogic’s servers is treated as proprietary and confidential and is not available to the public. BuzzLogic has an internal security policy with respect to the confidentiality of customer and other data, allowing access only to those employees or third parties who have a need to know such information for the purpose of effectively delivering BuzzLogic products and services by means of user login and password requirements. BuzzLogic routinely evaluates its data security practices to identify security threats or opportunities for improvement.

No transmission of data over the Internet, however, is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of BuzzLogic to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your information, BuzzLogic cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. You acknowledge and assume this risk when communicating with us.

**V. CONSENT AND CHANGES**

BuzzLogic may find it necessary or be legally obligated to update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will post those changes on this page and update the effective date so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. Except as otherwise required by law, modifications to this Privacy Policy will not affect the privacy of data collected by BuzzLogic prior to the effective date of the policy change unless we provide you direct notice and the opportunity to opt-out.

It is our policy to prohibit the sending of unsolicited or “Spam” e-mail by BuzzLogic or any of its marketing partners.

**VII. DATA PROCESSING/SAFE HARBOR**
