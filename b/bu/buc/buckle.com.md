**Data Privacy:** We care about the privacy of our guests. When you provide us with information about yourself, The Buckle, Inc. may use that information for our own internal marketing purposes. We may request information from you about your fashion tastes, your hobbies or your music interests. This information will be collected from you directly. Using the information you give us, we may contact you with information or special offers. We will not require you to disclose more information that is reasonable necessary to participate in an activity as a condition or participation. The Buckle, Inc. will not sell or disclose personal information to outside third parties. If you do not wish to be contacted by us in the future, simply reply to the unwanted e-mail message and type "Remove" in the subject reference line.

We value our relationship with our guests of all ages. We welcome parents and their children to explore our site together and participate in our online drawings, Buckle Talk e-mails and other promotional activities. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we are requesting that any guest who is under 13 years of age provide us with the name and e-mail address of a parent or guardian whom we may contact in order to obtain consent prior to collecting or using any personal information from such pre-teen guest. The Buckle, Inc. will contact the parent or guardian via e-mail and request his/her consent for the pre-teen’s registration and The Buckle, Inc.’s internal use of such information. A parent or guardian may view the pre-teen’s registration information, ask to have it deleted and/or refuse to allow any further collection or use of the pre-teen’s information. Any such requests should be directed to Webmaster@buckle.com.

**Transaction Security:   **We have made every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the use of a secure server. With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the card must be the one who places the order.

The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) for securing communications and transactions across the Internet.  The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure, confidential communications "pip" between the purchaser and our web entity.  Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering.  A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window identifies the security mode of a browser.  When the browser is running in "normal" mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open.  Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is not in "secure" mode.  SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption.
