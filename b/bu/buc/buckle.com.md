#### Privacy & Security

Privacy & Security Policy  
The Buckle, Inc. cares about the privacy of our Guests. Our goal is to provide the best shopping experience possible for our Guests, and we strive to achieve that goal through our Internet shopping experience. Buckle.com collects client information to enhance your shopping experience. 

General Browsing  
Buckle.com gathers navigational information about where our visitors go on our web site and information about the technical efficiencies of our web site and services (i.e. time to connect to our web site, time to download pages). This information allows us to see which areas of Buckle.com are most visited and helps us to better understand our Guests’ experience at Buckle.com. This helps us to improve the quality of our visitors’ online shopping experiences by recognizing and delivering more of the features, services and products our visitors prefer. In the process of gathering navigational information, non-personally identifiable information (i.e. domain type, browser version, service provider and IP address) may be collected which will provide information regarding a visitor’s use of our web site (such as the time of a visitor’s last visit to a page on our web site).

If you cancel an order or do not complete an order, we may collect and use any email address or other information that you have entered as we would collect and use it if you had completed an order. For example, if you shop Buckle.com and leave the site without completing your order, we may follow up through email with a reminder. 

Collection, Use and Disclosure of Personal Information   
We collect information from you, which you provide to us at this web site when you establish or update an account, enter a sweepstakes, participate in a survey, shop online or create or send a wish list. Categories of information collected include name, address, email address, recipient’s email address, telephone number, credit card information and messages you create. This information is used to enable Buckle.com to deliver products that you have ordered, to fulfill requests that you have created, to contact you or the recipient(s) in the event of order or delivery difficulties, for verification, to respond to your inquiries and to deliver services and information about our products or web site to you. We use third parties to help us provide services, such as processing payments, monitoring site activity, conducting surveys, maintaining our database, administering and locating emails, and assisting in administering sweepstakes.

If you opt into our email list or make a purchase through Buckle.com, the information you provide (for example, name, address, and credit card) will be added to a database. The Buckle, Inc. may use that information for our own internal marketing purposes. We may request information from you about your fashion tastes, your hobbies or your music interests. This information will be collected from you directly and openly. Using the information you give us, we may contact you with information or special offers. We will not require you to disclose more information than is reasonably necessary to participate in an activity as a condition of participation. The Buckle, Inc. does not sell or disclose _the_ personal information _of any of our guests_ to outside third parties without _the guest's consent._ [Revised]

Buckle.com continually strives to maintain compliance with legal regulations. If we become aware of or have a good faith belief that we must disclose information about you in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringement, piracy, or other unlawful activity, we will disclose specific information about you to the appropriate legal authorities in order to protect the users of our Web site, the site, and/or the public.

World Financial Network National Bank (WFNNB) issues and owns the Buckle Card credit card accounts. If you apply online for a Buckle credit card, you will be providing your personal information directly to WFNNB and the information you provide to WFNNB would be subject to WFNNB’s privacy policies.

Privacy Policy for Minors  
We value our relationship with our Guests of all ages. We welcome parents and their children to explore our site together and participate in our online drawings, free email newsletters, games, shopping and other promotional activities. In accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, we will not gather or use personal information from any Guest who indicates they are less than 13 years of age (or less than 18 years of age for residents of the state of Maine). We invite their parent or guardian to assist the pre-teen Guest in any sweepstakes or ordering activity online with Buckle.com. If we become aware that we’ve gathered personal information from a minor, we will remove that information from our records immediately. 

Use of Cookies  
Buckle.com uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which is placed on your computer. Cookies are small amounts of data that are transferred to your computer by our server. The cookies are stored on your computer’s hard drive and are used by Buckle.com to help track your clicks and pass information as you go through the pages within the Buckle web site and provide a more personalized experience. Buckle.com also uses cookies to help keep track of how many items you put into your shopping bag and to tell us whether you have previously visited Buckle.com. Cookies allow Buckle.com to make our site more responsive to your needs, by delivering a better and more personalized experience to you. Most browsers automatically accept cookies. We do not recommend you disable your cookies.

We also use a technology known as clear gifs, which are typically stored in emails, to help us confirm your receipt of, and response to, our emails and to provide you with a more personalized experience. If you register or purchase product through Buckle.com, we may associate navigational information from your previous browsing visits with the personal information you provide.

In addition, we carefully select third party advertising companies and allow them to collect non-personally identifiable information by placing cookies when you choose to visit Buckle.com. This information is used to report marketing program effectiveness directly back to the Buckle, Inc. This information is used in aggregate form and is not in any way personally identifiable.

We have carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, which will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will educate us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate around our site, responses to email, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information. Buckle.com does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information. Coremetrics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it back to Buckle.com through a secure web connection. The information and analysis will be used to assist us in better understanding your interests in our web site and how to better serve those interests and provide you with more personalized product offerings. Coremetrics is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purposes or matching it against any other information in its possession. Coremetrics is required to maintain all information collected and its analysis in confidence. For more information, including how to opt-out, consult Coremetrics’ privacy policy by clicking the following link: [Coremetrics - Privacy Policy.](http://www.coremetrics.com/company/privacy.html)

Buckle.com’s Email List  
Joining Buckle.com’s email list allows you to receive exclusive information about special offers, media events, new products and much more. If you’re not already registered, simply complete our [sign-up form](http://www.buckle.com/cheetah/join.jsp?bmUID=1262746012505) to receive these special messages. You may also opt-in to our email database through our physical stores at the cash register. Those names are electronically added in batch to our email database weekly. If you have opted-out of our email database in the past but have more recently opted back into our email database through the store register, we will renew your subscription at that time. If at any time you would like to stop future delivery of Buckle.com’s email messages, please follow the removal instructions located at the bottom of each email message. This will not prevent you from receiving email communications relating to any online order you place at Buckle.com, requests to participate in surveys about our products or other operational email communications.

Buckle.com will never ask you through email to provide personal information including credit card numbers, passwords, mother’s maiden name, bank account numbers, ATM pass codes or social security numbers. The best way to protect yourself from phishing scams is for you to avoid supplying personal information to any email request. If you believe the request might be legitimate, please call the company’s customer service department to verify this before providing any information, but do not use phone numbers contained in the email (if any are included).

Applicability of Privacy & Security Policy  
This Privacy & Security Policy applies only to the information collected online at Buckle.com.

Should there be a material change in the categories of information collected at Buckle.com or a material change in how we use information collected at Buckle.com (whether a deletion or addition), for a thirty day period after the change we will note deletions with a strike-out and additions in italic type. Further, for this same period we will note [Revised] at the end of the revised sentence or sentences and update the effective date at the bottom of the Privacy & Security Policy. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit our site often for this and other important announcements about Buckle.com. If you have submitted your email address to us for email contact, we will notify you should our policy change. You will then have an opportunity to opt-out of any new use of your information.

Security Statement  
We have made every effort to ensure that the information transmitted to us online is secure through the use of a secure server. With respect to online sales, the person whose name appears on the card must be the one who places the order. The Buckle uses secure sockets layer (SSL) encryption for securing communications and transactions across the Internet. The SSL protocol uses digital certificates to create and secure confidential communications “pip” between the purchaser and our web entity. Data transmitted over an SSL connection can not be tampered with or forged without the two parties becoming immediately aware of the tampering. A key or padlock icon in the lower corner of the browser window identifies the security mode of a browser. When the browser is running in “normal” mode, the key looks broken or the padlock looks open. Once an SSL connection has been established, the key becomes whole, or the padlock becomes closed, indicating that the browser is in “secure” mode. SSL is supported in the vast majority of browsers, which means that almost anyone with a browser can benefit from SSL encryption. In addition, it is our policy not to send your credit card number via email. In fact, this is a practice we recommend you adopt in all of your internet activities.

While we implement the above security measures on this site, you should be aware that 100% security is not always possible.

This Privacy & Security Policy supersedes all prior policies and is effective January 5, 2010.
