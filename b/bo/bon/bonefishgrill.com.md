## Online Behavioral Advertising

We may use third parties to serve OSI Restaurants (Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Fleming's and Roy's) advertisements on other websites. In serving OSI advertisements, these companies may use cookies and other tracking devices to collect certain information about your visits to other websites (such as browser type, IP address, which page was visited, and time of day). This information may be used to evaluate our online advertising campaigns or to tailor promotions and other marketing messages to you.

Some of these ads are online behavioral advertising and may contain cookies that allow monitoring of your response to our advertisements. Cookies placed by these companies do not collect personal information. We limit companies that place our ads from using information for any purpose other than to assist us in our advertising efforts. If you prefer that our advertising service providers not know which website pages you have viewed, you may find out more at <http://www.networkadvertising.org/> about how you can opt out. To learn more about online behavioral advertising, privacy, cookies, visit <http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/learn_more.asp>.

Please note that if you opt out, you are only opting out of the collection of data through cookies, you may still receive online advertising from OSI Restaurants (Outback Steakhouse, Carrabba's, Bonefish Grill, Fleming's and Roy's). Opting out from a specific advertising provider only means that the ads you do receive will not be based on your preferences or behavior.

In order for behavioral advertising opt-outs to work on your computer, your browser must be set to accept cookies. If you delete cookies, buy a new computer, access the Sites from a different computer, login under a different screen name, or change web browsers, you will need to opt out again. If your browser has scripting disabled, you do not need to opt out, as online behavioral advertising technology does not work when scripting is disabled. Please check your browser's security settings to validate whether scripting is active or disabled.
