We advertise in a number of ways, including online through managed social media presences, and on other unaffiliated sites and mobile applications, and offline through shipping centers, call centers, and direct marketing. To understand how our advertising campaigns are performing, we may collect certain information via our Sites through our advertising service providers. We or our vendors use several common online tracking tools to collect this information, such as browser and flash cookies, web beacons and other, similar technologies. The information we collect includes IP addresses, the number of page visits, pages viewed via our Sites, search engine referrals, browsing activities over time and across other websites following your visit to one of our Sites or applications, and responses to advertisements and promotions on the websites and applications where we advertise. 

We also use certain information to:

**Controlling Our Tracking Tools**

Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies. How you do so depends on your browser and the type of cookie. Certain browsers can be set to reject all browser cookies. If you configure your computer to block all cookies, you may disrupt certain web page features and limit the functionality we can provide when you visit or use our Sites. If you block or delete cookies, not all of the tracking that we have described in this policy will stop. Some browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. These browser features are still not uniform, so we are not currently set up to respond to those signals. 

For more information on our tracking tools, please see our [Cookie Policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20170616021624id_/http%3A//crossborder.fedex.com/us/assets/cookie_policy.shtml).

**Controlling Online Interest-Based Ads**

We sometimes work with online advertising vendors to provide you with relevant and useful ads. This may include ads served on or through our Sites. This may also include ads served on other companies' websites. These ads may be based on information collected by us or third parties. For example, your postal code when you register for a website. This might be used to target an ad for people in your area. These ads may also be based on your activities on our Sites or on third party websites. 

For more information about our ad service provider and its cookies, including information about how to opt out of these technologies, you may visit [http://www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

**Retailers and Other Third Parties.** We work closely with online merchants who use our Sites to provide their international shopping cart functionality. If you arrived at one of our Sites through a third party retailer or other FedEx Cross Border client or affiliate (the "Retailer"), we share the Personal Information we collect from you with the Retailer. You do not need to register with us to use the services we provide to Retailers. In addition, as described in our Cookie Policy, the Retailer may also set a cookie and collect information from you. And we may retain your Personal Information to resolve disputes, comply with legally mandated reporting, disclosure, or other legal process requirements. The Retailers are located in the United States or other countries that may not be considered adequate by data protection authorities in your home country. Before proceeding with your transaction, read the Retailer's Privacy Policy to understand how it may collect, process or disclose your Personal Information. This policy does not apply to Retailer websites accessible through our Sites.

**Third Party Service Providers.** We use other companies and individuals to perform certain functions on our behalf. Those functions include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal or electronic mail, analyzing or hosting data on cloud-based servers, processing payments, providing customs brokerage services, or customer service/call center support. We may disclose your Personal Information to these companies and individuals performing services on our behalf.

**For California consumers.** Under California's "Shine the Light" law, California residents may **opt-out** of a company's disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for its direct marketing purposes. You may choose to opt-out of our sharing your Personal Information with third parties for marketing purposes at any time by calling us at +1.203.683.4894. This opt-out request does not, however, prohibit disclosures made for other non-marketing purposes.

**Sale of the Businesses.** If we sell all or part of our business, your Personal Information may be transferred to the purchaser in connection with that transaction in compliance with applicable law. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to include contractual provisions that require the purchaser to treat your Personal Information consistent with this Privacy Policy.

**Other Disclosures.** We may otherwise disclose Personal Information as permitted or required by law, when we believe in good faith it is necessary for safety purposes, required for legal reporting, or to protect our legal rights or enforce our Terms of Use or any contest rules, or to protect the rights of others. We may also disclose Personal Information to our auditors, legal advisors, or to respond to a subpoena. We may also aggregate information that we gather about you, online sales, traffic patterns, and services, and provide these statistics to others in aggregate form.

**What kinds of security measures do we maintain to protect Personal Information?**

We maintain reasonable technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect Personal Information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. For example, the areas of our Sites that enable or require you to submit payment information online use encryption to protect such information. We also review our security procedures periodically to consider appropriate new technology and updated methods, although you should note that no security measures are ever perfect or impenetrable. 

**How can you access, update, or block your Personal Information?**

We generally collect Personal Information voluntarily given to us by our visitors. You can contact us directly any time at the address below to update your Personal Information. You can also log-in to your FedEx Cross Border account, and use our online account resources to access your Personal Information or submit any updates or corrections to your contact information.
