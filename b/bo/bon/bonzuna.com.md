**Sharing and Disclosure of Information**  
Bonzuna does not rent, sell, or share any information about the user with any third-parties. Bonzuna may disclose your Personal Information if Bonzuna believes such action is necessary to: (a) comply with the law or legal process served on Bonzuna (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Bonzuna (including the enforcement of our agreements); or (c) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Bonzuna services or members of the public.
