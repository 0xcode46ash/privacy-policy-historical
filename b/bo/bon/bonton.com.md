**The Bon-Ton's Privacy Policy**  
We understand your concerns about privacy and have instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner.

This Privacy Policy includes examples of the types of personal information we collect. We do not sell or rent the information you provide to us. We do, however, share your information with third parties under certain circumstances. We use this information for marketing and promotional purposes and to service your account. The examples provided below are illustrative and should not be considered a complete inventory of our information collection, use and sharing practices.

**Information We May Collect**  
_The Bon-Ton may collect personal information about you from the following sources:_  
Information we receive from you (or is provided to us on your behalf) on applications, contest entry forms, survey responses and other forms you submit to us, such as your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, social security number and income; Information about your transactions with The Bon-Ton or others, such as your purchasing preferences; and Information from consumer reporting agencies, providers of marketing and demographic information and data collection agencies, such as customer names and mailing addresses and information about your credit worthiness. 

**Information We May Disclose and To Whom We May Disclose Information**  
_Disclosures Permitted by Law_  
The Bon-Ton may disclose your personal information without your consent as permitted by law. For example, we may use nonaffiliated parties to perform services for us, such as providing customer assistance and customer billing, and we may disclose your personal information to consumer reporting agencies. We also may disclose information in response to requests from law enforcement agencies or in response to a subpoena or court order.

_Other Disclosures_  
We may disclose the personal information we collect to companies that perform marketing services on our behalf or to companies which offer products or services you may find of value or to other financial institutions, such as insurers, with whom we have marketing agreements.

**Information Regarding Former Customers**  
The Bon-Ton does not disclose personal information about former customers or customers with inactive accounts, except in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

**Our Security Procedures**  
The Bon-Ton restricts access to personal information about you to those employees whom we determine have a legitimate business purpose to access such information in connection with the provision of products or services to you. We employ security techniques designed to protect our customer data. We provide training and communications programs designed to educate employees about the meaning and requirements of our strict standards for data security and confidentiality.

**Cookies**  
Cookies are identifiers we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and provide features to you. The "help" portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether. However, cookies allow you to take full advantage of our features, and we recommend that you leave them turned on.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
We reserve the right to modify or supplement this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes, we will provide current customers with a revised notice that describes our new practices.

**Your Preference**  
If you prefer that we do not disclose your personal information to nonaffiliated third parties, you may opt out of those disclosures, that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law).
