# Bond Bank: Privacy Policy

| 

Bond Bank and its affiliates are deeply committed to protecting the privacy of Internet users. Below is information outlining our continued support for the responsible management of customer's information. 

**Customer Information**

During the process of delivering this service to you, we may collect personal identifiable information about you such as name, address, phone number, and e-mail address. We may also obtain some types of non-personally identifiable information such as the Internet Service Provider you use to connect to the Internet, your browser type, or the type of computer operating system you use (e.g. Macintosh or Windows). The information collected by Bond Bank is used for the purpose of targeting information to users and measuring the effectiveness of the service. 

In some cases, you may voluntarily provide personal information in response to a specific advertisement (these advertisements may ask you to fill out a survey form or provide your postcode). If this does occur, Bond Bank may collect this information on behalf of an advertiser. This information is used by an advertiser to respond to your request. In addition, Bond Bank may combine this with information from other users, and review it in an aggregate form to understand the type of individuals who view a specific type of advertisement or visit a particular kind of website. 

**Mailing Lists**

Bond Bank manages an email newsletter network, delivering advertisements into permission-based email programs. Sometimes, we will ask you to provide your email address, so that we can send you whatever information you request for. In addition, you may provide Bond Bank with additional information, including your gender, age, zip code, interest categories, or other non-personally identifiable information. 

If you are participating in a newsletter program that is being managed and hosted by Bond Bank, the email address that you provide to us will only be used by Bond Bank to send information, which you have specifically told us you are interested in receiving. 

If you have provided additional information such as gender, age, postcode, zip code, or other non-personally-identifiable information, Bond Bank may use this information to provide you more relevant advertisements within the newsletters you have requested for, and to measure our effectiveness on behalf of our advertisers as described in the previous paragraphs. 

**Cookies**

Bond Bank, as well as most sites on the Internet, uses "cookies" to enhance your experience on the web. Bond Bank cannot use these cookies to personally identify you in any way. 

What are cookies and why do we use them? A cookie is a unique number that is provided to you the first time Bond Bank serves you an advertisement. This unique number, which is stored in a cookie file on your computer, helps Bond Bank target advertisements to you. The cookies also help Bond Bank to ensure that we do not serve you the same advertisement(s) multiple times, and help our advertisers understand what you like and do not like about their offerings so that they can cater better for your needs the next time you are interested in their products or services. While we believe that cookies enhance your Internet experience by limiting the number of times you see the same advertisement and delivering more relevant content to you, they are not required for Bond Bank to deliver you an advertisement. 

Bond Bank also uses anonymous identifiers ("cookies") to collect anonymous preference and interest information. This information is provided and used to create anonymous interest profiles on individual browsers. This information does not include any personally identifiable data (such as name, address or e-mail address) that is considered sensitive, controversial, or would compromise a customer's privacy. Profiles are accessed by Bond Bank, its advertisers and affiliates to tailor site content, promotions and advertising, and to perform market research 

If you do not want the benefit of cookies, there is a simple procedure to manually delete your cookies. Please consult your web browser's Help documentation for more information. 

For further enquiries about these and any other issues, please contact The [Webmaster](mailto:webmaster@bondbankng.com).
