### Boogie Jack's Web Depot Privacy Policy

**The Short Version**

At Boogie Jack's Web Depot your privacy is respected. If you write for any reason, you are not tracked or added to any mailing list database by this web site. I do have opt-in mailing lists. If you subscribe to any of my lists, your mailing address is not shared in any way with 3rd parties. It will never be sold, traded or given to anyone. I don't like spam and I don't participate in it. Nor do I use cookies to gather personal information about you. Generic information such as browser type, screen resolution, and other non-personally identifiable information is collected. This helps me optimize the design of my site for the majority of my visitors. 

Boogie Jack's Web Depot is a vertical partner with About.com. About.com serves advertising to this site, and is a member of the TRUSTe program. TRUSTe is an independent, non-profit initiative whose mission is to build users' trust and confidence in the Internet by promoting TRUSTe's principles of fair information practices. 

You can review About.com's detailed privacy policy [here](http://about.com/gi/pages/privacy.htm?PM=59_1106_T). 

**The Long Version**

I've created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate my firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses my information gathering and dissemination practices for Boogie Jack's Web Depot. 

  * This site contains links to other sites. Boogie Jack's Web Depot is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of other web sites. 

  * My site uses a secure order form for customers to request products and services. I collect visitor's contact information (like their email address) and financial information (credit card numbers). Contact information from the order form is used to send orders to my customers. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the purchaser for products and services. No information about the purchaser is stored in permanent databases on the server. All orders are made through a 128 bit secure server, and all orders receive approval from Visa/MasterCard before products or services are rendered. 

  * Your IP address is used to help identify you and your shopping cart if you purchase anything, and to prevent criminals from perpetuating credit card fraud on you or me. 

  * Occasionally, online surveys ask visitors for demographic information (like age, income level). Specific information is not shared in any way with 3rd parties. General information (like 65% of respondants purchase online, are female, or whatever) may be shared with potential advertisers to help them decide if my audience is right for their ad campaign. Again, specific information such as names, email addresses, etc, ARE NEVER SHARED. 

  * I run contests on my site where visitors are asked for contact information (like their email address). The customer's contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary, such as to notify the winner that they've won. 

  * I use an outside company to display ads on my site. This enables me to pay my bills and offer so much free stuff. Ads may or may not contain cookies, and appear to be coming from my site, but in reality they are coming from my vertical partner, About.com. About.com is a member of the TRUSTe program. You may view their very detailed privacy policy [here](http://about.com/gi/pages/privacy.htm?PM=59_1106_T). I do not have access to any information about you from cookies you may or may not receive while here. 

  * This site makes use of public forums such as a chatroom. Please remember that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your personal information. 

  * This site does NOT intentionally collect contact information from children, however, children do have access to contest forms, surveys, and email links in which they may submit information without parental consent or parental knowledge. Such information, if received, will only be used to respond directly to the child's request and is never used for other purposes nor shared with any 3rd parties for any reason. 

  * If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this Web site, you can contact:
