This Privacy Policy discloses our privacy practices and expresses our commitment to keeping you informed of the information we collect and how it is used. We ask that you take time to read it carefully. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect new uses, rules, regulations or technologies that impact your privacy. We recommend that users review our Privacy Policy on a routine basis to view any changes. This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies and business practices. This Privacy Policy applies to this site and governs data collection and usage at this site. Please read it in its entirety. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH OUR PRIVACY POLICY, THEN DO NOT USE THIS SITE.

This privacy statement discloses the privacy practices for [www.books24x7.com](http://www.books24x7.com/).

2\. TYPES OF INFORMATION COLLECTED AND HOW IT IS USED; SHARING OF INFORMATION

Books24x7 uses cookies to maintain user sessions with the site. Cookies allow us to both store and retrieve login and session information through a user's browser. This allows us to measure and report individual session information to employers of corporate subscriptions, such as number of active minutes and number of sessions, and at the corporation's discretion, additional individual information such as a list of titles read. Designated subscription administrators have online access to information about other users registered in the subscription, including first name, last name, email address and username. We also use non-personally identifiable information aggregated across our user base for marketing purposes and to provide publishing partners with information about their books, such as number of times a title has been viewed, most frequently viewed titles, etc. Users cannot use Books24x7.com unless they accept cookies.

We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, and to administer our web site. Your IP address is used to gather broad demographic information. We track user activity on the site, such as last login, session failures, search queries and number of results, and other non-personally identifiable information in order, among other things, to help us manage and improve our site. We may use such non-personally identifiable information, among other things, to analyze trends, promote and market our site, products and/or services, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic and other non-personally identifiable information for aggregate use at our site or otherwise. We may also share non-personally identifiable information with third parties, including, without limitation, our business partners, vendors, distributors, advertisers and marketers.

Sometimes, such as when you register for a service, order a product, or make other inquiries, we will ask for specific information about you in order to provide that product or service to you. We may need certain personally identifiable information such as contact and billing information, including name, company name, e-mail address, work and home telephone numbers, fax number and a physical postal address. Books24x7 values opinions and comments from users and, therefore, we frequently conduct online surveys Information collected by Books24x7 in such surveys may include personally identifiable information. As part of the evaluation process of the Books 24x7 subscription services, we conduct online surveys during the pilot program, requesting participants to respond. Additionally, we frequently conduct online surveys to obtain opinions and comments from users on product features and direction ("General Survey"). Participation in the General Survey is optional to the users. In general, we will only use personally identifiable information for the purpose for which such information was provided to us. We may also use personally identifiable information to inform users of updates to Books24x7.com (such as New Book alerts that we send out weekly to advise of new titles added to the service), to send users information about our company and services, or promotional material from some of our business partners, or to contact users when necessary. We may also use personally identifiable information to contact users who participated in an online survey to contact them with regards to responses provided by them in the survey. Users may opt-out of receiving future communications from Books24x7 by following the instructions set forth below in Section 8, Choice/Opt-out. Financial information that is collected is used to bill the user for products and services. We may also use the company name as part of our standard customer reference list.

With respect to information collected from online surveys, and in the event that responses are to be publicly disclosed, users will be notified at the time they take the survey and Books24x7 will disclose only aggregate information regarding its users and not personal information identifying any specific user. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in cases where surveys allow users to submit written comments and/or other textual responses, and where Books24x7 advises users of the possibility of such disclosure at the time they take the survey, Books24x7 reserves the right to use, reproduce, publish, display or disclose any textual responses provided by a user through such a survey, provided that no personally identifiable information of that user is disclosed, unless such user grants Books24x7 permission to do so.

Books24x7 may need to share the personally identifiable information you provide online with outside contractors who may be used to ship products, provide technical support, handle order processing, or otherwise act on Books24x7's behalf for the purpose of providing products and services. Books24x7 works with a credit card processor, passing encrypted credit card information to them for payment processing, and thus personal identifiable information is shared with the credit card processor.

We have established relationships with distributors who sell subscriptions to Books24x7.com. We share aggregate non-personally identifiable information with these distributors and we provide them with access to users' personally identifiable information only for those customers to which they sell subscriptions.

Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we will keep your personally identifiable information private and will not share it with third parties, unless such disclosure is necessary to: (a) comply with legal process (such as a court order) or other legal requirements of any governmental authority; (b) protect our rights or property; (c) enforce our Membership Agreement located at <http://www.books24x7.com/mhelp.asp?item=membership> and incorporated herein by reference; (d) protect the interest of users of the site, other than you, or any other person; (e) protect the interests of Books24x7.com's content providers; or (f) operate or conduct maintenance and repair of our services or equipment, as authorized by law.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may transfer, sell or assign information concerning your use of this site, including without limitation, personally identifiable information, to third parties, as a result of the sale, merger, consolidation, change in control, transfer of substantial assets, reorganization or liquidation of the Books24x7.
