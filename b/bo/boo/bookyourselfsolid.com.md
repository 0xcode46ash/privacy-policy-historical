# Privacy Policy | Book Yourself Solid

Revised October 15, 2009

Michael Port & Associates LLC has created this privacy policy in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our guests. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com, and any other website under which we conduct business.

**YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS / MODIFICATIONS**  
By using this website, you indicate your acceptance of all terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this policy, please do not use our websites. Your continued use of any Michael Port & Associates LLC website following the posting of changes to these terms indicates your acceptance of those changes.

**A Special Note about Children**  
Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our services, and we ask that such persons not submit personal information to us. We believe that is important that parents supervise their children when they are online. As a result, we ask that children under the age of 18 use this service only in conjunction with parents or guardians.

**USE OF IP ADDRESSES**  
An IP address is a number which is assigned to your computer when you are online. Web servers identify your computer by its IP address. MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com may collect IP addresses for the purposes of system administration, to report aggregate information to our advertisers, and to audit the use of our site. When our guests request pages from MichaelPort.com websites, our servers log the guests’ IP addresses. We do not normally link IP addresses to anything personally identifiable, which means that a user’s session will be logged, but the user remains anonymous to BookYourselfSolid.com and MichaelPort.com and other users. We will use IP addresses to identify a user when we feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with our  [Terms of Use](http://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/terms-of-use/) or to protect our service, site, customers, or others. Please review each service prior to use and only use those that disclose information which you are willing to disclose.

**USE OF COOKIES**  
Cookies are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make browsing the Internet easier for you by saving your preferences while you access a website. MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com never saves passwords in cookies. By showing how and when users use a website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com web content are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users’ needs. MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com uses cookies primarily in two ways. First, we use them to specify unique preferences so that you do not have to tell us repeatedly about the content you are interested in. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns, so we can improve areas of the MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com online experience that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to MichaelPort.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that some parts of the MichaelPort.com service may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, you may have difficulty entering contests, or playing games. You may occasionally get cookies directly from our advertisers. MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com does not control these cookies.

**Other Information We Collect and Our Use and Disclosure of Your Information**  
Our website’s registration or purchase forms may require you to create a password and provide certain contact information (including your name and email address). Information about your gender, address, zip code, phone number and income is optional. The customer’s contact information is used to contact the visitor when necessary in the day to day running of the website. Additional information may be collected in connection with certain games, promotions, sweepstakes and contests.

We also occasionally send emails and newsletters to our users, announcing special promotions changes in our services, and other information we believe will be of interest to our users. Users may opt-out of receiving future mailings; see the choice/opt-out section below. Demographic and profile data is also collected at our site.

If you send us personal correspondence, such as emails or letters, or if other users or third parties send us correspondence about your activities or postings on our site, we may collect such information into a file specific to you. We would use information in the file that we maintain for you, and other information that we obtain from your use of the services, to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems and enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/web/20120513070420id_/http://www.bookyourselfsolid.com/terms-of-use/).

None of the information you provide will be shared with any third parties outside of Michael Port’s organization, and your information will never be used to solicit your purchase of third party goods or services.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose any information about you to law enforcement or other government officials as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose us to legal liability.

**Linked Sites**  
For your convenience, this website contains links to other websites. MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Users should be aware that when they are on MichaelPort.com or BookYourselfSolid.com, they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, doing so may direct you off of MichaelPort.com or BookYourselfSolid.com. Such other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Whenever you give out personal information online (for example, via message boards or chat rooms) information can be collected and used by other people. While MichaelPort.com and BookYourselfSolid.com strive to protect our users’ personal information and privacy, we cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online, and you do so at your own risk.

**Security**  
This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. All user information is stored on a server operated by a third party, using standard security measures. Notwithstanding these efforts, we caution you that “perfect security” does not exist on the Internet and therefore you share information at your own risk.

**Choice/Opt-Out**  
This website gives users the following options for removing their information from our database to not receive future communications or to no longer receive our service. To keep you in control of your personal information and the communications directed to you, we allow you to opt out of the following services: receiving communications (including our newsletters) from us about new Michael Port and Book Yourself Solid programs and events.
