  * Information you provide us: When setting up a Bookenda account or signing up with Bookenda.com or for a promotion requiring registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and password). For some services, such as our advertising programs, we also request information regarding your credit card or any other payment method, which we then store in an encrypted format on secure servers.
  * Cookies: When you visit Bookenda, we send one or more cookies (small files containing a string of characters) to your computer or other device to uniquely identify your browser. We use these cookies to improve the quality of our services, including storing user preferences, improving search results and ad selection and tracking browsing habits, such as how people search.

  * Links: Bookenda reserves the right to present links in a format that enables us to keep track of whether these links have been followed. We use this information to improve the quality of our search technology and the relevance of content and customized advertising.
  * Other sites: This Privacy Policy applies to Bookenda services only. We do not exercise control over the sites displayed in search results generated by Bookenda applications, products or services or in links from within our various services.

### Transmission of personal information

When you sign up for a Bookenda service, we ask you to provide personal information. If we are to use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will first ask for your consent.Unless you give prior consent, Bookenda will not collect or use any confidential information for purposes other than those set out in this Privacy Policy.

Bookenda does not communicate your personal information to individual or corporate third parties except in the following rare situations: 

  * We obtained your consent. We always ask for your permission before communicating any personal or confidential information about you to a third party.
  * We provide such information to our subsidiaries, affiliated companies or other trusted businesses or persons for the purpose of processing it on our behalf. We require that these parties agree to process such information solely according to our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Policy and that they undertake to implement appropriate data security and confidentiality protection measures.
  * We believe in good faith that access, use, protection and disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary, in the full measure allowed or required by law, in order (a) to comply with a legal, regulatory or judicial obligation or any other request issued from a public authority; (b) to enforce the applicable Terms of Use, including detecting potential infringement thereof; (c) to detect, prevent or deal with fraudulent activities, security breaches or any technical problems; or (d) to protect ourselves against any harm to the rights, property or security of Bookenda, its users or the public.

### Information security

We do our utmost to make Bookenda a safe environment for users.

Bookenda takes appropriate security measures to prevent any unauthorized access to or modification, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal audits on data collection, storage and processing, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to our personal data storage systems.

These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and judicial proceedings, if they fail to meet any of these obligations.

Before processing such requests, we ask individual users to identify themselves and indicate the information they wish to access, correct or delete. We reserve the right to decline requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate. technical effort, compromise the confidentiality of third-party information, or are difficult to comply with (for instance, requests concerning information stored on backup tapes), or for which access is not justified. Where applicable, accessing and correcting data is a free service, except where doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services specify different procedures for accessing, correcting or deleting users’ personal data.

When you make a payment, you authorize us (or our payment processor) to charge the amount to the payment source you use for the transaction.

If you pay by credit or debit card we may obtain a pre-approval from the issuer of the card for the purchase amount. We will bill your card upon acceptance of Bookenda’s policies or shortly thereafter.

If you pay by debit card and your payment results in an overdraft or other fee from your bank, you alone are responsible for that fee.

#### Actions we may take

We may take certain actions to reduce our liability and that of users in order to make Bookenda safe for users.

We may make any inquiries that we consider necessary, either directly or through third parties, concerning your identity and creditworthiness.

We may cancel any transaction if we believe the transaction violates these Terms of Payment or the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities, or if it may incur a financial loss.

We may place a delay on a payment, limit payment sources for a transaction, limit your ability to make a payment or deactivate your account if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss.

We may contact your payment source issuer, law enforcement, or impacted third parties (including other users) and share details of any payments you make if we believe doing so may prevent financial loss or a violation of law.

We may cancel any credits transferred, assigned, or sold in violation of these Terms of Payment or the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.

If you purchase advertising, and your payment method fails or your account is past due, we may take appropriate measures to recover monies owed. You agree to pay all expenses associated with such collection, including reasonable legal expenses. Interest will accrue on any past due amounts at the rate of the lesser of 1% per month or the lawful maximum.

#### Disputes and reversals

If you believe that an unauthorized or otherwise problematic transaction has taken place under your account, you agree to notify us immediately so that we may take action to prevent financial loss.

To the extent permitted by law, you waive all claims against us related to payments if more than 30 days have passed since you were charged.

You are responsible for and agree to reimburse us for all reversals, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other disbursement incurred by us (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted.

Your only remedy for a technical failure or service interruption is to request that your transaction be completed at a later time.

#### Special provisions applicable to advertisers

When you purchase advertising through Bookenda, you agree to pay all amounts specified in the order, including any applicable taxes.

You are responsible for keeping your account secure, and you understand that you will be charged for any orders placed through your account.

You can cancel an advertising order at any time through our online portal, but your ads may run for several days thereafter, and you will still be required to pay for these ads.

Without limiting the previous section, your order constitutes your written authorization for us to obtain your personal and/or business credit report. We may obtain your credit report when you place an order, or at any time thereafter.

You will pay any taxes that apply to your transactions. You agree to indemnify us against any claim arising out of your failure to do so.
