### Pricing Policy

All prices are listed in Australian dollars and are inclusive of GST. If placing an order from outside Australia you will be charged in your own currency at the conversion rate of your credit card company.

All prices on the Booktopia website are for orders placed via the website only. Orders placed by phone, fax (only for orders not with a Booktopia order number), in person at our office or by mail order will be charged the full RRP prices quoted on the website plus a $10 non-refundable administration fee as they will need to be hand processed by Booktopia staff.

All orders are subject to price and availability confirmation. If we cannot supply the product for the originally advertised price then Booktopia will do one of two things.

If the increase in price is marginal then Booktopia will absorb the increase and proceed with the order and adjust the price on the website after processing your order.

If the price is significantly more then we will not proceed until we have consulted with the customer via the message centre in your Booktopia account and outlined the options. The customer will not be charged for that item until Booktopia has been given confirmation to proceed with the new price. You have 48 hours to respond to the options given to you. If you respond after this time frame, you will be asked to place a new order through the website. If there are other titles on the order that are readily available then they will be automatically ordered, regardless of what percentage of the order they make up.

Booktopia are not obligated to sell a title at the listed price if we are not able to source it from our supplier at the time of ordering as prices may have changed in the interim. In all instances you will be contacted via the message centre in your Booktopia account if there is a change of price and Booktopia will endeavour to find an alternative edition for the same price or discuss the possibility of purchasing the same title at the new price.

We reserve the right to correct any printing errors.

### Cover Images

The images on our website are intended as a guide only. As Booktopia does not keep every title in stock on site we are unable to guarantee the cover image that arrives from the supplier, will be that listed on the site. Publishers can have various cover designs for one ISBN so images can change without notification.

### Secure Shopping

Booktopia encrypts all personal information submitted to our server via industry-standard SSL.

### Returns Policy

We understand that from time-to-time you may need to return an item to us.

**Before returning any items please contact Booktopia Customer Service Team to discuss your reason for requiring a return and organise an approval to return an item to Booktopia.**

  1. Booktopia will not pay for postage if you are returning an item because you have changed your mind, or made a mistake in your ordering.

The Booktopia Distribution Centre address is: Unit E1, 3-29 Birnie Avenue, Lidcombe, NSW 2141. To qualify for a credit an item must be returned in perfect condition ready to be resold. Failure to package a returning item properly will undoubtedly result in no store credit and the product will be returned to the customer.
  6. A store credit issued for a return will be for the value of the returned item only. A store credit for a specific item does not cover the cost of postage.
