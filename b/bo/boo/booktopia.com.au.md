Globalise Pty Ltd Privacy Policy

## Privacy policy

Globalise Pty Ltd ("Globalise") is committed to protecting your online privacy while providing you with the most useful and enjoyable Web experience possible. While you can use many features of Globalise websites anonymously, you may be required to provide personal information to gain access to some of our content and services, particularly our products KUIconnect! and KUIcontact!   
This privacy policy covers information regarding accessing our websites, as well as usage of Globalise's products. 

### How we collect and use personal information

When required, registering for membership on www.globalise.com.au and subscribing to usage of our products gives you access to information and features. Information required may be your name, e-mail address, country, and ZIP/postal code. With your approval, we occasionally will send e-mail to notify you about important changes to the site, new services, and special offers from us. If you would rather not receive these e-mail notifications, you can simply indicate that preference to us by email or other. We do not use your personal information outside of our business in any way - either with Partners or Third Parties. We do use your information for statistical analysis purposes to assist us with our marketing and service levels, and product support. Information collected during registration and usage of Globalise' products is stored on secure servers and is protected as below. 

### Protecting KUIconnect! and KUIcontact! information

  
Information you provide to us when ordering products are kept confidential and secure as per this policy. All operator and customer session information, including conversation transcripts, are protected and secured. All session and transcript information is made available in a secure fashion to the purchaser (being the individual or company that is the registered user of the product), and remains the property of the purchaser. 

### How we protect your personal information

All personal data you enter on www.globalise.com.au and into our products is stored securely. We have firewall and intrusion detection mechanisms in place to minimize the impact of attack. In addition to using the most secure technology available, we work tirelessly to make sure that we use any information you provide us only in ways you have approved. We send you only the e-mail you have approved in your account information or on your subscription sign-up page.   


### How we use "cookies"

As you probably know, "cookies" are small pieces of information that some Web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them. Like many other Web sites, www.globalise.com.au uses cookies to identify visitors. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies but allow you to modify security settings so you can approve or reject cookies on a case-by-case basis. Even if you do not use cookies, you can still access all of the features on our site by logging in manually with each visit. 

### What we provide to third parties

While www.globalise.com.au does not provide any third-party access to your personal information except to facilitate your own attempts to register with our partners or receive offers from select partners as mentioned elsewhere in this policy, we may provide third parties with aggregate statistics about our customers, traffic patterns, and related site information. This data reflects site usage patterns gathered during customer visits to our Web site each month, but it does not contain behavioral or identifying information about any individual member unless that member has given us permission to share that information. 

### Obtaining your consent

By using our Web site, you give Globalise permission to collect information about the pages served to you as an anonymous user for the purpose of calculating aggregate site statistics. If you register at www.globalise.com.au, you authorize Globalise to use information you provide to personalize the information we deliver to you and to use your demographic information when calculating aggregate customer data. As a registered member, you give Globalise and our agents permission to send you e-mails related to the subscription e-mail services to which you subscribe. If you are under the age of 18, you must not provide your name, e-mail address, or any other identifying information without the consent of your parent or guardian, or as otherwise provided for by applicable law. Any changes to our privacy policy will be posted on this page so that you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it.
