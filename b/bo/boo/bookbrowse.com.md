# BookBrowse.com's privacy statement

   Privacy Statement  
  
BookBrowse.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this website. 

**Personal Information**   
BookBrowse.com does not collect any personal information about a visitor unless that visitor specifically provides us an email address. 

The email addresses of those subscribing to BookBrowse's monthly magazine are added to the magazine mailing list stored in a secure location at our email host, Constant Contact. 

Email addresses collected when people enter BookBrowse giveaways, quizzes or take part in our annual consumer survey 'thank you giveaway', are used only to select the winning names and are deleted once the winners have claimed their prizes. 

Membership information is stored on a secure server. 

_**We have never, and will never sell, give-away or rent email addresses, or any other personal information**_ without your advance permission or unless ordered by a court of law. 

**Tell-A-Friend Tool**   
Visitors often wish to tell a friend about a particular page at BookBrowse, or send themselves a reminder. For this reason, like many other websites, BookBrowse provides a convenient 'tell-a-friend' tool that allows you to send a personal message to a friend telling them about BookBrowse. 

Email addresses are used only to send this one-time message, and are not stored or recorded by BookBrowse in anyway. 

It is possible that a misguided person might abuse this 'tell-a-friend' tool to send a message to somebody who is not their friend and who does not want to get email from them. This is an unlikely situation, but if you have received such an email, we apologize for it. 

**Information Automatically Logged**   
We collect IP (internet protocol) addresses to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. IP addresses are also used to gather broad demographic information such as the percentage of visitors by country. 

Because IP addresses are usually shared by many people, BookBrowse (like the majority of websites) uses a 'cookie' in order to know how many individuals come to the site. When you visit us, BookBrowse's server sends a tiny file to your computer containing a sequence of numbers. This is stored on your hard disk in a special folder for cookies. 

If you visit BookBrowse again, your computer will check its files to see if a cookie matches, and if so send this little file back to BookBrowse, so that you are recognized as a returning visitor. This helps us calculate how many people visit in total and when they visit, but it _does not_ give us any personal information about you at all. 

This is what the contents of a typical cookie file looks like:   
CFID 212442 bookbrowse.com/   
1536 3546759168 29693834

**Information Provided by Third Parties**   
BookBrowse contains a considerable amount of information provided by 3rd parties, including, but not limited to, advertising, excerpts, reviews, interviews, book summaries and text links. As such, content at BookBrowse.com does not necessarily represent the views of the owners of BookBrowse.com and is not endorsed by BookBrowse.com. 

_Third Party Links_

This site contains links to other sites, including but not limited to, banner advertising and text links. BookBrowse.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any third party sites, and a link to a third party site should not be seen as an endorsement by BookBrowse of that site. 

_Advertising_

From time to time we use third-party advertising companies to serve ads on our Web site. These companies use cookies to track your visits to this and other websites in order to provide advertisements that may be of interest to you. The information about you does not include personal details such as your name or address, it is simply a cookie (as explained in the previous section) that tracks general traffic movements. If you would like more information about this practice, or you would like to opt out from having your data collected by some advertising networks, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp "opt out of ads"). 

**Contacting BookBrowse.com**   
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this website, please [contact us](http://www.bookbrowse.com/contactus "contact us").
