# Privacy Statement for BookBrowse

  
**Privacy Statement for BookBrowse.com  **

BookBrowse.com has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses the information gathering and dissemination practices for this Web site: BookBrowse.com 

**Information Automatically Logged    
**  
We use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our Web site. Your IP address is also used to gather broad demographic information such as your likely country of origin.  This information may be shared with third parties such as advertisers.

**Personal Information    
**  
BookBrowse.com does not use cookies to collect information.  
The following lists instances where this web site collects information that personally identifies you or allows you to be personally contacted:

**Entering a Book Draw  
**Your email address is necessary in order to enter any book draw at BookBrowse.com - for the simple reason that without your email address we could not notify you if you won!  Once the book draw is closed and the winner chosen all email addresses are erased - unless you have chosen to subscribe to an ezine (see below).

**Subscribing to BookBrowse Updates:**   If you choose to subscribe to the weekly ezine of BookBrowse.com (by completing the subscribe form or checking the box on the book draw entry form) your email address will  be added to our mailing list.  However, we store no other personal information and absolutely guarantee that we will not make available any part of this mailing list to any third party.  We will also make reasonable efforts to protect this list from theft by hackers. 

**Opting to have your name added to an external mailing list  
**Sometimes, when entering a book draw, you will have the opportunity to subscribe to a related newsletter (for example an email newsletter about the author of the book that you are entering to win).  These email newsletters are provided by third parties and therefore  your email address will be made available to that third party, under the condition that the given third party use the information solely for the purpose stated and do not make the list available to any other third party.

**Completing an Online Survey  
**In an effort to improve BookBrowse.com, from time to time we run online surveys to collect demographic, usage and satisfaction data.   This maybe made available to third parties.   You can choose whether or not to complete the survey and whether or not to provide your email address.    
All email addresses are collected and stored in a totally separate file from the stats (so data cannot be associated with any individual email addresses).  These email addresses are used for the sole purpose of choosing the winners (if prizes are offered), or when a reply has been requested - i.e. when a question has been asked by the person answering the survey questions.  Once the survey is complete these email addresses are deleted.
