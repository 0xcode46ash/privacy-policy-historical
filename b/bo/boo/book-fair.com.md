# Frankfurt Book Fair - Privacy Policy / Terms & Conditions

**1 - General information on data protection**

Visitors to the Frankfurt Book Fair Internet portal can access a lot of the information provided without registering. On subsequent pages, however, it is often necessary for you to enter company-related or personal data, so that we can offer the desired services or send you the required information. Whenever there is a request for entering personal or company-related data (e.g. name, address, e-mail address) the disclosure of this information is on a voluntary basis.

We are obligated to ensure that the data you have provided is given sufficient protection within our systems in accordance with the applicable laws. We believe you should be able to rely on your data being handled in a responsible and confidential way. Our data-protection concept also incorporates contractors who might need your data to carry out an order to your complete satisfaction. It is not our aim to use or pass on personal data without permission and for purposes other than those stated at the time the data was collected.

During all transactions, where you are logged in as a registered user, we use cookies in order to optimise the communication times and to undertake anonymous statistical analysis of the utilisation of our website. No provision is made for the creation of personal user profiles. If you do not wish cookies to be used, you can prevent this by adjusting your browser settings. In that case the process of user registration and the use of the protected area of the website can not be offered.

Some of our web sites have links to the Internet sites of other companies and organisations. In view of the fact that we have no responsibility for these sites, we recommend that you read the information about data protection at these sites in detail.

If you have any questions or comments on our security concept or if you want your personal data to be blocked or deleted, please contact us by using the following e-mail address: privacy@book-fair.com.
