Privacy Policy

Boomerang provides business email marketing and fax communication services. Privacy is a fundamental consideration in our interaction with clients and visitors to our web site. This section explains our information gathering and dissemination practices.

**Blast Wizard/Blast Manager**  
The Boomerang web site includes a link to a web-based, self-service system called Blast Wizard or Blast Manager. This part of the site is restricted to Boomerang's clients and is not available to the general public. In order to access Blast Wizard or Blast Manager, we require a client to correctly enter a user name and password. We use a cookie on the client's system to verify their identity and permit access. This is the only use we make of the cookie.

At our web site, we offer visitors the opportunity to fill out an online form in order to receive more information about the company and its services, or to sign up to receive our newsletter. We collect contact information, such as name and email address, in order to provide these services. Boomerang is the sole owner of the information collected at our site. This data will be not shared with, or sold to third parties.

**Surveys**  
Periodically, we may request contact and/or demographic information from site visitors via surveys. These surveys are completely voluntary and the visitor always has the option to decline. Any data collected will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our web site or specific Boomerang services.

**Site Data**  
Boomerang uses IP address data for site administration purposes, troubleshooting, and to assess visitor traffic patterns and the effectiveness of our site navigation. We capture this data using standard traffic analysis software and do not link this data to personal information about our visitors. We may retain this data for up to one year.

**Security**  
In providing services to our clients transacting business with their customers and prospects, we may take orders from them at our web site on behalf of our clients.
