# boomerang.com | about | policies

Boomerang is committed to a permission-based ethic in providing our e-mail and fax services. Simply put, we don't tolerate spamming. We expect our clients to use mailing lists based on existing business relationships or an opt-in process, and we offer services to help them build and maintain their lists.

Our Acceptable Use Policy in this section specifies the guidelines we follow in working with our clients. Our Privacy Policy describes how we interact with clients and visitors at our web site.  


**Acceptable Use Policy**

Boomerang.com provides services that are intended to enhance business communication between our clients and their customers, prospects and business partners. As such, we expect our clients to use appropriate e-mail and fax mailing lists, and to follow good business practices in keeping with that intent.

The client is solely responsible for the content and the lists used in these transmissions.

_**Our Guidelines**_  
When sending faxes or e-mails to existing customers and prospects, we strongly recommend the use of permission-based, or opt-in lists. This approach is being widely adopted today and serves to enhance the value of the communication. We offer services that allow a company to build an opt-in list for both e-mail and fax services, as well as to supplement and maintain existing lists. 

For every fax or e-mail, we require the sender to provide each recipient with the opportunity to opt-out, or choose not to receive similar communications in the future. Boomerang offers various opt-out services, including a managed reply mechanism with an opt-out acknowledgement for the recipient. Boomerang can also perform the list services needed to ensure that the recipients who opted-out do not receive similar mailings in the future.

Boomerang does not rent or sell mailing lists. We accept business from clients using third-party lists, but the client is solely responsible for these lists and their use must comply with the appropriate guidelines in this section.

We expect all clients to use our services for legitimate business purposes. We will not knowingly accept orders where the content is illegal, pornographic, or indecent. We do not tolerate spam, which is defined as unsolicited commercial e-mail sent to a large number of addresses. Spamming will result in immediate service termination and we will not accept future business from the sender. 

Boomerang currently offers clients the option to store their content and address lists on our system. This is offered for convenience purposes only and is designed solely for use with the e-mail or fax services that Boomerang provides. In keeping with standard practices to safeguard data, we strongly encourage clients to keep current back-up copies of these files on their computer systems.
