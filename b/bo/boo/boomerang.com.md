Privacy Policy

Boomerang provides business email communication services. Privacy is a fundamental consideration in our interaction with clients and visitors. This section explains our information gathering and dissemination practices related to our web site at www.boomerang.com.

**Blast Wizard/Manager**  
The Boomerang site includes a link to a web-based, self-service system called Blast Wizard or Blast Manager. This part of the site is restricted to Boomerang's clients and is not available to the general public. In order to access Blast Wizard/Manager we require a client to correctly enter a user name and password. We use a cookie on the client's system to verify the client's identity and allow access to Blast Wizard/Manager. This is the only use we make of the cookie.

**More Information/Newsletter**  
At our web site, we offer visitors the opportunity to fill out an online form in order to receive more information about the company and its services, or to sign up to receive our newsletter. We collect contact information, such as name and email address, in order to provide these services. Boomerang is the sole owner of the information collected at our site. This data will be not shared with, or sold to third parties.

**Surveys**  
Periodically, we may request contact and/or demographic information from site visitors via surveys. These surveys are completely voluntary and the visitor always has the option to decline. Any data collected will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our web site or specific Boomerang services.

**Site Data**  
Boomerang uses IP address data for site administration purposes, troubleshooting, and to assess visitor traffic patterns and the effectiveness of our site navigation. We capture this data using standard traffic analysis software and do not link this data to personal information about our visitors. We may retain this data for up to one year. Other than as described above, we do not currently use cookies at our web site.

**Security**  
In providing services to our clients transacting business with their customers and prospects, we may take orders from them at our web site on behalf of our clients. To fulfill those orders, we may collect personal information about the end-users. We will share this information only with our client. The information will be treated as private and will not be disclosed to any non-affiliated third party or used for improper purposes. Except for the collection of personal information on behalf of our clients, we do not request or collect sensitive personal information at our web site.

In order to set up an account, our clients provide us with credit and billing information. This is currently done over the phone. We treat any such information as private and take appropriate precautions to protect it.

Transmission of information through our web site can be unstable, unreliable and insecure. There is a risk that information may be intercepted illegally.

**Special Offers**  
We send all new clients a letter that verifies their user name and password. Occasionally we may send special offers from Boomerang or third parties to our clients. We will always provide a way for them to opt-out of similar mailings in the future.
