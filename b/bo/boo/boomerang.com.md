# Boomerang Privacy Policy â€“ Email Marketing Spam Compliance

Boomerang provides email marketing and fax communication services for business. Privacy is a fundamental consideration in our interaction with clients and visitors to our web site. This section explains our information gathering and retention practices.

##  BlastWizard

The Boomerang web site includes a link to a web-based, self-service system called BlastWizard. This part of the site is restricted to Boomerang's clients and is not available to the general public. In order to access BlastWizard, we require a client to enter a valid user name and password. We use a cookie on the client's system to verify their identity and permit access. This is the only use we make of a cookie on our web site.

Within BlastWizard, Boomerang's clients can upload files containing data about their own customers, including but not limited to email addresses and fax numbers. These files are used to perform permission-based email marketing and fax campaigns using the BlastWizard engine. This data is used strictly by the client, and is the sole property of that client. Boomerang does not share, rent or sell these lists or the data that comprise them.

Boomerang also requires users to enter email addresses and/or fax numbers of users who will be receiving job confirmations, proof emails and results emails.

Per FCC regulations regarding the transmission of commercial faxes, Boomerang requires that users sending faxes enter a valid sending company name, phone number and fax number to be included on the first page of each fax.

None of the data required on the BlastWizard site are ever shared, sold or rented.

Boomerang keeps the information that is collected in Blast Wizard indefinitely.

##  More Information/Newsletter

At our web site we offer visitors the opportunity to fill out an online form in order to receive more information about the company and its services, or to sign up to receive our newsletter. We collect contact information, such as name and email address, in order to provide these services. Boomerang is the sole owner of the information collected at our site. This data will be not shared with, or sold to third parties.

##  Surveys

Periodically, we may request contact and/or demographic information from site visitors via surveys. These surveys are completely voluntary and the visitor always has the option to decline. Any data collected will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of our web site or specific Boomerang services.

##  Web Site Traffic Analysis

Boomerang uses IP address data for site administration purposes, troubleshooting, and to assess visitor traffic patterns and the effectiveness of our web site. We capture this data using standard traffic analysis software and do not link this data to personal information about our visitors. We may retain this data for up to one year. Other than as described above, we do not currently use cookies at our web site.

##  Client and Web Site Visitor Provided Information

Boomerang may collect personally identifiable information such as name, title, business name and address, e-mail address, and telephone number, for the purpose of providing promotional services to clients and web site visitors. Such personally identifiable information is only collected if voluntarily provided by the client or web site visitor. Clients and web site visitors may change or review personally identifiable information provided to Boomerang by contacting Boomerang at [ sitevisitorinfo@boomerang.com](mailto:sitevisitorinfo@boomerang.com).

##  Security

In providing services to our clients transacting business with their customers and prospects, we may take orders from them at our web site on behalf of our clients. To fulfill those orders, we may collect personal information about the end-users. We will share this information only with our client. The information will be treated as private and will not be disclosed to any third party or used for improper purposes. Except as noted above, we do not request or collect sensitive personal information at our web site.

In order to set up an account, our clients provide us with credit and billing information. This is currently done via fax. We treat any such information as private and take appropriate precautions to protect it.

We treat all information provided to us by our clients for their mailings as confidential, including their mailing lists. We use this information only as directed by the client and do not share it with any third party.

Transmission of information through our web site can be unstable, unreliable and insecure. There is a risk that information may be intercepted illegally.

##  Special Offers

We send all new clients a letter that verifies their user name and password. Occasionally we may send special offers from Boomerang or third parties to our clients. We will always provide a way for them to opt-out of similar promotional mailings in the future.
