## Site Registration

BookingBuddy's registration form may require users to provide basic contact and demographic information. We use or may use your contact information (such as email address) from the registration form to send you newsletters and occasional information about our services and partners, inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with BookingBuddy, or investigate cases of suspected fraud or abuse. You may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. 

In the future, in order to customize your experience with our email newsletters, we may receive a confirmation when you open email from BookingBuddy if your computer supports such capabilities. Clicking on a link in a BookingBuddy newsletter may also be tracked on a per user basis to allow us to present content, which closely matches your interests. Demographic and profile data (such as state, zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site or in our email newsletters, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. _Individial user click behavior is never shared with advertisers and partners._

If, in the future, you enter BookingBuddy via a reward or incentive program, BookingBuddy may share your email address with the program through which you entered BookingBuddy to ensure you are credited with your incentive. 

You may also register for BookingBuddy and/or specific BookingBuddy newsletters at web sites operated by third parties. These third parties may share contact, demographic or profile data that you voluntarily provide during the registration process with BookingBuddy. You also may provide personal information to third parties when you register at a third party web site and specifically request that your information be forwarded to us so that we can send you information about our product and service offerings. BookingBuddy does or may in the future use this information in the same manner as information collected directly by BookingBuddy. This Privacy Policy does not bind sites that collect information on behalf of BookingBuddy, and BookingBuddy is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such web sites. 

To better serve you, we may also store information you present to us via email or telephone communications with BookingBuddy's Customer Service Department. This information is or may be used in the same manner as information directly collected using BookingBuddy's registration form. We may also use information you provide us via email or telephone to pursue the matter for which you contacted us. BookingBuddy also may obtain information from you in our online forums. This information may not be disclosed except as consistent with Terms of Use. 

In order to better communicate with registered users about their registration status, BookingBuddy may acquire information about users from third-party sources, including but not limited to a users mailing address. The information collected will only be shared, if at all, on an aggregate basis only with third parties. 

Email Communications: To help us make emails more useful and interesting, we often receive a confirmation when you open email from BookingBuddy if your computer supports such capabilities.

## Data Sharing

We will share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. 

BookingBuddy may use third parties to perform certain tasks such as package delivery. Personal information may be provided to these agents as is necessary to perform their functions. 

BookingBuddy partners with third-party companies to provide services to BookingBuddy users. When you sign up for one of these services, the information you provide in signing up for the service is shared with the third party and is protected in accordance with the third party's Privacy Policy. 

In the future, BookingBuddy may host content on behalf of certain other web site partners. These pages will be identified as they have the navigation of the partner site.

## Sweepstakes, Online Surveys, and Order Forms

BookingBuddy occasionally runs sweepstakes, hosts online surveys, or uses order forms on our web site in which we ask for contact and demographic information. Participation in sweepstakes and surveys and usage of order forms is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. We use or may use your contact information (such as email address) from your sweepstakes entry, survey registration, or order form to inform you if you are the potential winner of a contest or promotion, personalize your experience with BookingBuddy, send you newsletters (should you opt-in for these newsletters) and occasional information about our services or partners, or investigate cases of suspected fraud. You may opt-out of receiving future communications; see the Opting-Out of Further Communications section below. 

Demographic and profile data (such as zip code, age, or gender) may be used to customize your experience at our site, showing you content and advertising that may best suit your needs. This information is shared with advertisers and other third parties on an aggregate basis only. In the event that BookingBuddy partners with a third party to run a sweepstakes, BookingBuddy may share demographic and profile data with such third party only as indicated in the official sweepstakes rules. 

## Tell-a-Friend and Email This Deal

BookingBuddy may, from time to time, offer services to allow our users to send information about our site to their friends. If a user elects to use such service for informing a friend about our site, or elects to use our other services to inform a friend about information on our site, we will ask them for the friend's email address. We will automatically send the friend a one-time email inviting them to visit our site. We store this information for the purpose of sending this one-time email and investigating suspected fraud. 

## Children Under 13 Years Old

BookingBuddy and its affiliated sites do not knowingly collect, maintain or use personal information from our websites about children under age 13.
