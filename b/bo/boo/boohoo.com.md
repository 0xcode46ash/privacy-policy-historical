### boohoo.com Privacy Policy

We are committed to protecting and respecting the privacy of all visitors and users of this website. 

Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices regarding your personal data and how we will treat it. We will only use your personal information in accordance with this privacy policy and applicable current data protection laws. 

**By submitting your information and using our Website, you consent to the collection, storage and processing of your personal information by us in the manner set out in this privacy policy.**   
**You should print a copy of this privacy policy for future reference.**

**What personal information do we collect?**

If you decide to make an order with us, there is certain personal information that we will require from you in order to process your order (such as your name, delivery address, credit/debit card details, e-mail address and telephone number). 

We will only pass on your personal information to third parties if it is an essential part of trading with you (i.e. passing on you name and address to our carriers). We will not rent or sell your name, address, email address, credit card details or any other personal information to any unrelated third party. 

From time to time we may also request further information to help us improve our service to you. 

We may also ask you to complete surveys that we use for research purposes, although you do not have to respond to them. 

**IP addresses and cookies**

We also use your Internet Protocol (IP) address. An IP address is a set of numbers, which is assigned to your computer during a browsing session. It is automatically logged by our servers and used to collect traffic data about visitors to our websites. We do not use your IP address to identify you personally. 

Our site uses cookies to keep track of your visits to our website. A cookie is a small file that can be stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to save your email address and password so that you don't have to re-enter it every time you visit our site. Cookies also help us to recognise when you visit our website and note the areas that are of interest to you. This allows us to tailor the service we provide. 

Cookies do not contain confidential information such as your home address, telephone number or credit card details. We do not exchange cookies with any third party websites. 

You may refuse to accept cookies by activating the setting on your browser which allows you to refuse the setting of cookies. However, if you select this setting you may be unable to access certain parts of our site. Unless you have adjusted your browser setting so that it will refuse cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site. 

Please note that our advertisers may also use cookies, over which we have no control. 

**Site statistics**

We monitor customer traffic on an aggregate basis using cookies and code, which is embedded, in the site. This provides statistical information about visits to pages on the site, the duration of individual page view, paths taken by visitors through the site, data on visitors screen settings and other general information. Wasabi Frog Limited uses this information to help improve the site and services to its users. 

**Where we store your personal data**

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers. Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. By submitting your personal data, you agree to this transfer, storing or processing. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. 

We follow strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information to prevent unauthorised access or unlawful processing of your personal information. We keep your information confidential and store it on a secure server which is password protected and hidden behind a firewall. 

We use secure socket layer software (SSL) to encrypt all of your personal information including your credit card number and your name and address. This technology prevents you from inadvertently revealing personal information using an insecure connection. 

The Thawte Secure Site Program allows you to learn more about web sites you visit before you submit any confidential information. When you see a Thawte logo, clicking on it will verify that this web site is secure. 

No credit or debit card details are stored once your order has been processed. This is why you can save your delivery address but need to enter your card details for every transaction. 

We recommend that you always close down your internet browser when you have finished shopping online especially if you use a shared PC. This will delete temporary cookies from any sites that you may have visited. 

Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which enables you to access certain parts of our site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask you not to share a password with anyone. 

**We will never send an email or telephone you to ask for your security information or log on details.**

Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our site. Any transmission is at your own risk. You accept the inherent security risks of providing information and dealing on line over the internet. Once we have received your information, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access. We will not be held responsible for any breach of security unless this is due to our negligence or wilful default. 

**Uses made of the information**

  * set up, manage your account and contact you about your account;
  * ensure that content from our site is presented in the most effective manner for you and for your computer;
