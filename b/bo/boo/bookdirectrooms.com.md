# UK Hotels - Cheap Hotels, Bed and Breakfasts and Guest Houses in the UK at BookDirectRooms.com

Booking over the internet is actually safer in many ways than buying in a shop or restaurant. We make sure that we take approriate measures to make booking online as safe as it can be including encrypting your credit card details when they're sent to us. Our security procedures are verified by Verisign.

We are committed to ensuring that your privacy is protected and understand the need for appropriate protection of all personal information provided by you to us. This Privacy Policy has been created in order that you understand the importance that we attach to this issue and our commitment to ensure that we comply with UK legislation in this area. 

### 1\. Your Consent

By using our Website and providing personal details, including where you use the Website to search or book accomodation, you consent to the collection, use and retention of your personal information for our legitimate business purposes as explained and set out in this Privacy Policy. 

### 2\. Collection, Use & Retention of Information

We collect, use and retain information about you to the extent only that is reasonably required to conduct our business effectively. 

The information collected varies depending on the service you request from us. For example, when you use the Website to book accomodation, we may collect personal details such as your name, address, accomodation details, credit/debit card number and expiry date, billing details and telephone numbers. This information may be collected from third parties including the third party accomodation provider who you access via our Website and who you place your booking with, or other people who collect information on our behalf such as regional and local tourism agencies. We also collect information directly from you when you speak to us over the telephone or send us correspondence. Finally,we undertake market research, or have third parties undertake it on our behalf and collect information in that way. 

We use information to complete transactions on your behalf and to ensure that we can efficiently manage and track transactions that are processed through our system. Your credit/debit card details are only used to process the transaction you have requested and are not stored or used in any other way by us. We also use information to monitor our system efficiency and use, and to test and develop enhancements and changes to the way we do business. 

The information that we collect may be transferred to and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA) and may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers or contractors, to process or manage transactions using our system. 

The Website contains links to other sites including web pages of third party accomodation providers with whom you can book accomodation. Although this Privacy Policy applies to information about you that is provided to us by those third parties, we are not responsible for the privacy policies of those other sites and will not be liable for those policies. 

### 3\. Protection of Information

We maintain appropriate security standards and procedures in relation to the collection, use and retention of your information in order to prevent unauthorised access or disclosure. Should you contact us, our security procedures mean that we may request proof of identity before we are able to disclose any information to you. 

### 4\. Disclosure to Third Parties 

Information is shared with our group companies, contractors, data processing companies including operators of global distribution systems and payment clearing houses, bank and professional advisers. We share only the information necessary to deliver any supply of products and/or services by us to you or in order to ensure the successful completion of a transaction processed through our system or for related purposes. We may also disclose your information when necessary to protect against fraud or any other crime (usually by providing such information to a reputable information reporting organisation) or in the event that we sell our business then to the purchaser of that business. 

We may in addition from time to time share non-personal, non-individual information in aggregate form with third parties for business purposes, for example we may tell our business partners including regional tourism agencies and commercial distributors the number of customers in certain demographic groups who purchased accomodation using our system. This does not involve the disclosure of any personal information which can identify any particular customer in any way. 

Finally, we may disclose your personal information at any time where necessary to comply with any legal obligation or requirement. 

### 5\. Employee Access to Information

your information is disclosed to our employees, agents and representatives on "a need to know" basis and we confirm that all such persons understand the importance of client confidentiality and privacy. 

### 6\. Updating, Maintenance and Accuracy of your Information 

We do our best to ensure that all information held relating to you is kept up-to-date, accurate and complete. 

Data populated by you (including your personal details entered in any fields) is your sole responsibility and any changes to any aspect of your personal data should be updated directly by you.
