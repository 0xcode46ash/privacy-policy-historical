> ** Placing an Order:**  
> ---  
> **1.   Are you having Problems with the Shopping Cart?  Do you keep getting an ERROR message?**  
> We suggest the following:
> 
> 1.  The billing address information must match what the credit card company has on file for the card you are using, or the transaction will not work. This means you must enter the address with zip code that your Credit Card Company _sends your monthly statement to_.  If you continue to have difficulties you may want to call your credit card company’s 800-number, explain that you are shopping online and verify that they have your current billing information correct.  
> 
> 2.  Double check to make sure you have typed in the correct credit card number and [ CVV](https://secure.bootbarn.com/cart/cvv.html) number correctly with the correct expiration date.  There's a lot of numbers and we all make Type-O’s occasionally.
> 
> 3.   If you are using a foreign credit card, your card may or may not work with our system.  You may also fax in your order using our fax form.  [FAX ORDER FORM](https://web.archive.org/indexflatfile/fax.html).  
>

If you would like to pay with a money order, please call us at 1.888.440.2668 to verify item availability and to get the exact cost of the order before you mail it to us._  
> **5.   When will my Credit Card be Charged?**  
> ---  
> Your credit card is charged at the time your order is placed.   This reserves your order directly with us or allows us to ship the item directly from one of our manufacturer partners.  If for any reason we discover that your item is unavailable or has suddenly been discontinued, we will immediately notify you.  If the item is unavailable we will immediately  refund your account the full amount charged.  If an item is delayed we will give you the option to keep the charge active to reserve the item or cancel the order for a full refund.    
> **6.   How To Cancel or Change an Order?**  
> ---  
> You can call us at 1.888.440.2668 during business hours or email us at [ email](mailto:custserv@bootbarn.com?subject=NEED%20TO%20MAKE%20AN%20ORDER%20CHANGE!).  Please reference your order number and what you would like to change or cancel.  It is best to do this immediately after you place your order some partner warehouses ship VERY quickly!  
> **7.   Do you have a Printed Catalog?**  
> ---  
> No.  In order to provide you with the great prices you see at www.BootBarn.com, we have made the website our catalog.   Catalog retailers must charge higher, traditional store prices in order to meet the costs of producing a printed catalog.   This is before shipping prices.  By using the Internet, we have avoided these high costs and can in turn pass the savings on to you!   If you do not happen to have a computer at your home, **you may order via phone** with as little information as the Brand, Style # and size, along with any major credit card.  
> **9** **.   ** **Do you have gift certificates available on-line?**  
> ---  
> Yes.  BootBarn.com does now offer gift certificates that are _only redeemable online_.  We do not currently offer coupons or gift certificates for online purchase for our stores locations.  And, our online gift certificates are only redeemable for online orders.  
> 
> Our gift certificates will be mailed to the person of your choice.

> **Prices on the Internet versus our Store Pricing?**  
> ---  
>   
>   
>  BootBarn.com prices sometimes **_do differ_** from pricing in our retail stores
> 
> Yes, our Internet prices are occasionally different from the prices in our stores.  Generally this is the case for three primary reasons:
> 
> 1) The lower cost usually helps make up for the shipping costs involved on Internet ordering.  Shipping costs can range from $7.95 up to $19.95 for a single item shipped with the contiguous U.S. 
> 
> 2) Our operating costs are lower online, thus we would like to pass on as much savings as possible to our online customers.
> 
> 3) Like most other retailers online, we occasionally have an exclusive online sale, valid only online and for a limited time only.
> 
> Note, our physical stores **will not** be able to price match our online listings or prices.
