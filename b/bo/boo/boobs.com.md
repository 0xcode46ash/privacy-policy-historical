Your continued use of the Boobs.com website following the posting of changes to these terms indicates your acceptance of those changes.

**A Special Note about Children**

Children under the age of 13 are not eligible to use our services, and we ask that anyone under 13 please not submit any personal information to us or use the site in any manner. We believe that is important that parents supervise their children when they are online. As a result, we ask that individuals between the ages of 13 and 18 use this service only in conjunction with parents or guardians and only with their permission.

**Use of Cookies**

Cookies are pieces of information that a Website transfers to your computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies make browsing the Internet easier for you by saving your preferences while you access a Website. Boobs.com never saves passwords in cookies. By showing how and when users use a website, cookies help us see which areas are popular and which are not. Many improvements and updates to the Boobs.com web content are based on such data as total number of visitors and pages viewed. This information is most easily tracked with cookies. We use the information from cookies to provide services better tailored to our users’ needs. Boobs.com uses cookies primarily in two ways. First, we use them to specify unique preferences so that you do not have to tell us repeatedly about the content you are interested in. Secondly, we use cookies to track user trends and patterns, so we can improve areas of the Boobs.com online experience that our users find valuable. While both of these activities depend on the use of a cookie, visitors to Boobs.com always have the option of disabling cookies via their browser preferences. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. Please note that some parts of the Boobs.com service may not function properly or may be considerably slower if you refuse cookies. For example, you may have difficulty entering contests, or playing games. You may occasionally get cookies directly from our advertisers. Boobs.com does not control these cookies.

We cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personally identifiable information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. For example, we may be forced to disclose information to the government or third parties under certain circumstances, or third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications.

**Linked Sites**

For your convenience, this website contains links to other websites. Boobs.com is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. Users should be aware that when they are on Boobs.com, they could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. There are links to other sites from Boobs.com pages that take you outside our service. For example, if you click on a banner advertisement, doing so may direct you off of Boobs.com.
