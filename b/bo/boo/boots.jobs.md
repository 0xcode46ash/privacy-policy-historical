# Privacy Policy | Boots Jobs

**1.     Our promise to you**  
Boots is committed to protecting your privacy.   We will always keep your personal information safe and will never sell it to third parties.  We’ll be clear and open with you about why we collect your personal information and how we use it. Where you have choices, we’ll explain them to you and respect your wishes.  

**2.     Who’s in control of your information?**  
Throughout this Privacy Policy, ‘we’ or ‘Boots’ means Walgreens Boots Alliance Services Limited which, for the purposes of the Data Protection Act 1998, is registered as a ‘Data Controller’ with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).  Details are published on a register on the ICO website at [http://ico.org.uk](http://ico.org.uk/), where you can also find lots of useful information about Data Protection, what it means to you as an individual and how it applies to companies like Boots.   You can find out more about the companies that make up the Walgreen Boots Alliance group on our website <http://www.walgreensbootsalliance.com/>.

     **3.     Using information about you**  
We use the personal information you provide to set up your Boots Jobs account, notify you of suitable vacancies if you have asked us to do so, and process any applications you make.  If you apply for a job at Boots we may use your information to carry out checks with external sources such as the DBS and fraud prevention agencies to verify your identity and assess your suitability for the role.  For this purpose, we may also access information about you from publicly-available sources such as Facebook or Google.

If you apply for a job with Boots, some of the information we ask you to provide may be sensitive in nature, such as information about your health. We will only ask for sensitive information where we have a specific need for it and will always tell you why we need it.  We will not use it in any other way or share it with unauthorised third parties. 

If your job application is successful, the information you give during the application process will form part of your employee record and will be used to administer your employment and manage your career at Boots.

If your Boots Jobs account is inactive for 12 months we may close it, and you may ask us to close your account at any time.  We will keep your personal information for a limited time after the account is closed to enable us to fulfil our legal and regulatory obligations, carry out internal validation and deal with any queries.  ****

**4.     Information We Collect Online: Cookies**  
A 'cookie' is a file in your web browser that enables us to recognise your computer when you visit the Boots Jobs website and make using the site quicker and easier.  Cookies are also essential to the functioning of certain parts of the site and we use them to collect information about how the site is used.  The Boots Jobs website uses Cookies in the following ways:

  * **Making our website work:**  
These Cookies are essential so that you can move around the site and log in to your account. 
  * **Enabling the features of the website:**  
These Cookies allow our website to remember choices you have made, such as your user name and help us provide you with a better, more personal experience.  
  * **Monitoring and improving the performance of the website:**  
These Cookies collect information about how visitors use the site, e.g. which pages they visit most often or how many visitors complete an application.   We share this information with external companies that carry out analysis to help us improve our website, but the information is aggregated and does not identify individual people.



Some parts of our site need Cookies in order to function correctly.  By default, Cookies should be enabled on your computer or device, and although you can ‘disable’ them in your browser this will affect your experience of the website and you may experience technical problems with some of the site’s features.  

If you'd still prefer to restrict, block or delete Cookies from this or any other website, it’s easy to do in your internet browser.  Each browser is different, so you’ll need to go to the 'help' menu on your browser and look for how to change your ‘cookie preferences’.

For independent information about Cookies, visit [www.aboutCookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) 

**5.     Privacy, Cookies and shared computers**  
If you log in to the site from a shared computer, such as in an internet cafe or from a colleague’s computer at work, Cookies may cause your e-mail address or user name to display in the login field to anyone who uses the site on that computer after you.  You can avoid this by clearing the Cookies stored by the web browser.  The option to do this is normally in the ‘Tools’ dropdown menu at the top of the browser window.

**6.     Sharing your information outside the Walgreens Boots Alliance Group**  
Boots may share your personal information with external companies that provide services on our behalf.  Where we do this we ensure they give your information the same level of care and security as we do.  

We may share your Personal Information with third parties where required or permitted by law, if we believe we need to do so to protect our rights, or to comply with legal proceedings.  In such cases we will always do so legally and with due regard to your privacy.

If ownership of all or part of our business changes or we undergo a reorganisation (including a merger or transfer between Walgreens Boots Alliance companies), we will transfer your personal information to the new owner or successor company so we can continue to provide our services.

**7.     Changes to this Privacy Policy**  
This Privacy Policy was updated in February 2015.  We may review it from time to time so we recommend that you check back here occasionally.  If we make any changes that we think may significantly affect you, particularly if they could have an impact on your rights under the Data Protection Act, we will notify you.

**8.      Staying in control of your information**  
We respect the fact that your personal information is _**your**_ information, and we’ll make it easy for you to update or change your personal details.  Please help us to help you by letting us know if your contact details change or if you spot any errors in the information we hold about you.  

If you would like a copy of the information Boots holds about you or have any queries about the way Boots handles your personal information, please contact our Customer Service Centre at <http://www.boots.com/en/Help/Contact-Us/>.
