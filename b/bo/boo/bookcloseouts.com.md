### Policies

Our policies are separated into the following categories for your convenience.

****|Your Profile | Privacy Policy  | Security |  Cookies | Satisfaction Guarantee | Return Policy  |

**Your Profile**

We collect profile information from you so that we can serve you better. There are a number of forms within our site that have been created so that you can provide us with this information. The one that you are most likely to have filled in is the registration form.

  1. We need a name and a billing/shipping address so that we can ship your purchase to the address of your choice.
  2. We require an email address because we correspond by email if we have questions or information about your order. Your email address is also the username for your account.
  3. We request a phone number because it is a good back up in case the email address is misspelled in the registration information and we need to phone you.
  4. When you submit your profile information on our forms, that information is sent through a secure, encrypted area which cannot be accessed by outsiders.
  5. Your personal profile is kept in our secure databases that only our company can access. 



**Privacy Policy**

We respect your privacy and only request the information that we absolutely require in order to provide you with excellent customer service. If we are missing any of the registration information, then we will not be able to serve you as efficiently as we would prefer.

Our commitment to you:

  1. We never share your profile information with other companies or organizations.
  2. We do not collect any information from you without your knowledge.
  3. We do not keep your credit card information on file; once it goes to the bank, we never see it again.



**Security**

BookCloseOuts.com has been selling online for over two years now and we have never had a security issue. We are very proud of our clean record and we continue to improve and update our site to make sure that we provide secure and safe purchase transactions to our customers.

Our commitment to you:

  1. All on-site transactions are securely encrypted. 
  2. We do NOT keep you credit card information on file. It is passed to the bank, and we never see it again.
  3. The amount being charged to your credit card is authorized by the bank when you make your purchase. That is the maximum amount that will be charged to your credit card for that order. We cannot raise the amount.



**Cookies**

We use cookies appropriately to enhance the security and navigation of our site. If you have your cookies turned off, you will not be able to use our shopping system.

  1. A cookie is a little string of text that is entered into the memory of your browser.
  2. Cookies are not programs and they do not carry viruses.
  3. We use cookies to make our site more secure and more user friendly.
  4. Our highest priority is to offer you secure and safe credit card transactions and cookies help us do that.



**Satisfaction Guarantee**

All our books have a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy with your purchase, just send it back to us for refund or exchange. Books must be returned to us within 15 days of when you receive them. Please note we subscribe to standard practice in the mail-order business in that your refund may not include shipping and handling charges. 

**Return Policy**

Again, all of our books have a 100% customer satisfaction guarantee. If you're not happy with your purchase, just send it back to us for full refund or exchange. Books must be returned to us within 15 days of when you receive them. Please note that your full refund may not include shipping and handling charges. 

**Return Procedure**

  1. Obtain a Return Authorization Number (RAN) by contacting our Customer Service department by [email](mailto:service@bookcloseouts.com) (service@bookcloseouts.com) or phone (1-888-402-7323 or 905-687-8881).
  2. For our own reference, please state why the product is being returned.
  3. Include ON and IN your returned package the RAN.



Once we receive your returned product, we will credit your credit card with the appropriate amount.
