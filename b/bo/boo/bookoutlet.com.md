## Privacy Policy

Our commitment to you:

  1. We never share your profile information with, or sell it to other companies or organizations.
  2. We do not collect any information from you without your knowledge.



### Personal Information

A number of forms exist on our site (such as a registration form) that ask you for personal information. The following list explains why we require this data: 

  1. We need a name and a billing/shipping address so we can send your purchase statement and purchase to the address of your choice.
  2. We require your email address so we can communicate with you regarding any questions or concerns about your order. Your e-mail address is also the username for your account.
  3. We request a phone number as a means of contacting you in case your e-mail address is misspelled in the registration information.



We respect your privacy and only request information necessary for providing great [customer service](https://web.archive.org/Tickets/Create). If we are missing any registration information, we cannot serve you as efficiently as preferred. 

We receive your personal data through a secure, encrypted area which cannot be reached by outsiders. Your information is stored in a protected database that only our company can access. 

## Security Policy

Book Outlet has been selling online for over 17 years and has never encountered a security issue. 

Our commitment to you: 

  1. All onsite transactions are securely encrypted.
  2. We do not keep your credit card information on file; once it goes to the bank, we never see it again.
  3. When you place an order, the bank will authorize the total amount to be charged on your credit card. However, your credit card is not charged until your order is ready for shipment. Any adjustments on the price of your order will be made at this time. The final cost of your purchase will never exceed the amount initially authorized by you and your bank.



### Cookies

We use cookies for the following reasons:

  1. Determine if you are logged on to our site or not
  2. Keep track of your user preferences
  3. Analyze user traffic on our site in order to provide a superior user experience
