**Privacy & Cookie Policy**

**Introduction**

Livebookings Holdings Limited, with its registered address at 5th Floor, Elizabeth House, 39 York Road, London, SE1 7NQ +44 (0)20 7199 4300 (“ **us** ” “ **we** ” or “ **our** ” for short) is committed to protecting the privacy of users of our website at [www.bookatable.com](http://www.bookatable.com/) (the “ **Website** ”).

This privacy policy (the “ **Privacy and Cookie Policy** ”) explains our policy regarding any information you might supply to us (or that we might collect from you) when you visit the Website or use certain services offered via the Website. Any such information shall be used in accordance with the permissions granted by you and in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “ **Act** ”). We are the data controller for the purposes of the Act.

**Please note** that any information you provide in the course of submitting reviews on the Website will be subject to our Privacy Policy. There are important differences between how your personal information is handled by Shopzilla in the context of that service, and how we handle information relating to you in the context of your use of the Website generally, so please read the Privacy Policy carefully. For the purposes of the Act, Shopzilla is the data controller of – and therefore responsible for safeguarding – any personal information you provide in the course of using the _Review_ feature of this Website.

**Summary of key principles**

We’ve set out below a summary of the key points of our Privacy Policy, so that you can get a quick understand of how we use your information and how it is protected. For more information on these points, please read the remainder of this Privacy Policy in full.

  * We typically collect two types of information about you: (i) information that you provide that personally identifies you (such as your name, email address or contact details); and (ii) information that does not identify you, but which is relevant to your use of the Website (such as the pages visited on our Website and the dates and times of your visit).
  * The information is stored on secure servers in UK and Ireland. If that location changes, then we will update this Privacy Policy accordingly.
  * We use this information to make the Website available to you, remember your preferences, facilitate restaurant bookings, conduct promotions or prize draws that you have entered, monitor traffic on and performance of our Website, and to contact you with information about our services and those of our business partners (where you have given us your consent to do so).
  * We may disclose information about you to our selected business partners for the above purposes (such as the restaurant with whom you wish to make a booking), and to certain other third parties in the circumstances described in more detail in the full Privacy Policy below.
  * Our Website uses cookies, but you can disable these by adjusting your browser settings.
  * We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our business practices and/or applicable law and regulation. Please check this policy for updates regularly.
  * If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, you can email us at [privacy@bookatable.com](mailto:privacy@bookatable.com).



Our Privacy Policy is intended to assist you in making informed decisions when using our Website and our services. Please take a minute to read and understand the policy in full.

**What information do we collect?**

The information that we collect about you falls into two categories, (together, the “ **Information** ”):

  * personal information such as your name, address, telephone number, date of birth, age and email address that you provide us with when you make a reservation or when you send us an email; and
  * website use information – our Website utilises a standard technology called “cookies” (see explanation below, “What are Cookies?”) and web server logs to collect information about how our Website is used. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Website, and the websites visited just before and just after our Website. Our Website also uses the IP address of your computer to recognise your geographic location, so that we can provide localised content and language to you.



**Your consent**

By using our Website you consent to our collection and use of your Information as described in this Privacy Policy. If we change our privacy policies and procedures, we will post an updated version of this Policy on our Website to keep you aware of what information we collect, how we use it and under what circumstances we may disclose it.

**How do we use the information that you provide to us?**

We use your Information for the purposes of:

  * making the Website available to you by recognising the IP address of your computer and any preferences you may have indicated on earlier visits;
  * facilitating restaurant bookings that you wish to make using the Websites, by passing your personal details on to the relevant restaurants;
  * conducting promotions or prize draws that you have entered using the Website;
  * monitoring visitor traffic on our Website and conducting analysis on the performance of our Website so that we can improve user experience; and
  * contacting you with information about our services which we think might be of interest to you, and sharing your information with select business partners so that they may also get in touch with you, and those of our business partners. Please note that this will only be done if you have ‘opted in’ to receive email communication at the point of registration or when making a booking. You may notify us at any time if you do not wish to receive these offers by clicking on the ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ link in those emails, or by emailing us at [hello@bookatable.com](mailto:hello@bookatable.com) stating ‘UNSUBSCRIBE’ in the subject field. Please note that it can take up to 72 hours for our systems to update your change in subscription status.



**Cookies**

In order to comply with new rules, we use a system of classifying the different types of cookies which we use on the Website, or which may be dropped by third parties through our websites. The classification was developed by the International Chamber of Commerce UK and explains more about which cookies we use, why we use them, and the functionality you will lose if you decide you don't want to have them on your device. 

**What are Cookies?**

Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website. Cookies are then sent back to the originating website on each subsequent visit, or to another website that recognises that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website to recognise a user's device. 

Persistent cookies remain on a user's device for the period of time specified in the cookie. They are activated each time that the user visits the website that created that particular cookie. 

Session cookies allow website operators to link the actions of a user during a browser session. A browser session starts when a user opens the browser window and finishes when they close the browser window. Session cookies are created temporarily. Once you close the browser, all session cookies are deleted. 

Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests. 

You can find more information about cookies at www.allaboutcookies.org and www.youronlinechoices.eu.

**Cookies used on the Website**

A list of all the cookies used on the Website by category is set out below.

  

* **Strictly necessary cookies** \- these enable services you have specifically asked for. For those types of cookies that are strictly necessary, no consent is required. 

These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website. Without these cookies services you have asked for, like restaurant booking, cannot be provided. 

* **Performance cookies** \- these collect anonymous information on the pages visited. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. 

These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Website, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only used to improve how the Website works. 

* **Functionality cookies** \- these remember choices you make to improve your experience. By using the Website, you agree that we can place these types of cookies on your device. 

These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your user name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages that you can customise. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymised and they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites. 

* **Targeting or advertising cookies** \- these collect information about your browsing habits in order to make advertising relevant to you and your interests. 

These cookies are used to deliver adverts more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They remember that you have visited a website and this information is shared with other organisations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organisation. 

* **Behavioural advertising and online privacy** \- A guide to behavioural advertising and online privacy has been produced by the internet advertising industry which can be found at www.youronlinechoices.eu. The guide contains an explanation of the IAB's self-regulatory scheme to allow you greater control of the advertising you see. 
* **Using browser settings to manage cookies** \- The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on settings or visiting the website of its manufacturer. 

However, because cookies allow you to take advantage of some of the Website's essential features, we recommend you leave them turned on. For example, if you block or otherwise reject cookies you will not be able to make a restaurant reservation. If you leave cookies turned on, remember to clear your cookies when you finish using a shared computer.
