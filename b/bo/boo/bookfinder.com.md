# BookFinder.com: Privacy Policy

| 

BookFinder.com is committed to your privacy. All of us here make heavy use of the Internet outside of our involvement with this site; it's important to us that we deal with your data the way we want our own to be dealt with.

  * **We will not share any information on specific users or their searches with third parties.**
  * We believe in the principle of minimal data collection. We will not ask users for any more personal information than is needed for basic operation. 
  * Any information collected about our site's users will always be analyzed in the aggregate. 
  * All information collected about our site's users is stored on our secure servers. Access to that information is strictly controlled and limited to authorized members of the BookFinder.com team. 
  * Our site is also usable without cookies, and via anonymizing proxies. Some of the advertising on our site is supplied by a third party; they may use cookies, but do so under a strict privacy policy, audited by TrustE. If you're uncomfortable with cookie technology, you may want to disable cookies on your web browser. 



We support the efforts of organizations like the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](http://www.eff.org/) and the [American Civil Liberties Union](http://www.aclu.org/issues/privacy/hmprivacy.html) in their efforts to safeguard privacy rights, on- and offline.

### Mailing Lists

Membership in our mailing lists is anonymous. We will not share the addresses of members or anyone's membership status with any third party.

We hate spam with a passion; like many of our users, we have been victimized by the attacks of spammers. If you live in the US, you may want to join us in supporting anti-spam organizations like [CAUCE](http://www.cauce.org/).
