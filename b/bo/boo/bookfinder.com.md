# BookFinder.com: Privacy policy

BookFinder.com is committed to your privacy. We're heavy Internet users; we treat _your_ data the way we want other online services to treat _ours_.

  * **We will not share any information on specific users or their searches with third parties.**
  * We believe in the principle of minimal data collection. We will not ask users for any more personal information than is needed for basic operation.
  * Any information collected about our site's users will always be analyzed in the aggregate.
  * All information collected about our site's users is stored on our secure servers. Access to that information is strictly controlled and limited to authorized members of the BookFinder.com team.



### Mailing Lists

Membership in any of our mailing lists is anonymous; we will not share member addresses or membership status with any third party. Your participation in our many-to-many lists (e.g. the BookFinder Insider mailing list) will obviously be disclosed to other list members, should you choose to post.
