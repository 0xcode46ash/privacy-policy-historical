# BookCrossing - privacy - FREE YOUR BOOKS!

BookCrossing respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use the BookCrossing.com site. Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission, as explained in this privacy policy. 

**Children under the age of 13**   
When someone under the age of 13 attempts to register with BookCrossing, we ask that he or she have a parent, teacher or librarian establish a BookCrossing Account for them. When any user registers for a BookCrossing account, we require first name, email address, birth date, city, state/province, country, and zip code. BookCrossing uses this information to create and maintain accounts, for research, and may use this information to customize the content seen on our pages. Under the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, no web site operator can require, as a condition of participation in an activity, that a child under the age of 13 disclose more information than is reasonably necessary. BookCrossing abides by this requirement. 

**BookCrossing and Cookies**  
Upon your first visit to BookCrossing, BookCrossing sends a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique member. BookCrossing uses cookies to improve the quality of our service. BookCrossing does this by storing member preferences in cookies. BookCrossing will not disclose its cookies to third parties. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of BookCrossing may not function properly if you refuse cookies. 

**What Information Do We Collect?**  
BookCrossing does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information on your member profile page. 

**Links to Other Sites**   
The sites linked to by BookCrossing are developed by people over whom BookCrossing exercises no control. These other sites may send their own cookies to members, collect data, or solicit personal information. 

**With Whom Does BookCrossing Share Information?**   
BookCrossing does not share your personal membership information with any other company, individual, or organization. We do not and will not "sell" our member data to any advertisers, and nobody except us will ever contact you based on the information you provide to us. Note that your Member Profile page has two important options: your _Newsletter_ preference, and your _Allow Members to Contact You Anonymously_ option. You can turn these _on_ or _off_ at any time. 

**Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**  
By using the BookCrossing site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy. BookCrossing may decide to change this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will notify all our members by email so that you are always aware of the information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances we disclose it. 

**What can I do if I have additional questions?**  
Feel free to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/contact) any time and we'll answer any additional questions you may have.
