Booster collects information about the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of all visitors to our Site. An IP address is a number assigned to your computer automatically when you use the internet. This information is only collected in the aggregate (in other words, we are not able to monitor your individual usage of the site) and helps us monitor site traffic patterns in order to improve our Services. 

This Site uses Cookies for some interactive features. A Cookie is a small amount of data, which includes an anonymous unique identifier that is sent to your browser from a website's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.

Booster may also use third party application tracking services like Google Retargeting code, Google Analytics, KISS Metrics, and Bing, to help understand the use of our Services and Site(s).

These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us and are obligated to keep your information confidential. Some of our pages utilize framing techniques to serve content from our service providers while preserving the look and feel of our site, such as when you enter credit card information or your résumé when applying for a job with us.

  3. Aggregate Information: We may share user information in the aggregate (i.e. non identifiable) with third parties, such as advertisers and content distributors. For example, we may disclose the number of users that have been exposed to, or clicked on, advertisements.
  4. Facebook and Twitter: We allow users to set up unique personal profiles either directly with us or via third-party sign-on services. To enrich user experience, we request and display some personal information to others so as to allow our users to identify each other. You may be able to connect your Booster account to your accounts on third party services like Facebook or Twitter, in which case we may collect and store information identifying your account with the third party service. We use the information to help you connect and share public content with your friends and followers based on your choice of privacy settings when connecting Booster to Twitter or Facebook.

If Booster is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets or bankruptcy, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Site of any change in ownership or uses of your Personally Identifiable Information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your Personally Identifiable Information.

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
