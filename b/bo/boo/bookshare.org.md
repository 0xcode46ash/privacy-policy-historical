# Bookshare.org - Privacy Policy

  | 

Bookshare.org Privacy Policy

Bookshare.org is a nonprofit web site dedicated to providing accessible books and other materials ("Content") to people with print disabilities. We collect personal information about our users in order to deliver a better service and to meet our legal obligations under the copyright law. We do not provide commercial entities with this personal information for commercial or marketing purposes. This Privacy Policy is intended to fully inform you about our uses of the information we collect.

Personal Information

Under the copyright law exception that allows Bookshare.org to provide copyrighted material to people with print disabilities, Bookshare.org must receive proof of a print-related disability for each user that wishes to download copyrighted Content, as well as the user’s name, address and whether or not the user is a minor. We will also request other contact information, such as e-mail address and telephone number. We will use this information for the following purposes: 

  * To communicate general information about Bookshare.org services to Bookshare.org users.
  * To communicate with Bookshare.org users about their account status, renewal, and any problems with their account.
  * Possibly, to share qualification data with other nonprofit organizations serving people with disabilities, to streamline the process of verifying eligibility for services.
  * In the case of minors, to limit access to Content coded as adult Content.
  * To investigate and support legal proceedings concerning alleged abuse of the copyright laws.

In addition, we may contact the agency or individual that provides the verification of a qualifying disability to insure that the legal requirements of the service have been met. We will not sell or otherwise provide this contact information to commercial entities.

Financial Information

Bookshare.org is a subscription service. As such, it will be necessary for those wanting to become full members to pay a user fee using a credit card or other financial instrument. This financial information will be maintained confidentially by Bookshare.org and its authorized third party billing services, and only used for user-authorized fee transactions. Information shared with these authorized third party billing services includes credit card number and expiration date from subscribers. Users may have the option to choose automatic renewal options.

Download Transaction Information

Bookshare.org will also maintain transaction logs of the materials downloaded by its users. We will use this information for the following purposes: 

  * To flag usage that is potentially in violation of our terms of use or the copyright law.
  * In cases of suspected abuse where copyrighted Content has been made available to unqualified individuals, to trace copyrighted Content back to the user using user-identifiable information embedded in downloaded Content.
  * To provide users with information about the Content downloaded under their accounts.
  * To gather statistical data about usage patterns for the improvement of the Bookshare.org service.
  * Possibly, to provide suggested content based on the users past reading patterns.

We will not provide access to any third parties to the information contained in our transaction logs, except in connection with investigation of or for actual legal proceedings concerning potential abuse. We will not share information about an individuals frequency of use or reading habits with the referring agency or individual, except that number of books downloaded by individual with Multiple Subscriber Accounts such as school accounts shall be available to the person(s) responsible for those organizational accounts.

Upload & Review Transaction Information

As part of its efforts to build the Bookshare.org collection, Bookshare.org accepts uploads of Content and reviews of books and of particular versions of books from its qualified users, organizations and volunteers. Bookshare.org will maintain transaction logs of these uploads, and will use this information extensively. Users are not required to provide such uploads. Specifically, Bookshare.org will use this information: 

  * To track the quality of uploads and reviews by users, organizations and volunteers, and may identify the uploading person with the Content on the website, and may also publicize particularly high quality uploaders of Content or reviewers.
  * To track uploading activity in violation of copyright law or Bookshare.org policies, such as content that is not represented correctly, incomplete content, content from other ebook suppliers and so on.

It may be possible that another service such as a book retailer or a maker of adaptive software can be accessed via a link on the Bookshare.org site. We will not provide specific information about an individual to any such service. However, it is possible that the linked service may receive information that a link on Bookshare.org was used to access their site. It is also possible that such a non-Bookshare.org site may collect personal information on its site. Bookshare.org is not responsible in any way for information provided or used at sites not under its control.

Receiving information from Us

Users may choose to "opt out" of receiving newsletters or other promotional materials from Bookshare.org. In addition, users may unsubscribe to any of our electronic mailings at any time by following the instructions at the end of every mailing. Users may also "opt out" of receiving materials from Bookshare.org by contacting us at [support@bookshare.org](mailto:support@bookshare.org). Members cannot opt out of receiving information from us about their accounts.

Surveys & Contests

Our site may request information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and individuals therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). Contact information will be used to notify the winners and to award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and user satisfaction of this site.

Security

Protection of users information is important to Bookshare.org. When users submit sensitive information via the website, that information is protected both online and off-line.

 _Online Protection - Encryption Technology_

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information, that information is encrypted before transmission and is protected with the standard encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our registration page, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are on a page that is not secure. Web browsers can also be set to alert you if you are on a page that is secure, which is an alternative method for individuals who use screen readers to access web pages. This icon may not always appear when you are viewing encrypted pages on the site due to the use of multiple frames. However, the information you provide will be encrypted before transmission. To ensure that SSL technology is active, you must use an SSL-enabled browser such as Netscape Navigator 3.0 or higher or Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher. If you have questions regarding security with your specific browser, please refer to your browser's help files or documentation.

 _Off-Line Security_

All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, has restricted access in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer support representative) are granted password-protected access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices.

Children

The privacy and protection of children is of importance to us at Bookshare.org. For this reason, individuals who are less than 18 years of age will need the permission of a parent or other legal guardian to join. This legal guardian may be entitled to information about the usage of the minor Bookshare.org member. In addition, material which has been rated as having adult Content will not be available to those under 18 years of age.

Shared Responsibility

Security is a shared responsibility of Bookshare.org and all Bookshare.org site users, who have the capability to enhance the security of their own accounts: 

  * Do not allow others to use your password.
  * Change your password regularly.
  * Select unique and non-obvious passwords which are different from your sign in email address.
  * Sign out when you've completed your Bookshare.org session.

Of course, this security is dependent upon users protecting their account information and access to their computer while signed in.

Use of Data

The content information uploaded to Bookshare.org by users is available for Bookshare.org to utilize for the support of our nonprofit mission. The primary limitation in our use of this information is based on our legal obligations, as we assess them in our reasonable judgment. Our uses of uploaded content information may include, but are not limited to, sharing the information with other nonprofit or for-profit organizations, licensing the information for other nonprofit or commercial uses and transferring the operation of the Bookshare.org service to a for-profit entity. If the operation of Bookshare.org is legally transferred to another entity, all user data may likewise be transferred. Revenues obtained from the provision of the Bookshare.org service or from other uses of the uploaded information are exclusively for the use of Bookshare.orgs nonprofit parent organization, and may be used to support Bookshare.org, related projects or other nonprofit objectives as it sees fit and as permitted by applicable laws.

No International Use

Bookshare,org does not knowingly permit international users, so this Policy may not comply with EU Privacy Rules. We will, however, not knowingly provide any personal information to any EU entity.

Notification of Changes

If we change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users through an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner.
