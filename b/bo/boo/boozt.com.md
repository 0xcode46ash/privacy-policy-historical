### Boozt.com Privacy Statement Information

Because we gather information about the customers of Boozt.com we feel you should fully understand the terms and conditions surrounding the capture and use of that information.

  
Information Boozt.com gathers and tracks

Boozt.com gathers two types of information about users: 1) Data that users provide through optional, voluntary registration on our site, and 2) aggregated tracking information derived mainly by tallying page views throughout our site. Such information enables us to better tailor our content to readers' needs and help us better understand the demographics of our audience and customers.

Boozt collects the following information from purchases through the online store: 

  * Name
  * Address
  * Email Address
  * Telephone
  * Fax
  * Software Purchased
  * Software Registration Code (where applicable)



This information is provided on the contractual understanding that it is to be used solely and exclusively for the purpose of tracking customer software registrations and providing technical support, as is the standard practice in the industry.

  
Boozt.com does not provide this information to any other third parties under any circumstances.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@Boozt.com](mailto:privacy@boozt.com)

  
Electronic Newsletters

Boozt.com offers free electronic newsletters to users. Boozt.com gathers the e-mail addresses of users who voluntarily subscribe. Customers may remove themselves from any mailing list by following the instructions contained in every newsletter.

  
Usage tracking

Boozt.com tracks user traffic patterns throughout Boozt.com and this information is correlated with data about individual users. Overall usage statistics, according to a user's domain name, browser type and MIME type gotten by reading this information from the browser string (information contained in every user's browser), are also broken down.

Boozt.com also tracks and catalogs the search terms that customers enter into our search tools, but this tracking is never associated with individual users.

  
Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such including a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited. But the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Boozt.com uses cookies to track the items you add to your shopping card and to enforce security rules regarding software that you download.

If you've set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies, you will receive the warning message with each cookie.

You can refuse cookies by turning them off in your browser. However, you need to have cookies turned on to purchase software through Boozt.com.

  
Use of the information

Boozt.com uses any information voluntarily given by our users to enhance their experience on our site, whether to provide interactive or personalized elements on the sites or to better prepare future content based on the interests of our users.

As stated above, Boozt.com uses information that users voluntarily provide in order to send out electronic newsletters and enable users to participate in polls and message boards. We send out newsletters to subscribers on a regular schedule (daily or weekly, depending on the newsletter) and occasionally send out special editions when we think subscribers might be particularly interested in something we are doing. Boozt.com never shares newsletter mailing lists with any third parties, including advertisers or partners.

We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don't like based on traffic to those areas. Boozt.com does not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you.

We track search terms entered in our search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. But we don't track which terms a particular user enters.

Boozt.com creates aggregrate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Boozt.com never shares individual personal information with anyone, so an advertiser will never know that a specific user clicked their ad.

Boozt.com uses the above-described information to tailor our content to suit your needs and help our advertisers better understand our audience demographics. We do not share information about individual users with any third party, with the exceptions noted previously.

Questions regarding this statement should be directed to [privacy@Boozt.com](mailto:privacy@boozt.com)
