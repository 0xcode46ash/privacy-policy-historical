Cookies come in many forms. We have set out the main types and categories of cookies that are used below. This section refers to all types and categories of cookies and not just those we use on our website.

**First and third-party cookies** – whether a cookie is first-party or third-party refers to the domain placing the cookie. First-party cookies are those set by a website that is being visited by the user, the website displayed in the URL window e.g. www.bookmarkcontent.com. Third-Party cookies are cookies that are set by a domain other than that of the website being visited by the user. If a user visits a website and another entity sets a cookie through that website, this would be a third-party cookie.
