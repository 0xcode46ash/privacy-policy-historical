# Privacy Policy | BookIt.com® | Powered by FROM™ Technology

For our guests, privacy is of the utmost concern. With the rise in identity theft and fraudulent use of financial information, BookIt.com® has made sure that your privacy and the information collected from you is guarded and secured with the most secure technologies. The Privacy Policy covers treatment of personally identifiable information collected on the BookIt.com website. 

BookIt.com® collects personally identifiable information in order to process reservations. We ask for your name, email address, street address, zip code, and, (when processing a reservation only) your credit card number. BookIt.com® also automatically receives and records information on our server logs from your browser including your IP Address and the page you requested, along with requests for specific price quotes for lodging. BookIt.com® uses information for these general purposes: to fulfill your requests for reservations or information and to contact you about specials and new products, as well as to determine what offerings are of most interest to our users. 

Information Sharing and Disclosure    
BookIt.com® will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information to anyone. We need to send the information to companies who work as partners with BookIt.com® to provide a product or service to you. (Unless we tell you differently, these companies do not have any right to use the personally identifiable information we provide to them beyond what is necessary to assist us.). This information is limited to only necessary information in reference to any reservations you may make online. Credit Card numbers are never emailed, but are only accessible to our partners who log into a password protected secure site. All such credit card views are logged by BookIt.com® as a final protection to our guests. Usually, only top-level personnel at a company are privileged to have access to credit card numbers. Cookies    
BookIt.com® may set and access cookies on your computer. Web cookies are identifiers which let a Web server know that you are the same person that accessed the server the last time you accessed it. This makes an extended interaction possible. Your Ability to Edit and Delete Your Account Information and Preferences    
BookIt.com® gives you the ability to edit your Account Information and preferences at any time. Security    
Your BookIt.com® Account Information is password-protected for your privacy and security. In certain areas BookIt.com® uses industry-standard 128 bit SSL-encryption to protect data transmissions. Changes to this Privacy Policy
