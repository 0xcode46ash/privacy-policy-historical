# Bank of Hawaii - Privacy Policy

Thank you for visiting Bank of Hawaii's web site. We understand the importance of customer privacy and want you to know what information is collected on-line and how we use it. 

Contact Information You Provide Us and How It's Used   


When you supply us with your postal or e-mail address or telephone number online, you may receive periodic mailings or telephone contact from us with information on new products, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings or contact, please call us or write us at the telephone number or address shown on your account statement. Please provide us with your exact name, street and e-mail address. Even if you make this choice, we may still send you e-mail to deliver your statements (which may include marketing materials) or give you account-related notices or other information. 

E-mails   


We preserve your e-mail address, our response and the original content of your e-mail for a period of time so we can efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this for legal, regulatory and account servicing requirements. Regular Internet e-mail is not a secure form of communication. Any information sent via e-mail should be of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature. Submitting information via one of our online contact forms is secure as we employ encryption. 

Web-based Cookies   


Pacific Century uses temporary cookies to store customer usage information to facilitate your access to restricted web pages during a single online session. These cookies expire after a limited time, do not contain any personal information and are not shared with any other web site. We do not store any e-mail addresses, user names or other personal information in cookies. 

While you are logged on viewing your account information or conducting online transactions with Pacific Century, we recommend that you do not access other web sites during your online session. Always log off from your online session with Pacific Century before moving to or accessing other web sites and prior to turning off your computer. 

Some browsers allow you to reject cookies. However, if you set your browser to reject cookies, you may find that you are unable to conduct your online transactions with Pacific Century. If you choose NOT to accept cookies while accessing web pages on the Internet, we suggest that you enable acceptance of cookies when you are logged onto your online session with Pacific Century. For detailed instructions on enabling and disabling cookies, refer to your web browser's online HELP menu or user manual. 

Weblogs   


Our web servers automatically collect information that is aggregated without any personally identifiable data. We do not collect e-mail addresses nor do we combine any cookie information to determine who you are. From our web logs we collect date and time of access, IP address and the image/pages that were viewed. We use this information to analyze usage trends and learn how to better organize our web site. 

Surveys   


The information you provide from surveys and promotions will be used for internal marketing and for developing information that you may find useful. Additionally, we may inform you if a particular account or service would benefit you based on the information submitted. 

Contests   


We may occasionally run contests on our site and ask visitors for contact information (such as e-mail address or telephone number). Participation in these contests is not mandatory. However, if you choose to participate, we may send you information about the contest and our company. If you have participated in a past contest but no longer wish to remain on our contact list, please call us or write us at the telephone number or address shown on your account statement. Please provide us with your exact name, street and e-mail address.
