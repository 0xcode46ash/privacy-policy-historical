**Contact Information You Provide Us and How It's Used**  
When you supply us with your postal or e-mail address or telephone number online, you may receive periodic mailings or telephone contact from us with information on new products, services or upcoming events. If you do not wish to receive such mailings or contact, please call us or write us at the telephone number or address shown on your account statement.

Even if you make this choice, we may still send you e-mail to deliver your statements (which may include marketing materials) or give you account-related notices or other information. 

**E-mails**  
We preserve your e-mail address, our response and the original content of your e-mail for a period of time so we can efficiently handle any follow-up questions you may have. We also do this for legal, regulatory and account servicing requirements. Regular Internet e-mail is not a secure form of communication. Any information sent via e-mail should be of a non-sensitive and non-confidential nature. Submitting information via one of our online contact forms is secure as we employ encryption.
