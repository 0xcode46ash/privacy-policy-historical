# Boingo Wireless | Privacy Policy

#### 

Boingo Wireless, Inc. (“Boingo,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) is concerned about the privacy and security of your information. We want to make your experience with the Boingo® service as enjoyable and rewarding as possible, and also allow you to feel secure that your privacy interests are being respected.

  


Boingo collects certain information that is necessary to fully service your Boingo account. As a customer, you will be asked to provide Information that is needed in order to create your Boingo account and fulfill our service commitment to you such as your name, address, phone number, e-mail address and billing information. We treat this personal information that you provide to us as highly confidential. Boingo may use this Information for editorial and feedback purposes, marketing and promotional purposes, for statistical analysis and for product development. Your personal information, however, will never be sold to any company nor will it be shared with third parties, unless specifically stated otherwise or in special circumstances.

Like any business interested in attracting and offering the highest quality of service to customers, Boingo gathers voluntary demographic information about our customers. These questions seek to gain insight on such things as how an individual became aware of our service, their gender, occupation and travel preferences and practices. In addition, customer comments and inquiries are collected and stored for each customer that submits them. This information is collected and stored with the customer's individual Boingo account information. This information is kept completely private and confidential except as disclosed in the Use and Disclosure of information. 

Boingo occasionally conducts user surveys to better target our service offering to existing as well as new customers. We sometimes share aggregated demographic information in these surveys with various business partners that offer complimentary offerings to the Boingo service. This information is summarized, and information about specific individuals is never shared with any third party. Participation in our customer surveys is voluntary.

Boingo may offer incentive programs to customers, visitors to the Boingo Web site (www.boingo.com), the general public and individuals identified through direct mail lists. These offerings are promoted on the Web site, advertisements and press releases. At a minimum, required information includes name and e-mail address; in some cases, the customer must answer mandatory survey questions about other personal data or enter a program code. The information gathered in the entry form is used to verify the entrant's identity, to send the entrant an e-mail notification that their entry has been received, and to contact winners and/or prize recipients. Because the rules and terms of each program can vary, all information about each program is clearly posted during the event. All such programs are conducted in full accordance with United States federal and state laws.

Boingo has and may institute referral programs or similar programs, such as the “Tell a Friend” program. Boingo's “Tell a Friend” program allows customers to receive credit for each individual (a “Referral”) that, as a result of their recommendation, also becomes a customer. For a customer to receive a free month of service under this program, (1) the Referral must become a subscriber to Boingo Unlimited and remain a subscriber of Boingo Unlimited for more than 31 days; (2) the Referral cannot be an existing Boingo customer; and (3) the Referral cannot have been previously submitted to the “Tell a Friend” program by another person. Existing customers provide the e-mail address of the Referral, and Boingo may send an e-mail message to the Referral from the referring customer's e-mail address informing them of the Boingo service.

When you use Boingo’s services on a mobile device (such as your laptop or a smart phone), Boingo may collect and/or track certain geographic location information that is derived from your usage of the Boingo service such as usage patterns, travel patterns, Web site page views, traffic patterns and information about your geographic location. Boingo may use this tracking and location information for statistical purposes to improve our products and services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently.

  


To keep track of traffic on their servers, Web sites often store a small data file on your hard disk when you visit them. This file is commonly referred to as a “cookie.” A cookie file can contain user specific information, such as User ID, or it can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). Boingo uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, and to diagnose problems on our server and administer our site. Cookies enable you to enter all parts of the Boingo Web site, and are used to save your User ID on the login page (we encrypt the User ID for added security). In addition, cookie files help us assist you with questions about site navigation, functionality or performance. Partners also may use their own “cookies.” IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO HAVE WEB COOKIES PLACED ON YOUR COMPUTER, YOU SHOULD SET YOUR BROWSER TO REFUSE WEB COOKIES, WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT CERTAIN FEATURES OF THIS SITE MAY NOT FUNCTION PROPERLY WITHOUT THE AID OF WEB COOKIES. IF YOU REFUSE WEB COOKIES, YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY RESULTING LOSS OF FUNCTIONALITY.

We do not control the use of our partners' cookies and expressly disclaim responsibility for information collected through them.

Web sites may contain an electronic file called a “web beacon” that allows a website to track users who have visited that page or to access certain cookies. Boingo may use web beacons in the following ways: 

  * Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to track customers signing up at one of our hotspot locations.
  * Boingo may use web beacons within our Web sites in order to fulfill sponsored access campaigns or other promotions. 
  * Boingo may use web beacons to measure where customers leave the signup process in order to improve customer experience.
  * Boingo may use web beacons to track customers that come through our Web sites from advertisements or search engines.
  * Boingo may use web beacons to serve ads to customers after they leave our Web sites.



Boingo also records the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable Boingo to accurately perform our billing functions.

  


Except as described in this Section, Boingo will not divulge any of your personal information, contact, financial, bill history, or geographic location -- to any other organization unless (1) you give Boingo explicit and specific, prior permission (for example, if you opt-in to a sponsorship offer from one of our partners), (2) the disclosure is required by law or by legal process authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction, (3) Boingo suspects fraud by a customer involving Boingo, in which case Boingo may investigate and report any evidence, including personal information, to law enforcement officials and to the courts in the course of seeking remedies at law and equity, and/or (4) you make an inquiry, request or complaint that requires follow-up and we share your information with others to satisfy your inquiry.

Subject to the terms of this privacy policy, we may disclose information to our employees, contractors, affiliates, distributors, dealers, vendors and suppliers who process information on our behalf, participate with us in the provision or operation of our site or provide you with services.

We reserve the right to transfer all information in our possession to a successor entity in the event of a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy or other sale of all or a portion of our assets or business.  Other than to the extent ordered by a court, the use and disclosure of all transferred information will be subject to this privacy policy or to a new privacy policy if you are given notice of that new privacy policy and you affirmatively opt-in to accept it.  Information submitted or collected after a transfer, however, may be subject to a new privacy policy adopted by the successor entity.

We may email you about products and services that we believe may be of interest to you.  If you wish to opt-out of receiving marketing materials from us, please follow the instructions at the bottom of each email for opting out. 

In instances where Boingo and a partner jointly promote the Boingo service, Boingo may provide that partner certain information, such as name and e-mail address, for the sole purpose of allowing Boingo and the partner to evaluate the promotion.

Boingo may contact customers or Web site visitors regarding account status and changes to this privacy policy and any other policies or agreements relevant to Web site visitors. Boingo may use your information to disclose summary information to strategic and business partners. This is obtained by combining data from many individuals with the name and other identifiers removed. Boingo also may create aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns. This information may be used to negotiate with service providers who complement the Boingo service or assist us in our efforts to expand our customer base. 

Boingo opposes the e-mailing of any junk mail, and does not sell customer information to e-mail lists or telemarketers. If any of our partner sites engage in such practices, for any reason, Boingo will immediately investigate, and if appropriate, discontinue services with such parties. If you receive junk e-mail that mentions Boingo or its services, please send details to us at [info@boingo.com](mailto:info@boingo.com) and we will investigate promptly.

You can change your information at any time and as often as necessary via our self-care application which can be accessed at:  [https://my.boingo.com](https://my.boingo.com/).

Boingo automatically opts customers in to providing Boingo with information, as well as a separate opportunity to opt-in to certain location-tracking services, or receiving communications from us and our partners.

At any time, customers can contact Boingo to [opt-out](https://c01.client.boingo.com/unsubscribe/unsubscribe.app) of any of our promotions, programs, location-tracking services or contests via the following link: <https://c01.client.boingo.com/unsubscribe/unsubscribe.app>. Alternatively, customers can opt not to provide certain information when enrolling for the Boingo service or when participating in some programs and surveys, although choosing not to provide certain information may hinder our ability to complete your registration process. 

  


We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If we determine that we have collected personally identifiable information on children, we will promptly delete it from our system. We recommend that children who are 13-17 years old receive permission from a parent before gaining access to the Boingo service or sending information to Boingo or anyone else online.

  


Your account information is protected by a unique User Identification and password that is issued to you. Your User Identification and password should be kept confidential because it is the key to accessing the information held by Boingo about you. If your computer or other device is accessible to or by others, please log out of the Boingo site before you leave it. Security is also provided through your web browser, which supports 40, 56 or a 128-bit version of encryption with the SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) security protocol. When you visit the Boingo Web site, your personal account information is encrypted when transmitted across the Internet, using the highest degree of security applicable.

Boingo has instituted internal safeguards to reduce the likelihood of accidental disclosures and unintended access of your information (although it is impossible to eliminate this possibility completely). All employees, contractors and other companies engaged by Boingo are contractually required, through signed, internal non-disclosure agreements, to keep your Personal Information confidential and not to use it in any way other than what is necessary to perform their work for Boingo. Violations of these policies can result in termination in the case of employees, the severing of contractual obligations in the case of contractors and other companies, and in civil and criminal penalties if warranted and applicable by law. 

While Boingo uses reasonable measures to protect the security of your information, no security measures are foolproof, and Boingo does not guarantee that your information will remain confidential.

  


Because of the global nature of our services, there are some places where you cannot access the Boingo Wi-Fi Network. In these places, you may (1) manually search for available third party networks and, if required to do so, assent to Terms of Service or other click-through agreements; or (2) connect to other people’s Wi-Fi networks automatically by using the Boingo Wi-Finder tool if you opt-in to use this feature. Please see our [FAQs](http://www.boingo.com/faq/wifinder/) for more information about these options:   [http://www.boingo.com/faq/wifinder](http://www.boingo.com/faq/wifinder/).

Third parties are under no obligation to comply with this privacy policy with respect to information that you provide directly to those third parties or that those third parties collect for themselves. We do not control the third-party sites that may be accessible through this Site or Boingo’s services. Thus, this privacy policy does not apply to information provided to third-party sites or gathered by the third parties that operate them. Before visiting a third-party site, whether by means of Boingo Wi-Finder, manually searching for an available third party network or otherwise, and before providing any information to any third party, you should inform yourself of the privacy policies and practices (if any) of the third party, and should take those steps necessary to your discretion, to protect your privacy.

  


I hereby consent to the disclosure by Skype to Boingo of information concerning me, including my Skype ID and details of the sessions initiated on Boingo's hotspots. I understand that such disclosure may entail the transfer of personal data outside of the European Union or assimilated countries. I acknowledge and agree that my usage of Boingo’s hotspots shall constitute consent to such disclosure and transfer.

  


Because of changes in technology and the growth and development of our business, or for other business reasons, we may need to modify this privacy policy from time to time. We will alert you by email if this privacy policy is revised (if you have given us your email address), and we will post a copy of the new policy with its effective date on this Site. It is therefore important that you register with us and notify us if you change your email address. If you do not provide us with a current email address, you should regularly review this policy to ensure that you are informed of any changes.

  


This privacy policy is effective as of March 22, 2011. Boingo reserves the right to change this policy at any time. By using the Boingo service, you are acknowledging and accepting all terms and conditions outlined in this Boingo Wireless, Inc. privacy policy.

If you have any questions regarding this policy statement, please e-mail us at [info@boingo.com](mailto:info@boingo.com).

This privacy and security pledge is part of our contract with you. Thank you for choosing Boingo Wireless, Inc.
