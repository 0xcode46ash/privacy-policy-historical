**BORN's privacy policy  
** At BORN, we take your privacy seriously. Our basic privacy policy is simple and straightforward - we will not share any of your personally identifiable information with any third party except when compelled to do so by law (for example, in response to a subpoena). Personally identifiable information means information relating to an identified or identifiable individual. We will use any personally identifiable information submitted to us only for the stated purpose. It is always your voluntary choice whether or not to share personally identifiable information with us. 

Our web site provides visitors with the opportunity to provide personally identifiable information, such as name, postal address and e-mail address, so that you may, for example:    


We may use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to encrypt your name, address, and any other personally identifiable information you may submit to us over the Internet in certain areas of our site. Please look for the icon in your browser, usually a key or padlock, or a URL with the "https" beginning to signify when and where we are using SSL. To support this technology, you need an SSL-capable browser. 

Should you choose to submit personally identifiable information to us, you consent to our use of that information in accordance with the terms of this privacy statement. 

If you send us an e-mail either submitted directly or through a form, we may retain the content of the e-mail, your e-mail address, our response and the text of any follow-up questions you may have. 

We will never sell your personally identifiable information to any third party, and we do not compile personally identifiable information for dissemination to outside parties for marketing purposes. 

We sometimes use "cookies" - small files of information that a web site can send to your browser, which may then store the cookie on your hard drive - to personalize web content by enabling us to tailor information to suit your individual preferences during your visit or when you return to our site. Cookies may also tell us how you entered our site, how you navigated through the site, and what information was of interest to you. The cookies we use identify you only as a number and can only be read by us. 

If you are not comfortable using cookies, please remember you can disable them by changing the settings in preferences or options menu in your browser. If you do not accept cookies, you may be asked to reenter your name and e-mail address several times during your visit to our site or when you return later. 

BORN reserves the right to change this privacy statement as business needs require.
