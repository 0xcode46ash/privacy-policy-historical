We do third party advertisements on our website(bornrealist.com) to support our website.

This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (for example showing California real estate ads to someone in California) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing video game ads to someone who frequently visits video game websites).

 **DoubleClick DART cookies**

We also may use DART cookies for ad serving purposes through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing through the different websites and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising. This cookie is used to serve ads specific to only you and your interests (“interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been visiting websites about traveling abroad, you may see different hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related website, such as on a site about football). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers.

Please remember that deleting cookies does not mean that you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added.
