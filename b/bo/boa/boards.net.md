# The Boards Network Start Point Portal - Privacy Page

Your privacy is a matter of great importance to the Boards Network and [The Commerce Company](http://www.commerco.com/). 

Privacy of customer’s information and e-commerce transactions is of paramount importance to the Boards Network and [The Commerce Company](http://www.commerco.com/). Commerco is committed to protecting customer privacy and assisting its portal guests to take full advantage of Internet electronic commerce. 

To protect portal guest privacy, The Commerce Company follows several operating principles following the standards of worldwide practice for customer privacy and data protection. 

**PRINCIPLE 1 - NOTICE**  
Commerco will ask a visitor when information is needed that personally identifies an individual (Personal Information) or allows us to contact the individual. All web input forms associated with contact information requested when visitors contact Commerco, ordering e-mail newsletters or joining a limited-access premium site. Commerco uses visitor Personal Information for four primary purposes: 

To alert visitors to special offers, updated information and other new services from the Boards Network, another Commerco portal or The Commerce Company. 

**PRINCIPLE 2 - CONSENT**  
If visitors choose not to register or provide their personal information, they can still use most Commerco sites. But visitors will not be able to access areas that require registration. 

If a visitor decides to register, they will be able to select the information they want to receive from a Commerco site by subscribing to various services, like electronic newsletters. If a visitor does not want communications from Commerco or a portal regarding Commerco programs, events, or services by e-mail, postal mail, or telephone, they may visit the Commerco Visitor Information Center, and to establish preferences in the Free Newsletters and Contact Options sections. At this point our center is not available, so requests via email via the contact page regarding privacy concerns are also honored. 

Commerco occasionally allows other companies to offer its registered customers information about their products and services, using postal mail only. If visitors do not want to receive these offers, they should uncheck the Contact Options section stating, "Commerco partners can send me postal mail about their services or products." 

**PRINCIPLE 3 - ACCESS**  
Commerco will provide its visitors the means to ensure that their personal information is correct and current. They may review and update their information at any time at the Visitor Information Center. At the Visitor Information Center a visitor can:   


Register. Once visitors register, they won't need to do so again. Wherever visitors reach any Commerco site, their information stays with them. 

**PRINCIPLE 4 - SECURITY**  
Commerco strictly protects the security of its visitor’s personal information and honors their choices for intended use of that information. Commerco make best effort attempts to protect data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. 

**PRINCIPLE 5 - ENFORCEMENT**  
If for some reason a visitor believes that The Commerce Company has not adhered to these principles, [contact](http://www.boards.net/Contact/) The Commerce Company, so that a determination regarding this belief can be made and corrective action taken, if appropriate. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line of any correspondence. 

**NOTICE TO PARENTS**  
Parents or guardians: Commerco wants to help guard children's privacy (after all, Commerco does operate [Kidz.Com](http://www.kidz.com/)). Commerco encourages parents to speak with children about safe and responsible use of their Personal Information while using the Internet. Parents can find a wealth of information for children at the [Kidz.Com](http://www.kidz.com/) Internet site. 

**CUSTOMER PROFILES**  
As mentioned above, every registered visitor has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification number, which helps Commerco ensure that only that visitor can access their profile. 

When visitors register, Commerco creates their profile, assigns a personal identification number, and sends this personal identification number back to their computer in the form of a cookie, which is a very small file that resides on the computer’s hard drive. This code is unique to the computer it resides upon. It enables seamless travel across Commerco sites, allowing visitors to order free newsletters and visit premium start point portal sites without having to reenter registration form information already provided. Even if visitors switch computers, they won't need to re-register – their e-mail address and password identifies them. 

**Privacy FAQs:**  


Q: What is a cookie, and how does a cookie affect privacy?  
A: A cookie is the term first coined by Netscape to identify a file that can be passed from an Internet web server to a browser and back again. The file is tiny and allows the site to keep a limited amount of information about a visitor so as to identify them by matching the code contained in the visitor’s computer against a database on the server. 

Q: How exactly does registration information help provide better content for visitors?  
A: The Commerce Company operates approximately 200 start point portals. Each of these has many different sub sites that, in turn, are comprised of many web pages of content. Finding what visitors need among those pages should be easy. When visitors provide information about themselves, it helps to filter out sites that are not relevant to the visitor. The better Commerco understand its visitors, the more specific the information that can be provided. Commerco can offer product or information updates that help its visitors stay up to date. 

Q: When entering a form and quitting before finishing, what happens to the information already typed in?  
A: If visitors begin to enter data on a form and decide to quit, simply click a cancel button or another link on the page. None of the information entered on the page where entry stopped should be saved. However, information entered on previous pages or as the consequence of error reporting, will be saved in a database. 

Q: Can this privacy policy be modified?  
A: This Privacy Policy can only be modified by The Commerce Company. Such modifications may occur from time to time, with notice being posted on this page. It is the portal guest's option as to whether to continue their relationship with this portal at that time. 

Q: If The Commerce Company sells a portal or the company itself is sold or no longer exists, what happens to my data?  
A: In order for any new owner of either an individual former Commerco portal or The Commerce Company to continue to service the needs of portal guests, the information supplied by them should transfer to the new owner under the existing terms and conditions. At that time, should the new owner have new terms and conditions, they should communicate that the terms have changed and request that site guests approve the changes. 

Q: What is The Mutual Customer Network?  
A: The Mutual Customer Network is being developed to offer portal guest more flexibility and a more integrated Internet experience in their travels through Commerco start point portals. The idea is to offer a single point of data entry to allow guests to be known at all Commerco portals. 

Q: Will other companies be a part of The Mutual Customer Network?  
A: Eventually, Commerco may make this service available to other companies to ensure the correctness of mutual customer's data. This sharing of data may only take place via authorization by the Commerco portal guest only.
