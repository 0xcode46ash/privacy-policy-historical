# boats.com - Privacy

The following privacy statement describes the practice of boats.com with respect to the collection, maintenance and disclosure of information. If you have any questions about this privacy statement, please contact [customersupport@boats.com](mailto:customersupport@boats.com) for more information.   
---  
   
**General**  
Boats.com is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from those described in this statement. Boats.com collects information from users at several different points on this site as discussed below.   
   
**Registration**  
Boats.com offers its services to non-professional individuals who want either to sell or buy a boat, as well as to professional individuals and dealers. While the general practice of collection, maintaining and sharing of personal information collected from buyers, sellers or dealers is the same, there are some differences in the type of information that is collected. The following explains what type of information is collected from buyers and sellers.   
   
**Seller and Buyer Registration**  
To view certain areas of the boats.com site and to use services provided by boats.com, a user must first register by completing the registration form. During registration a user is required to provide contact information (such as email address). This information is used to inform the user of the services on the boats.com site for which the user expressed an interest. The provision of the personal information (such as name and address) requested by the registration form is optional. The registration form contains a request for non-personal information such as users' boating interests. This information is also optional but users are encouraged to provide this type of information to facilitate a more personalized experience on boats.com. 

In addition to the above, the seller has to provide detailed information about the boat, billing information and detailed contact information. The detailed boat information will be posted on the site once it has gone through the verification process and been approved. The billing information will be used to bill seller on a monthly basis for the service provided such as listing a boat on the boats.com. The contact information for the seller will be provided to registered users interested in purchasing the boat.   
  
**Correction/Updating Personal Information**  
If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as e-mail), or if a user no longer desires our service, we have provided a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. Data can be updated or changed at the "My Account" page on the site. In order to remove personal data from our site (i.e. cancel your account), you must contact a Customer Service representative at [customersupport@boats.com](mailto:customersupport@boats.com).   
   
**Community**  
In order to post reviews and ratings a user must be a registered user of boats.com. We recommend that a user enter a complete user profile to build community and accountability. This information will be used only for product reviews and will not be distributed. The user profile information is different and separate from the registered user information, which we do share. 

Any information that is posted by a user is considered public information. Exercise caution when you decide to disclose personal information in forum sessions as all users of the site will have access to this information.   
  
   
**Sharing**  
Boats.com will share information with both our partners and affiliates. The type of information shared will be different for each. Partners and affiliates will have different uses for the data that is delivered to them. Affiliates will be given qualified leads for direct sales where partners will be given non-personal aggregated information. We may disclose personal information if required by law or enforcement officers or in order to protect boats.com or its users.   
   
**Partners**  
We share non-personal aggregated registration information with our partners. The information shared is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual person. This information will be analyzed to improve services and offerings on both our site as well as our partners' sites. Our partners will not use this information to contact the user on their own behalf.

We use an outside company for credit card processing to bill dealers for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.   
  
   
**Affiliates**  
We will share referral information with affiliate members of boats.com. An affiliate member is an OEM that has signed a contract with boats.com and has qualified to receive leads from boats.com. We will only share information with manufacturers about users who request information about their specific products. We will not provide the affiliates with information about users who request information about other products with which the affiliate is not affiliated. This can be opted in or out of during user registration.   
   
**Choice/Opt-out**  
Users are given the opportunity to "opt-out" of having their information used for purposes not directly related to our site at the point where we ask for the information. Our registration form has an "opt-out" mechanism so users who do not want newsletters or any promotional information from our partners or us can keep their email address off of our lists.   
   
**Security**  
Boats.com takes every precaution to protect its users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the web site at boats.com's request, such information is protected both online and offline. 

When our registration/listing form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked. 

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything reasonably in our power to protect user-information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted to authorized users. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific task (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment. 

If you have any questions about the security at the boats.com site, you can send an email to [customersupport@boats.com](mailto:customersupport@boats.com).  
  
**Special Offers**  
We send all new members a welcoming email to verify that the account has been set up. Established members will occasionally receive information on products, services, special deals, and a newsletter. Out of respect for the privacy of our users we present the option to not receive these types of communications. Please see our choice and opt-out above.   
   
**Newsletter**  
Both registered and non-registered users can sign up for newsletters from boats.com. In order to receive a newsletter, an email address must be submitted to boats.com. Both registered and non-registered users can unsubscribe by using the unsubscribe link supplied in the newsletter, or select the unsubscribe button on the site's Newsletter page or in My Account. You can also email us at [customersupport@boats.com ](mailto:customersupport@boats.com).   
   
**Surveys & Contests**  
From time to time our site requests information from users via surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has an option whether to provide the information requested. Information requested may include contact information and demographic information. Contact information will be used to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of the boats.com site.   
   
**Site and Service Updates**  
We also send users site and service announcement updates. Registered users are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services relating to their account via email or phone.   
   
   
**Links to Other Websites**  
Boats.com contains links to other sites. Please be aware that boats.com is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage users to be alert when they leave boats.com and to review the privacy statements of each and every web site that they visit before disclosing personal information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected on the boats.com site.   
   
**Notification of Changes**  
If we decide to make changes to this privacy statement, we will post a link to these changes on our home page so that the users are always aware of our current information collection, maintenance and disclosure practice. If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have an option whether to let us use their information in a different manner.   
   
**Cookies**  
Boats.com uses "cookies" which are small text files that are stored on the user's computer and gather and keep track of information related to the user. Cookies can store the user's preferences through a password the user selects to access the boats.com site. Although many web site browsers are set to accept cookies, a user can set his/her web site browser to reject cookies, but this may prevent the user from using some of the convenience features of the boats.com site. Non-personal information collected through cookies is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information.   
   
**Log Files**  
We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.   
   
**Children's Use of boats.com**  
We do not knowingly acknowledge or accept orders, registrations or requests for any goods or services from persons under age of 13. If it comes to our attention that a request has come from a person under age of 13, we will not respond to such a request. Instead we will automatically delete any information provided by a person who acknowledges being under 13 years old.

For the protection and privacy of children, we discourage unsupervised persons under the age of 13 from posting messages to any forum on boats.com.
