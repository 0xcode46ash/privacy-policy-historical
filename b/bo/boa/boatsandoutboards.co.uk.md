# BoatsAndOutboards: Help System

##### Our Commitment To Privacy

Boatsandoutboards make every attempt to keep any personal data you supply as safe and secure as possible. We are registered under the Data Protection Act in the UK. We do not supply your personal details to any marketing organisations under any circumstances whatsoever. We will attempt to stop any phone numbers provided with your advert from appearing on our web site but due to technical reasons this cannot be guaranteed in all cases, eg, for non UK phone numbers, personal Numbers etc. Your phone numbers may appear in printed form in a magazine along with your advert details, as a classified advert, so that people can make direct contact with you. We make every attempt to ensure that your email address does not appear on the website nor in printed form. We have security measures to prevent unauthorised access to the limited information you provide. We do not use cookies or track your patterns of behaviour. We do not ask for any credit card or similar details as our private adverts are for free. 

##### Email Opt-out Procedures

All boatsandoutboards emails, with the exception of those which are required as a result of you placing an advert can be opted-out of. Opt-out instructions are included in the email. You may also contact us at any time to opt-out. 

##### How We Use Information

When you supply information to us it is used in the following manner.   
We need to know your email address and/or your phone number (although it is not our policy to display them on the internet) so that third parties can make contact with you through us. If you opt-in to receive information on marine events or marine offers we will periodically send you emails on them. Your marine items need to be described in text so that people know what you are selling and we are pleased to display pictures with your text (you must make sure you have a right to use the pictures you send or you could be in breach of copyright). We also ask for your postal address for security reasons although it is not madatory. Your postal address is only used as a security / anti-fraud measure.
