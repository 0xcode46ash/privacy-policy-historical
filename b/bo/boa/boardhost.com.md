# Boardhost: Privacy Policy

| **BOARDHOST.COM, INC. PRIVACY POLICY**  
---  
Last Revised March 18, 2009  
  
Boardhost.com, Inc. is a provider of customizable, interactive message boards, which are created and maintained by customers of our service. This document describes our policies regarding privacy, and the privacy expectations that you may have when using our customers' message boards, or when corresponding with us. 

**MESSAGE POSTINGS**

Any information that is revealed in a posting to a message board provided through our service becomes public information. Should you choose to include your e-mail address or other contact information in a posting, you may be subject to unsolicited correspondence from other viewers of your post. You should exercise caution when deciding to disclose any personal information. 

To control abuse, your IP address may appear on the top of any posting you make to a Boardhost message board. In addition, after any posting, your IP address, as well as your user-agent string, which ordinarily includes such information as your computer's operating system and the type and version of your web browser, is available to the owner of the message board you have posted at. Your IP address will also be revealed to the owner of a board if their board requires registration and you register for access. Any other information you disclose when registering will also be revealed to said message board owner. Boardhost makes no representations or warranties regarding the privacy practices of message board owners, or the privacy of such information that is revealed to message board owners. 

Boardhost may also preserve IP address and user-agent string information related to any message posting, and may reveal such information to governmental agencies, courts, or other third-parties if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have or may have committed illegal activities, violated our [Usage Terms](http://www.boardhost.com/terms/tou.html), violated the rights of third-parties, impaired in any respect the ability of Boardhost to operate our service properly, or endangered in any respect Boardhost or third-parties, or in the event that the information is subpoenaed or subject to other judicial or administrative process. 

**BOARDHOST CUSTOMERS**

Personal information submitted to us by customers of our service (i.e. those who maintain a message board of their own), such as contact and/or billing information, will ordinarily not be revealed to third-parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion necessary to provide our service; however, we may preserve content and membership information and may release any or all preserved content or membership information to governmental agencies, courts, or other third-parties if we believe, in our sole discretion, that you have or may have committed illegal activities, violated our [Terms of Service](http://www.boardhost.com/terms/), violated the rights of third-parties, impaired in any respect the ability of Boardhost to operate our service properly, or endangered in any respect Boardhost or third-parties, or in the event that the information is subpoenaed or subject to other judicial or administrative process. 

**CORRESPONDENCE WITH BOARDHOST**

Any correspondence we receive from third-parties regarding a customer of our service's account may be revealed to that customer, or to other third-parties at our sole discretion (even if the third-party contacting us is also a Boardhost customer). For instance, if we receive a complaint regarding a message that appears on a customer's board, we may reveal that complaint to the message board's owner, so that they may address the situation. 

Correspondence received from customers of our service (who identify themselves as such) regarding their own message board will ordinarily not be revealed to third parties, except as we deem in our sole discretion, necessary for us to address any issues raised in or by such correspondence, or as required by law.
