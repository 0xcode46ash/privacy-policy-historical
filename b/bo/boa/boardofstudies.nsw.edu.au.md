## 1\. Introduction

The _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998_ , ( _the Act_ ) provides the people of NSW with enforceable rights in relation to the ways in which public sector agencies collect, store, use and disclose personal information. The Office of the Board of Studies is committed to complying with _the Act._ Accordingly, all personal information collected now or in the future will be administered in accordance with _the Act_.

The purpose of this management plan is to 

  * Identify personal information collected by the Office of the Board of Studies, and
  * Identify the policies and strategies that the Office of the Board of Studies will use to ensure compliance with _the Act_



### 1.1 Context and role

**The Board of Studies** is a statutory body established under the Education Act 1990. The Board has responsibilities relating to both primary and secondary education. The Board develops curriculum for all schools from Kindergarten to Year 12, develops and conducts examinations leading to the award of the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate and advises the Minister for Education and Training on applications from non Government schools seeking to operate in New South Wales.

The **Office of the Board of Studies** is a department established under the Public Sector Management Act 1988 to provide professional and operational support to the Board of Studies. **** The Office also encompasses the Australian Music Examinations Board (AMEB) and the Aboriginal Education Consultative Group (AECG) and administers the home schooling program under delegation from the Minister for Education and Training.

## 2\. The Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act

### 2.1 Personal Information

_The Act_ defines personal information as:

_

Information or an opinion (including information or an opinion forming part of a database and whether or not recorded in a material form) about an individual whose identity is apparent or can reasonably be ascertained from the information or opinion (Section 4).

_

Personal information does not include:

  * Information contained in a publicly available publication 
  * Information about an individual’s suitability for public sector employment 
  * Information about people who have been dead for more than 30 years 
  * A number of exceptions relating to law enforcement investigations 



Personal information held by the Office of the Board of Studies includes:

  * Employee data.
  * Student data, in relation to candidates for the School Certificate and Higher School Certificate examinations;
  * Teaching personnel employed by registered non-government schools;
  * Applicants for home schooling; and
  * Administrative records.



### 2.2  Information Protection Principles (IPPs)

The Information Protection Principles are 12 general principles that are set out in sections 8 and 9 of _the Act._ They set the privacy standards which the Office of the Board of Studies and all other public sector agencies are expected to follow when dealing with personal information.

The information protection principles establish standards for collecting and dealing with personal information so as to minimise the risk of misuse of that information. The principles also allow individuals to exercise a reasonable degree of control over what happens to their own personal information.

The Information Protection Principles and their intent are as follows

**

Principle 1 (s. 8)  Collection of personal information for lawful purposes

**

This principle makes it clear that all personal information must be collected for purposes which are not only lawful, but which also directly relate to a function or activity of the Office.

**

Principle 2 (s. 9) Collection of personal information directly from the individual

**

This principle is designed to limit the collection of personal information where the individual concerned is not aware that this is occurring.

**

Principle 3 (s. 10) Requirements when collecting personal information

**

This principle aims to ensure that when people are asked to provide their personal information to a public sector agency they are given enough information in order to exercise any rights that they may have under _the Act_.

**

Principle 4 (s. 11) Other requirements relating to collection of personal information

**

The Office must take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information collected from an individual is accurate and that the way it is collected does not unreasonably intrude on the personal affairs of the individual to whom it relates. 

**

Principle 5 (s. 12) Retention and security of personal information

**

This principle sets out standards for the storage of personal information once it has been collected, including the need to comply with the provisions of the _State Records Act 1998_ , and in particular the disposal of records. The Office’s legal or administrative accountability when deciding whether to dispose of personal information must also be considered.

The level of security that may be appropriate very much depends on the nature of the personal information and the medium in which it is stored.

Section 12 places an obligation on agencies which transfer personal information to outside parties to ensure that this information is not used or disclosed inappropriately. This section will generally apply where an agency transfers personal information to an outside person or organisation for the performance of a service to the agency.

The idea behind this principle is that a person who has dealings with an agency should not lose their protection under _the Act_ simply because their personal information is held by an organisation acting in a contractual or agency capacity to the public sector agency.

**

Principle 6 (s. 13) Information about personal information held by agencies

**

This principle is designed to alert people to the fact that an agency holds personal information. It also allows people to find out if any of the personal information held by the agency relates to them. It is an important principle in that people can properly exercise their rights under _the Act_ only when they know which agencies hold their personal information.

**

Principle 7 (s. 14) Access to personal information held by agencies

**

This principle allows people a right of access to their personal information which may be held by public sector agencies. While the section appears to be quite straightforward it is complicated by its interaction with the _Freedom of Information Act_. Section 20(5) states that those provisions of the _Freedom of Information Act 1989_ which impose conditions or limitations on the provision of information are imported into the _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act._

**

Principle 8 (s. 15) Alteration of personal information

**

Section 15 builds upon section 14 and provides a right to either amend or to attach a statement to personal information which a person believes to be incorrect or inappropriate.

Generally agencies cannot delete information contained within their records systems due to the operation of the _State Records Act 1998_. Section 15 of the _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act_ allows an agency to delete information from their records system in some cases.

Section 15 is in part designed to give the subject of the data some control over personal information that may be held about them. In this regard s. 15(2) offers a person the right to have their say on the face of the record. 

**

Principle 9 (s. 16) Agency must check accuracy of personal information before use

**

Section 16 places an obligation on agencies to try to ensure that all personal information used by them is relevant and accurate.

Where an agency relies on information collected by other agencies to make decisions, s. 16 would require that adequate standards for data exchange be introduced to ensure that the information means the same thing in both agencies.

**

Principle 10 (s. 17) Limits on use of personal information

**

This principle places limits on the uses an agency can make of any personal information that it collects or holds. It generally restricts use to the purpose for which the information was collected unless consent is obtained for other uses.

Agencies that breach the information protection principles are subject to internal review under _the Act_. Thus, if an agency plans to use personal information for a purpose not directly related to the purpose for collection it will not only need to obtain consent from the person to whom the information relates, it will also need evidence of that consent to protect itself from future action.

**

Principle 11 (s. 18) Limits on disclosure of personal information

**

This principle makes a general rule that personal information should be disclosed only for purposes directly related to the purposes for which the information was collected. This general rule then has a number of exceptions contained within the principle.

A directly related purpose is a purpose that is very closely related to the purpose for collection. This would be the type of situation that people would quite reasonably expect to occur with their personal information.

**

Principle 12 (s. 19) Special restrictions on disclosure of personal information

**

There are two distinct parts to s. 19. The first part deals with a number of categories of sensitive information, which are subject to more stringent disclosure requirements than those that apply to other kinds of personal information under s. 18.

The first part combines a recognition that these kinds of information cover areas of personal life which are not usually appropriate matters of official interest together with a concern that their disclosure could result in uses which are prejudicial to the individuals concerned.

The second part of s. 19 places restrictions on disclosure of personal information to persons or bodies outside New South Wales.

**

### 2.3  Privacy Codes of Practice

**

If a public sector agency believes that the information protection principles are unworkable in a particular circumstance, it can either make a Privacy Code of Practice or seek an exemption from, or modification to, the principle from the Privacy Commissioner.

Privacy Codes of Practice allow an agency to modify one or more of the information protection principles. Codes of Practice can be made in relation to one of three things:

  * A particular type of personal information (s. 29(5)(a))
  * A particular organisation or type of organisation (s. 29(5)(b))
  * For a type of activity (s. 29(5)(c))



A Privacy Code of Practice can change or delete any of the information protection principles but it cannot change or delete any of the exceptions to the principles, nor can it increase the level of privacy protection above that of the information protection principles.

### 2.4  Other legal requirements affecting privacy

In developing the Office’s response to its obligations under the _Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998_ consideration has been given to the requirements of the following sections of the _Education Act 1990_ and the _Education Regulation 1996_ in so far as the treatment of personal information is concerned:

The Education Act 1990 at section 18 A and 102, inter alia, states 

**

S. 18A Publication of Results of certain tests: 

**

The Regulations may make provision for or with respect to the extent to which the results of:

  * School Certificate and Higher School Certificate examinations or other assessments, may be publicly revealed or must be kept confidential. 



**

S.102 (Education Act 1990) Functions of the Board 

**

  * to prepare and distribute to schools information relating to the courses of study for candidates for the recognised certificates, and information relating to eligibility to be granted those certificates; 
  * to make such arrangements as may be necessary for the conduct of examinations or other forms of assessment for candidates for the recognised certificates and to regulate the conduct of those examinations or other forms of assessment and the recording of candidates’ achievements in them; 
  * to prepare and distribute to schools information relating to the conduct of examinations and other forms of assessment for candidates for the recognised certificates; 
  * (v)special arrangements for students with disabilities, including the approval of special courses of study, the modification of requirements for the grant of the recognised certificates and the grant of special records of achievement; 



The Education Regulation 1996 at clause 5, inter alia, states

**

5 Publication of results: section 18A

**

  1. This clause applies to the following results:
  2. results of School Certificate and Higher School Certificate examinations and related assessments,
  3. Results to which this clause applies must not be publicly revealed if the results relating to particular students are revealed.
  4. Results relating to a particular student may however be revealed as follows:
  5. to the student or to anyone with the student’s consent,
  6. to the student’s parents,
  7. to the principal of a school at which the student is enrolled or at which the student was previously enrolled,
  8. in the case of results of School Certificate or Higher School Certificate examinations and related assessments-by or with the approval of the Board of Studies, by way of the publication of the results of students who the Board considers have achieved outstanding results.
