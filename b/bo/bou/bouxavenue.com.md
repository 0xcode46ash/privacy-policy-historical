# Privacy and security | Boux Avenue

## Privacy & security

At Boux Avenue we absolutely recognise how important it is to keep your personal information safe and secure.

We take your personal privacy very seriously and are committed to ensuring that your details are kept confidential. When you kindly provide us with your name, address, credit card, contact details or any other personal details we promise to keep them safe and secure and will not share them with anyone outside Boux Avenue Limited.

 **Shopping with Boux Avenue is guaranteed to be safe, secure and of course, stylish.**

## Site security

The Bouxavenue.com website is totally secure

Our website uses 128 bit SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption technology which is the most advanced level of security currently available for online shopping.

When you are in a secure area of the website, such as the checkout, you should see a solid padlock in your browser status bar which indicates that the encryption is taking place, and therefore safe to continue.

You will also see that the Boux Avenue address in the browser has changed and the http has been replaced with https in front of the www.bouxavenue.com address — another sure sign of tip top security.

## Privacy promise

We take your personal privacy very seriously and are committed to ensuring that your details are kept confidential and are only used to provide you with our fabulous customer service.

We promise that: 

  * We will never sell your personal details to any outside company 
  * Unless specifically authorised by you, we will not pass on your details to any third party company for mailing or marketing purposes 



When you shop on the Boux Avenue website we collect some personal information from you. All this information is held on secure servers and Boux Avenue fully complies with all obligations required of the data protection act and current consumer legislation.

Some of this information is used to process your order and to keep you informed of its progress. We use some third party institutions to handle the processing and fulfillment of your order. They receive the information needed to do this and all such institutions are under strict contractual obligations to keep your personal information secure and private, so no need to worry.

For more details on our Privacy Policy, please see the section incorporated into our [terms and conditions](http://www.bouxavenue.com/terms-and-conditions) of use.

## Phishing emails or calls — do not share your personal information

Phishing is the process of tricking someone into passing over personal or sensitive information. This can be done in an email format or through a phone call from someone pretending to be from an official and legitimate source.

Do not share your personal information with anyone claiming to be from Boux Avenue. If we need to take an alternative payment method or other personal information from you, we will ask you to call us back on our main customer services number.

If you think someone is attempting to deceive you into passing over your details, please let one of our customer service team know immediately by giving us a call on 0800 054 6550 (Monday-Sunday 8am-8pm), or email us at [hello@bouxavenue.com](mailto:hello@bouxavenue.com).
