# Privacy and cookies | Boux Avenue

  


## Privacy & Cookies

We use cookies on bouxavenue.com to enable various types of functionality (including buying online, saving your size preferences and signing in to your account). These help us to better understand how people use our website so that we can work on offering you the best possible experience. Website usage statistics are always anonymous, a cookie can be read only by the website that sets it and cookies cannot contain viruses or access any personal information on your computer.

Read on for further information about the cookies we may use, how to manage cookies on your computer or mobile device and our privacy policy.

## What are cookies?

Cookies are tiny text files stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages. If your web browser settings allow it, any website may set its own cookies on your computer, but to protect your privacy your browser will only let a website read a cookie that it has set. A cookie will usually contain the domain of the website that has set it (e.g. bouxavenue.com, google.co.uk, bbc.co.uk etc.), the ‘lifetime’ of the cookie (how long it will be stored for), and the cookie’s value which is often a randomly generated unique string of letters and/or numbers. Because cookies are just text files, they cannot contain viruses or be used to access any personal information on your computer.

## First-party and third-party cookies

A first-party cookie is one that is set by the website you are visiting, whereas a third-party cookie is one that is set by a website that may be providing content to the website you are visiting (for example, if you watch an embedded YouTube video on a website you are visiting, you may find that YouTube sets its own cookie). Remember that a website can only read its own cookies, so any third party websites cannot read the cookies set by the website you are visiting. Equally, the website you are visiting cannot read any cookies set by third party websites.

## How does bouxavenue.com use cookies?

We use cookies on bouxavenue.com to enable various types of functionality and to better understand how people use our website. This enables us to offer you the best possible experience:

### First-party cookies

These cookies are set by bouxavenue.com and can be read only by bouxavenue.com.

Cookie name(s)| Purpose  
---|---  
ASP.NET_SessionId| This cookie allows our web servers to respond to your actions on the website such as "Add to bag" or browsing the website. Without it, the website wouldn’t know if one person or lots of different people were clicking through pages of the site meaning no one would be able to login or buy anything.  
PHPSESSID| This cookie is very similar to ASP.NET_SessionId cookie above but is set if you browse certain pages on bouxavenue.com that are powered by Wordpress (e.g. Miss B’s blog).  
size| This cookie is used to remember your size preferences. When you choose your size to add an item to your bag or when you save your size preferences in your VIP account, the sizes are saved in the cookie. The website then pre-selects your size when you view other products so you don’t have to keep doing it.   
viewedproducts| This cookie is used to show you your recently viewed items when you’re browsing our range so it’s easier for you to get back to something you’ve already looked at. You can always use the cross on each item (or the clear all button) to hide these.  
Login| This cookie is set only if you select ‘Keep me signed in’ when you sign in to your VIP account. The cookie stores your VIP account email address and a securely encrypted version of your password (i.e. if anyone did get hold of your computer and found this cookie, they would not be able to get your password). To keep your account secure, you should never select ‘Keep me signed in’ on a public or shared computer.  
__utma, __utmb, __utmc, __utmz| These cookies are set by a website analytics package we use called Google Analytics. Any data passed to the Google Analytics platform is anonymous and used by us to understand trends in visitor behaviour. This helps us make better decisions about our marketing activity and website.  
_#env, _#sess, _#srchist, _#uid, _#vdf, _#slid, _#clickid, _#lps, _#tsa| These cookies are set by a website analytics package we use called DC Storm. Any data passed to the DC Storm platform is anonymous and used by us to understand trends in visitor behaviour. This helps us make better decisions about our marketing activity.  
Cookies beginning with comment_author, comment_author_email, comment_author_url| These cookies are set by our Wordpress blogging platform when you leave a comment on Miss B’s blog. This is for your convenience so that you won’t have to retype your information again when you want to leave another comment.  
_aw_m_3454| This cookie is set only if you visit bouxavenue.com via one of our affiliate partners. It lets us identify when we need to pay commission on sales.  
  


### Third-party cookies

We will endeavour to keep the below list updated, however it may become out of date if the third parties alter the cookies they use.

Cookie set by| Cookie name(s)| Purpose  
---|---|---  
awin1.com (Affiliate Window)| aw3454| Boux Avenue works with a number of affiliate websites on a commission basis to attract a wider audience than we otherwise might. This cookie is set only if you visit bouxavenue.com via one of these affiliate websites (or their email/social activity). It is used to record that the affiliate sent us a visitor so that we can identify when we need to pay commission on sales.  
www.googleadservices.com (Google)| Conversion| This cookie is set only if you visit bouxavenue.com via an advert or sponsored link on Google’s search results. If you decide to buy something, this cookie is used to tell our Google AdWords advertising account that the click on the advert resulted in a sale. This helps us make better decisions about our marketing activity and display more relevant adverts.  
Facebook| c_user, datr, locale, lu, s, xs| If you choose to use the Facebook ‘like’ or ‘share’ buttons that can be found on some pages of bouxavenue.com, Facebook may set some or all of these cookies.  
Twitter| k, guest_id, _twitter_sess, original_referer, external_referer| If you choose to use the Twitter ‘tweet’ button that can be found on some pages of bouxavenue.com, Twitter may set some or all of these cookies.  
PayPal| s_vi, DH4puLeRqX6BpunfdurQO8Swi28, HaC80bwXscjqZ7KM6VOxULOB534, INSIDE_SEARCH_PARAMS, KHcl0EuY7AKSMgfvHl7J5E7hPtK, LANG, PUuuwWB0yFt3AzV9ACftsAxz2fO, SEGM, cookie_check, cwrClyrK4LoCV1fydGbAxiNL6iG, flow_back_cookie, login_email, navcmd, navlns, pNTcMTtQfrJuaJiwEnWXQ6yNxfq, s_pers, s_sess, Apache, TS6a0e62| If you choose to pay for your order using PayPal, you will be temporarily redirected to the PayPal website to login and confirm the payment. The PayPal website may set some or all of these cookies. As a PayPal user, you are advised to read PayPal’s cookie policy to understand where PayPal and/or its third- party partners may be setting additional cookies.  
  


## How to manage cookies on your computer or mobile device

If cookies aren't enabled on your computer you will still be able to browse www.bouxavenue.com and blog.bouxavenue.com, but your experience will be limited and you will not be able to add items to your bag and buy them.

Using your web browser’s settings you can view the cookies on your computer, remove all or some cookies and set rules on when to allow and not allow cookies to be set. For instructions on how to manage cookies in your particular web browser we recommend you visit [www.aboutcookies.org](http://www.aboutcookies.org/) (opens in a new window – please note that we cannot be held responsible for the content of external websites).

If you would like to know how to manage the cookies on your mobile phone, tablet or other mobile device we recommend that you check your device’s manual.
