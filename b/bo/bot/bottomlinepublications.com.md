**Effective: June, 2011**

Thank you for visiting Boardroom.com, BottomLineStores.com, BottomLinePublications.com, BottomLinePubs.com, HighEnergyForLife.com, BottomLineSecrets.com plus any other domains which may be adopted by Boardroom and/or product-based domain names used occasionally for promotional purposes by Boardroom, Inc. (the " Web Sites").

This Policy explains what information Boardroom Inc. ("Boardroom" or "we") collects on the Web Sites and how such information is used. By visiting any of the Web Sites, you signify your acceptance of this Policy.

Because the Web is an evolving medium, Boardroom reserves the right to change the terms of this Policy at any time and to add other sites to the Boardroom family of Web Sites. Any changes will become effective as soon as we publish notice of them. We may publish notice by any reasonable means, including by E-mail or by posting notice on our Web sites. By continuing to use any of the Sites after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.

Your privacy is important to us. We are committed to providing our valuable customers with the best and most useful information available anywhere and protecting our customers' privacy. We are committed to the ethical and fair use of the information we collect

We record certain information about visitors to our Web sites for the purpose of making our Web sites more informative and useful to our customers.

We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to us online while using the Site(s) (e.g., while on the Site(s) or in responding via email to a feature provided on the Site(s)). Boardroom only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do so or in the event that they have signed up to receive our free newsletters or have purchased one of our products. Boardroom collects personally identifying information from our users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information includes name and e-mail address for registration to receive our free newsletters and name, postal address, and credit card information when purchasing our products. All of this information is provided to us by you.

We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate online through the Site(s). For example, we may collect information about your computer's connection to the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our web pages to you and to measure traffic on the Site(s). We also may use a standard feature found in browser software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site(s). Cookies are small files that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By showing how and when visitors use the Site(s), cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how many unique users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from having to re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site(s) where you may have entered preference information before. The Site(s) also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files also known as "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site(s) or open HTML-formatted email messages.

We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site(s) in a variety of ways, including using the information to customize features and advertising that appear on the Site(s). We also may provide your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors, and advertisers, for a variety of purposes. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we reserve the right to use, and to disclose to third parties, all of the information collected from and about you while you are using the Site(s) in any way and for any purpose, such as to enable us or a third party to provide you with information about products and services. If you do not wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the Online Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy requesting to be taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may be given or sold to third-parties.

**The information we collect from our Web Site(s)(s)s is limited to:**

> 1\. Use of E-mail addresses of those who communicate with us by E-mail. Our server does not collect your E-mail address unless you specifically provide it to us or communicate with us via E-mail. We will use your E-mail address to respond to your inquiries or to send you our free E-mail letters and E-promotions, if you request them. We may also use your E-mail address to correspond with you about your account or to send you information about Boardroom, and other Boardroom Web Sites and publications. We do not make your E-mail address available to other organizations for commercial purposes unless we have your consent to do so, or as otherwise described in this Policy.
> 
> 2\. Counts and trends regarding what pages people look at on our Web Site(s)(s)s. Example: We can determine which pages on our Web Site(s)(s)s are visited most often, and which operating systems (such as Windows® or Macintosh® OS) and Web browsers (such as Safari® or Internet Explorer® ) are the most popular. None of this information identifies you personally. We use the information in the aggregate only to improve our Web Site(s)(s)s and make them more informative.
> 
> 3\. Information volunteered by Site(s)(s) visitors. We collect personal information about our customers on customer service forms, subscription forms, surveys, contests and promotions. Our agents and vendors, such as database architects and E-mail broadcasters, who have access to our customers' personally identifying information, are instructed to only use this information in connection with the work they are doing for Boardroom and for no other purpose. Boardroom may disclose information by or about visitors to the Web Site(s)(s)s in order to (1) comply with applicable laws, (2) respond to governmental inquiries, (3) comply with valid legal process, and (4) protect the rights or property of Boardroom. 

Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information available for viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, web logs, through email, in comments to posts, or in chat areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us. We cannot be responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.

Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising on the Site(s) also may collect information from you via cookies, web beacons or similar technologies. These third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help present their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements' effectiveness, or for other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party advertisers and ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is not covered by our Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad servers may be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of cookies or web beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party's website and review its privacy policy.

As a convenience, Boardroom may provide links on the Web Site(s)s to third-party Web Site(s)s that provide access to products and services offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access another webSite(s) or purchase third-party products or services through the Site(s), use of any information you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are visiting or the provider of such products or services.

We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site(s) through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where the brands of our provider partner appear on the Site(s) in connection with such content, products and/or services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or that is collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in cooperation with our provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from you directly, in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider partner's use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from ours. If you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners, you should contact the provider partner directly for more information. Boardroom shall have no responsibility or liability for the data collection and use practices of those sites.

Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release is appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users of the Site(s) or the public.
