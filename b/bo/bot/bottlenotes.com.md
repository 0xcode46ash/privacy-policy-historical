### Introduction

Bottlenotes, Inc. ("Bottlenotes," "we" or "us") owns and operates [www.bottlenotes.com](http://www.bottlenotes.com/ "www.bottlenotes.com") , [www.winecyclopedia.com](http://www.winecyclopedia.com/ "www.winecyclopedia.com"), and other web sites that are co-sponsored by Bottlenotes and other third parties ("Co-Sponsored Sites") (collectively, the "Sites").  
This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by us through the Sites and does not apply to information obtained or collected by us in any other manner unless expressly stated in this Privacy Policy. Please take a minute to read this Privacy Policy so that you understand our information collection practices, such as the types of information we collect from visitors to the Sites ("Visitors") and how we may use that information. Please also review our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/terms-of-service), which governs your use of the Sites.  
   


### Active Collection of Personal Information

To access or take advantage of certain features of the Sites, we may request that you provide personal information. "Personal Information" is information about you that is associated with your name or identity, such as, name, mailing address, e-mail address, credit or debit card account number, birth date, telephone number, or purchase information. Personal Information may also include "Demographic Information," such as your gender, marital status, salary, purchasing habits, or similar information.  
Personal Information may be requested and collected at various locations and on various forms on the Sites, including but not limited to: registration forms for newsletters and other e-mail communications; registration for membership to the Sites; registration for participation in contests, sweepstakes, auctions, surveys or other promotions that may be offered on the Sites (collectively, "Promotions"); when you submit an inquiry via the Sites; when you submit an order for wine or other products; or when you communicate or otherwise interact with us via the Sites. You may always elect not to submit Personal Information, however, as a result, you may not be able to access certain of the Sites' features and functionality.  
We may also provide you opportunities to submit Personal Information about other individuals. For instance, you may choose to send a notice through the Sites to a friend regarding content offered by the Sites. We will not use the Personal Information of these individuals for any other purpose unless we disclose otherwise at the time you provide the information.  
If you have registered as a member of any of the Sites, you may update or modify some of the information that you actively provided through the Sites, including your e-mail marketing preferences, by logging into your member account. In addition, you may deactivate your member account.  
   


### Passive Collection of Information

In addition to the Personal Information that you actively provide to us, we or our third party service providers may use a variety of technologies to automatically collect information about you when you use the Sites. This information may include Demographic Information, browser type, operating system, clickstream data, IP address, mobile device identifiers and other information.  
The methods that we and our service providers may use to automatically collect such information include the following:  
  **Cookies** : Cookies are data files that are placed on a computer when it is used to visit a web site. These cookies may be used for many purposes, including, without limitation, tracking user preferences and web pages visited while using the Sites. You may disable cookies using your browser's preferences. However, some features of the Sites may not function properly or may operate slowly if you disable the cookies.  
  **Web Beacons** : We may include small graphic images called web beacons, also known as "Internet tags" or "clear gifs," in our web pages and e-mail messages. Web beacons may be invisible to you, but any electronic image inserted into a web page or e-mail can act as a web beacon. We may use web beacons or similar technologies for a number of purposes, including, without limitation, to count the number of visitors to the Sites, to monitor how users navigate the Sites, to count how many e-mails that we sent were actually opened or to count how many particular articles or links were actually viewed.  
  **Embedded Scripts:** An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Sites. It is temporarily downloaded onto your computer from our web server or a third party we work with, is active only while you are connected to the Sites, and is deleted or deactivated thereafter.  
  **Mobile Device Identifiers:** Certain mobile service providers uniquely identify mobile devices and we or our third-party service providers may receive such device information if you access the Sites through mobile devices. Certain features of the Sites may require collection of mobile phone numbers and we may associate that phone number with the mobile device identifiers. Additionally, some mobile phone service providers operate systems that pinpoint the physical location of devices that use their service. Depending on the provider, we and our third-party service providers may receive this information.  
If we associate any such passively-collected information with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information. 

### Information from Third Parties

We also may, from time to time, obtain supplemental information about you from third party sources. If we combine the information we receive from these third party sources with Personal Information about you, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.

### Use of Personal Information

We may store and use Personal Information for many purposes including to:  
• Send you e-mail or mobile communications, such as newsletters and promotional offers, on behalf of Bottlenotes or third parties;  
• Send you information regarding the Sites, including features, products or services;  
• Contact you with regard to surveys or Promotions in which you have participated;  
• Complete a transaction or authorize a purchase that you have requested;  
• Verify the accuracy of information you submitted to us;  
• Collect and respond to reports of inappropriate conduct by Visitors;  
• Conduct aggregate research or analyze the performance of our products or services;

### Disclosure of Information

We may, in our sole discretion, share with third parties information that is not associated with your name or identity, such as web site usage information, anonymous Demographic Information, and aggregate user statistics.
