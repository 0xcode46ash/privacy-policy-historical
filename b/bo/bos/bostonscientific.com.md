_Cookies_  
BSC uses both "session" and "persistent" cookies on this Site. A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent to your browser and stored in your computer's hard drive. The purpose of a cookie is to remember certain user inputs on the Site. Personalization features also use cookies to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. 

Session cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your web browser or turn off your computer. Persistent cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. They store information on your computer for a number of reasons, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (i.e., username and password), helping to determine what areas of the Site you find most valuable, and customizing the Site based on your preferences on an ongoing basis. Persistent cookies placed on your computer by this Site may hold personal data, but only if you are a registered user or have otherwise consented to the provision of personal data in accordance with the terms of this Policy. Personal data would be used for things like simplifying the login process or serving personalized content on the site. Otherwise, the Site's server only knows that an unidentified visitor with your cookies has returned to the Site. In addition to customization, persistent cookies will be used to provide you with better service on the Site, to compile and analyze statistics and trends, and to otherwise administer and improve the Site for your use. Subject to applicable law and in accordance with the terms of this Policy, information gathered through the use of persistent cookies on the Site may also be shared with third parties who assist us with the management or optimization of our Sites and the delivery of enhanced user experience.

This will notify you whether or not you are required to accept the cookie in order to view certain Site content, and allows you to decide if you want to accept the cookie or not. You can also set your browser to accept all cookies or to refuse cookies altogether. If you do prevent your computer from accepting cookies, you will still be able to fully access the Site, although you may lose some additional functionality and convenience provided through the use of cookies.

_3rd Party Tracking_  
The use of cookies by our third parties is covered by our privacy policy. We may not always have access or control over these cookies, however the third parties act on our behalf. Our third parties use session ID cookies to track certain information about your behavior while visiting the Site, to facilitate surveys, and to identify groups of users and deliver appropriate Site content and services, as well as feedback related to marketing and email campaigns. Our third parties employ clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), images, and scripts that help them better manage Usage Data. We do not tie the information gathered to your personal data. 

_Social Media Widgets_  
Our Site may include widgets, such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site.

Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with this feature are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it. 

_Clear Gifs_  
The Site may also use clear gifs (also known as web beacons) in combination with cookies, in order to help Site operators understand how visitors interact with the Site. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel by 1 pixel in size) that is placed on the Site, which allows the Site to measure the actions of a visitor who opens the page that contains the clear gif. BSC uses clear gifs to measure traffic and related behavior, and to improve your experience when visiting the Site. We also use clear gifs to manage the content available on the Site. Clear gifs are not tied to personal data.
