## 1\. What Information Do We Collect

The Boston Herald collects both personal information and non-personal information about you in order to enhance your experience on our Site. 

First, we collect the personal information that you provide to us, such as the information you type into forms when you register for our site, subscribe, participate in a chat, complete a survey, place an order, or enter a contest. This personal information may include your name, email address, mailing address, gender, age, and other demographic information. If you make a purchase from us, such as through the Boston Herald Store, we may also collect and store credit card information and other billing information.

If you choose to log in, create an account, or otherwise connect with the Site through a third-party account (such as Disqus, Facebook, Google+, Twitter, or other services), you are asking and authorizing that third-party service to send us certain information from your profile, as it may be updated from time to time, and you authorize us to collect, store, and use all of the information that is or may become available to us through the third-party service’s interface. Certain features on the Site or Services may allow you to submit content that is designed to be visible to other users, such as comments, recommendations, reviews, and ratings. Any information that you disclose in these submissions becomes public, along with your screen name or ID, any image or photo, or other information that you have made available. We are not responsible for the information you choose to submit through these features. For more information, please read our [Terms of Service](http://bostonherald.com/about/terms_of_service "Boston Herald Terms of Service"). 

Please be aware that certain sections of the Site or Services are operated by third party content providers, and any information collected in these sections is covered by the third party’s privacy policies. For instance, our Carfind and Homefind features are powered by AdPerfect, and any information collected there is subject to the [AdPerfect privacy policy](http://www.adperfect.com/privacy-policy/). If you conduct a search on Jobfind, you will be using the Monster.com website, and any information collected there is subject to the [Monster.com privacy policy](http://inside.local-jobs.monster.com/privacy/home.aspx). Other third party content providers, with links to their privacy policies, include [NewsBank](http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_action=privacy&d_place=United%20States&p_product=NewsLibrary&p_theme=newslibrary2), [Legacy](http://www.legacy.com/ns/PrivacyPolicy.aspx), [The Sporting Network](http://www.sportsnetwork.com/merge/tsnform.aspx?c=sportsnetwork&page=policies/privacy.htm), [Zap2It](http://privacy.tribune.com/), and [BankRate](http://www.bankrate.com/coinfo/privacy.asp). 

In addition, we collect non-personal information. For instance, when you interact with our sites and services, we collect information about your computer or mobile device, unique device identifiers, browsing history, cookies, and geolocation information. We also use various methods and technologies to collect information so that we can learn about how you use our Site and Services, including cookies and web beacons, as further described in this Privacy Policy, and web logging, which allows us to collect the standard information that your web browser sends to every web site you visit, such as your IP address, browser type and language, and the site you came from, as well as the pages you visit and the links you click while using the Boston Herald’s Site and Services.

## 2\. How Do We Use The Information That We Collect

  1. **To provide you with services and to communicate with you.**

Our primary goal in collecting information is to improve your experience on our Site and Services. We use your information to customize certain features of the Site and Services, for instance, to tailor your experience to the type of device you are using to access the Site and Services. We may use your history, for instance, to recommend certain articles content to you. 

We also use the information that we collect to provide you with the services that you’ve requested, such as allowing you to access certain content, to comment on articles, or to use message boards. If you signed up to receive email newsletters, we will use your information to send those newsletters to you. You can unsubscribe from newsletters by using the “unsubscribe” link in the email.

We also use your personally identifiable information to contact and communicate with you. For instance, we use your information to provide you with legal notices, or to advise you of any changes to the Services or to our Terms of Service or this Policy. 

We may also use information about you and your activities on the Site or Services to send you offers, promotions, and information that may be of interest to you. If you do not wish to receive such communications, please contact us at [customerservice@bostonherald.com](mailto:customerservice@bostonherald.com).

  2. **To provide you with relevant advertising.**

In order to provide the Site and Services, we display advertisements. We use the information that we collect from you to allow advertising to be targeted to the relevant audience. For instance, we may use demographic and preference information that you provide to deliver targeted advertising. This allows users to see the advertising that is most likely to interest them, and allows our advertisers to provide their content to people who are most likely to be receptive. If we disclose information to third-party advertisers, it is only in aggregate or de-identified form.

  3. **To improve the Site and Services.**

We may do research into the users’ demographics, interests, purchasing behavior, and the ways they use Site and Services. In doing these analyses, we may use the personally identifiable information that you provide to us in addition to the data from our server log files or from surveys. This research allows us to better understand our users and to improve our products and services. We may share aggregated, de-identified data with advertisers or other businesses. We may also match user information with third-party data, subject to the terms of confidentiality agreements. For example, we may use information from other companies to customize certain services to your geographic area based upon your IP address.




## 3\. How Do We Share The Information We Collect?

The information that we collect, including any personally identifiable information that you provide, may be shared by Herald Interactive, Inc. with its parents, subsidiaries, and affiliated entities. We may also provide that information to vendors who provide services under contract to the Boston Herald, such as hosting companies and list managers. Unless otherwise stated in this Policy or at the time of collection, our policy is that we will not sell, rent, share, or authorize any third party to use your email address or any information that personally identifies you without giving you prior notice. In the future, we may sell, buy, merge or partner with other companies or businesses. In the event of such a transaction or transactions, we may include your information among the transferred assets. 

We also share information about our user audience in aggregate or de-identified form, and nothing in this Policy restricts our use of aggregated or de-identified information in any way.

Please note that it may be necessary to disclose your personal information and your opt-out preference to third parties to allow them to remove or suppress your name from future solicitations.

In addition, we may use or share your personally identifiable information in the following specific circumstances:

  1. **Print subscribers.**

If you are a print subscriber to the Boston Herald newspaper, we may exchange or rent your personally identifiable information, such as when you first subscribed to the Boston Herald, with other reputable companies that offer information or products through direct mail and/or email. If you prefer that we do not share this information, you may opt-out by contacting us at [customerservice@bostonherald.com](mailto:customerservice@bostonherald.com). 

  2. **Service providers.**

We have contracts with third parties to provide services on our behalf, such as credit-card and billing processing, shipping, e-mail distribution, list processing, analytics, and promotions. We provide these service providers with only the information that they need to perform their services, and we have written agreements that prohibit them from using this information in any other way, or sharing or reselling the information.

  3. **Contests and promotions.**

We may display contests and promotions on the Site or Services that are sponsored by companies other than the Boston Herald, or that are co-sponsored by another company and us. Some or all of the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with such a contest or promotion may be shared with the sponsor. The exact rules may vary in each case but the specific rules for any contest or promotion will state how that information may be used. You can decide not to participate in the contest or promotion if you don’t want your personally identifiable information to be shared, but you may not be able to participate if you chose not to share personally identifiable information.

  4. **Legal process and other special circumstances.**

We may disclose your information, including personally identifiable information, in response to a request from law enforcement, a subpoena, or a court order, or when we may otherwise be required by law. We may also disclose or use your personally identifiable information in special cases when we have a good faith belief that disclosing or using this information may be necessary to (1) identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms of Service; or (2) protect our rights or property, including protecting against the misuse or unauthorized use of our Site or Services; or (3) protect the personal safety or property of other users of the site or Services or the public. 




## 4\. How Do We Use Cookies and Similar Technologies

  1. **Cookies, pixels, web beacons, and other tracking.**

Our Site and Services may use cookies, web beacons or pixels, Flash cookies, HTML5 local storage, and other similar technologies. We use these technologies to manage your access to the Site and Services (e.g., so you don’t need to repeatedly enter your password), to recognize you and provide personalization (e.g., so you don’t see the same ads too frequently), to measure traffic patterns and help us understand how our users use our site. You can change the settings on your browser to opt out of receiving cookies delivered by the Boston Herald, but you will not be able to access certain areas or features on our Site or Services if your computer does not accept cookies from us. Please note that Flash cookies operate differently from browser cookies, and cookie management tools available in a web browser will not remove flash cookies. To learn more about how to manage Flash cookies, you can visit the [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) website and make changes at the [Global Privacy Settings Panel](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager02.html).

Online advertisers may also use their own cookies to facilitate serving particular ads, such as tailoring ads to your interests, and to avoid sending you ads you’ve already seen. For more information about your choices relating to third party advertisers’ cookies, [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/). Your access to our Site and Services should not be affected if you choose not to receive third party cookies.

  2. **Analytics.**

We may enter contracts with third-party service providers to collect non-personally identifiable data on behalf of the Boston Herald and provide us with information, reports, and analysis about the usage, general location information, and browsing patterns of users of the Site and Services. All of the data collected by these providers on our behalf is owned by us.

We do not have control over these service providers' use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used. You can learn more information about some of these service providers, including their privacy policies and opt-out choices, by visiting [comScore’s Privacy Statement](http://www.comscore.com/About_comScore/Privacy_Policy "comScore’s Privacy Statement"), [Quantcast’s Privacy Policy](https://www.quantcast.com/how-we-do-it/consumer-choice/privacy-policy/ "Quantcast’s Privacy Policy"), [Google Analytics Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/analytics/learn/privacy.html "Google Analytics Privacy Policy"), and [Parsely’s Privacy Policy](http://www.parsely.com/privacy.html "Parsely’s Privacy Policy").

  3. **IP addresses.**

Our servers log Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which identify the location of your computer on the Internet. We use this data to administer our networks and for troubleshooting. We also use this information, in aggregated form, to track our users’ access to our Site and Services. We may share this information on an aggregated, anonymous basis with third parties, such as advertisers.

  4. **Log files and history.**

Our servers automatically log information about your use of the Site and Services, such as the pages that you visit and the length of time you spend on a particular page. We may use your specific history information to provide you with information that is tailored to your interests, such as recommendations or advertisements. We also use log files in aggregate fashion to analyze visitors’ use of our Site and Services.

  5. **Location information.**

Some of our mobile applications may be able to deliver content based on your current location. If you choose to enable that feature of the app, your current location will be stored locally on your device and used by the app. If you choose to have a location-based search saved to your history, we may receive and store that information on our servers. We will not receive or store your mobile location information if an app does not have a location-based feature or if you choose not to enable it. Please note that our apps may have their own privacy policies.




## 5\. How Do We Use E-Mail to Communicate With You?

The Boston Herald does not share, sell, rent, swap or authorize any third party to use your e-mail address for commercial purposes without your permission. If you believe that you have received an e-mail from us in error, please contact us at [customerservice@bostonherald.com](mailto:customerservice@bostonherald.com).

We reserve the right to send you e-mail relating to your account, such as confirmations, notifications about changes to the Site or Services and/or to our Privacy Policy, and similar transactional communications. If you have registered for online discussions or similar services, you may also receive e-mail relating to your participation in those activities.

You can subscribe to receive e-mail newsletters from the Boston Herald. If you wish to stop receiving a particular newsletter, you can use the “unsubscribe” feature in each newsletter.

From time to time we may send you e-mail about products and services that we think may be interesting to you. If you do not wish to receive these communications, you can use the “unsubscribe” feature in each such email.

We may occasionally send you an e-mail inviting you to provide feedback or participate in a survey. This feedback allows us to improve our Site and Services. Unless otherwise stated in the invitation, any information you provide will not be shared with third parties except in aggregate form.

You can choose to receive e-mail in either plain text or in HTML format. When we send you e-mail in HTML format, we may include a web beacon or pixel so that we can determine whether you have opened the e-mail. We will share this information only in aggregate form.

If you contact us by e-mail, we will use your e-mail address to respond to you. Please exercise caution in disclosing personal information, as email sent over the internet is not necessarily secure.

Our Site offers a “send this page by email” feature that allows you to share articles. We may save the e-mail addresses that you provide, for your future convenience, but we do not use them for any other purpose.

## 6\. How Do I Change or Review My Personal Information?

If you would like to review and update your Boston Herald account information, please send an email to [customerservice@bostonherald.com](mailto:customerservice@bostonherald.com).

## 7\. How Do We Protect Your Information?

The Boston Herald has implemented commercially reasonable physical, technical, and administrative controls and procedures to protect the information that we collect. Unfortunately, no method of storage or transmission over the Internet can be 100% secure, and so we cannot guarantee that your information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards. Please help keep your account safe by using a strong password.

## 8\. How Do We Respond to "Do Not Track"

At present, there is no standard or agreement on how to respond to “do-not-track” signals that may be sent by web browsers. Accordingly, the Boston Herald currently does not take any action in response to these signals. We may reassess how to respond to these signals if and when a final standard is established and accepted. In the meantime, and as described above, you can opt out of many advertisers’ use of cookies to tailor advertising to you by visiting [www.aboutads.info/choices](http://www.aboutads.info/choices/).

## 9\. How Do We Protect Children's Privacy

The Site and Services are not intended for children, especially children younger than 13. The Boston Herald does not knowingly collect or store any personal information about children under the age of 13. Parents should tell their children under 13 not to send any information about themselves to us or disclose it in public discussion areas – including their name, email address, or mailing address. If we learn that we have collected any personal information from a child under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information from our database as quickly as possible.

## 10\. Your California Privacy Rights

California’s “Shine The Light” law permits California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information, if any, for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those third parties. If you are a California resident and would like to request this information or opt-out of the sharing of your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes, please submit your request in writing to [customerservice@bostonherald.com](mailto:customerservice@bostonherald.com). 

## 10\. How May We Change This Policy

The Boston Herald reserves the right to change this Privacy Policy at any time. Any such changes will be posted on this page. If we make a significant or material change in the way we use your personal information, the change will be posted on this page thirty (30) days prior to taking effect and registered users will be notified via e-mail. We may also post a notice on our Site.
