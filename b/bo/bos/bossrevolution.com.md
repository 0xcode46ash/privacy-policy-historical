# Privacy Policy - Boss Revolution

**IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc.**  
**Boss Revolution Privacy Policy**  
Effective and Updated February 6, 2017 

**General**  
IDT Domestic Telecom, Inc. and its affiliates (“ _IDT_ ”, “ _we_ ”, “ _us_ ”, “ _our_ ”) are committed to protecting the privacy of our customers’ personal information. This Boss Revolution Privacy Policy (the “Policy”) is designed to inform you of our policies and procedures regarding the collection and use of your personal information, and your options with regard to that collection and use. 

We may update this Policy from time to time and you are advised to review it periodically for changes. Any updated Policy will be posted at [www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/privacy-policy](https://www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/privacy-policy). Unless otherwise defined in this Policy, terms used in this Policy have the same meanings as in the Boss Revolution User Agreement, which can be found at [www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/terms](https://www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/terms). 

This Policy applies to:

  * our Boss Revolution customers in the United States;
  * visitors and users of www.bossrevolution.com or any other Boss Revolution website (collectively, the “ _Boss Revolution Websites_ ”); and
  * users of any Boss Revolution mobile application (collectively, the “ _App_ ”);
  * users of our Boss Revolution products and services (collectively, the “ _Services_ ”) whether purchased on the Boss Revolution Websites, the App or through an authorized Boss Revolution retailer.



This Policy does not apply to our customers that only use our Money Transfer service and the personal information collected during Money Transfer transactions. The policies and procedures governing the personal information collected during Money Transfer transactions are governed by IDT Payment Services, Inc. and IDT Payment Services of NY LLC’s Privacy Statement, which can be found at [www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/services/money-transfer](https://www.bossrevolution.com/en-us/services/money-transfer). 

**Information We Collect and How We Use It**  
We collect and use both Personal Information and Non-Identifying Information about you. “Personal Information” means information either on its own or in conjunction with other data that enables a specific person to be identified, but does not include “de-identified,” “anonymous,” or “aggregate” information, which is not associated with a specific person. “Non-Identifying Information” means information that by itself cannot be used to identify a specific person (e.g., zip code, location information and individual preferences). Certain Non-Identifying Information would be considered a part of your Personal Information if it were combined with other identifiers (for example, combining your zip code with your street address) in a way that enables you to be identified. But the same pieces of information are considered Non-Identifying Information when they are taken alone or combined only with other non-identifying information (for example, your viewing preferences). We may combine your Personal Information with Non-Identifying Information and aggregate it with information collected from others who use the Services to attempt to provide you with a better experience, to improve the quality and value of the applicable Service and to analyze and understand how our Services are used. We may also use the combined information without aggregating it to serve you specifically, for instance to deliver a product to you according to your preferences or restrictions. 

IDT receives or collects information from you when you use the App, including when you install, access, or use our Services through the App. You provide your mobile phone number to create an account. You provide and we collect the phone numbers in your mobile address book on a regular basis, including those of both the users of our Services and your other contacts. You confirm you are authorized to provide us such numbers. To help you organize how you communicate with others, we may upload you favorites list of your contacts, and you can create, join, or get added to groups and broadcast lists, and such groups and lists become associated with your account information. You may provide us with information related to your use of our Services, including copies of your messages, and how to contact you so we can provide you customer support. We collect from you technical data and related information, including but not limited to, information about your mobile device, system and application software that is gathered periodically to facilitate our provision of the App, Services, software updates and service support. We collect service-related, diagnostic, and performance information. This includes information about your activity (such as how you use our Services, how you interact with others using our Services), log files, and diagnostic, crash, website, and performance logs and reports. We collect device-specific information when you install, access, or use our Services. This includes information such as hardware model, operating system information, browser information, IP address, mobile network information including phone number, and device identifiers. We collect device location information if you use our location features, such as when you choose to share your location with your contacts, view locations nearby or those others have shared with you, and for diagnostics and troubleshooting purposes such as if you are having trouble with our App’s location features. 

Our primary goals in collecting information from you are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your account, and to provide better targeted advertising. We use and share all the information we have to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services. You share your information as you use and communicate through our Services, and we share your information with our affiliates and certain third parties to help us operate, provide, improve, understand, customize, support, and market our Services.

IDT does not sell, license or share Personal Information with others outside the IDT Family of Companies for non-IDT purposes without the consent of the person whose information will be shared, except as explained in this Privacy Policy. 

IDT does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. IDT does not publish directories of our customers’ phone numbers, and we do not provide or make them available to third parties for listing in directories without prior customer consent. 

IDT uses vendors and partners for a variety of business purposes such as to help us offer, provide, operate, repair and bill for products and services we deliver to you. We share information with those vendors and partners to the extent reasonably necessary for them to perform work on our behalf. For example, we may provide your credit card information and billing address to our payment processing company solely for the purpose of processing payment for a transaction you have requested.

**3\. Information Provided to or Used by Third-Party Advertising Entities or Social Networks**  
You may see third-party advertisements on our products and/or the Boss Revolution Websites or App. Some advertisements are chosen by companies that place advertisements on behalf of other third-party advertisers. These companies, often called ad servers, may place and access cookies on your device to collect information about your visit to the Boss Revolution Websites or App. The information they collect from our sites is in a form that does not identify you personally. This information may be combined with similar data obtained from other websites to help advertisers better reach their targeted audiences.

The Boss Revolution Websites and App also include social network or other third-party plug-ins and widgets that may provide information to their associated social networks or third-parties about the IDT page you visit, even if you do not click on or otherwise interact with the plug-in or widget. 

**How to Limit the Sharing and Use of Your Information**  
You have choices about how IDT shares and uses your Personal Information. 

**1\. Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI)**  
There are additional protections that apply with regard to certain information we collect and maintain about the telecommunications services you buy from us and how you use them. This information is categorized by the Federal government as Customer Proprietary Network Information or CPNI. CPNI includes, for example, call details, call location information, and certain information about your rate plans and features. CPNI does not include your name, address, and phone number. Specific laws govern our sharing and use of CPNI. 

You may choose whether to allow IDT to share your CPNI within the IDT Family of Companies for certain marketing purposes. This choice will remain in effect unless you change it. To opt-out of this sharing contact us at [support@bossrevolution.com](mailto:support@bossrevolution.com). 

**2\. Do Not Call Lists**  
Federal “Do Not Call” laws allow you to place residential wireline and wireless phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry to prevent telemarketing calls to those numbers. If you would like to add your numbers to this list, you may do so by calling 1-888-382-1222, or by visiting _www.donotcall.gov_.  


You should be aware that even if you add your number(s) to the Federal or a state Do Not Call list, most telemarketing laws allow companies to contact their own customers. If at any time you would like to be removed from IDT’s telemarketing list, please let us know by contacting us at [support@bossrevolution.com](mailto:support@bossrevolution.com). Please allow 30 days for your telephone number to be removed from any sales programs that are currently underway. Please note that we may still call you regarding your Boss Revolution account and Services even if you remove your number from our telemarketing list. 

**3\. Opting Out of Email and Text Marketing Messages and Push Notifications**  
Marketing emails you receive from IDT include an unsubscribe instruction usually found at the bottom of the email that you may use to opt out of receiving future marketing-related emails. Text and SMS message solicitations from IDT also contain an opt-out feature that you can use to prevent future marketing text and SMS messages from us. You can opt out of receiving push notifications by going to your device "Settings" and clicking on "Notifications," and then changing those settings for some or all of the apps on your device. Different device configurations, or updates to devices, may affect or change how these settings work. Your ability to manage some of our Services could be limited if you withdraw your consent to receive text and SMS messages. IDT does not recommend using those Services without authorization to receive such messages. 

**4\. Information Used for Online Advertising**  
You have choices about whether certain information is collected on the Boss Revolution Websites and App. You can limit the collection of certain website information by deleting or disabling cookies. Most computers’ Internet browsers enable you to erase cookies from your computer hard drive, block all cookies, or receive a warning before a cookie is stored. Please note that disabling cookies may prevent you from using specific features on our sites and other websites, such as ordering products or services and maintaining an online account. 

**Working Together to Help Keep Children Safe**  
IDT does not knowingly market to or collect information from children under the age of 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent. If you allow a child to use your device or our Services, you should be aware that their Personal Information could be collected as described in this Policy. We encourage parents to be involved in the online activities of their children to ensure that no information is collected from a child without parental permission. The IDT network may not be used by customers in any manner for the storage, transmission or dissemination of images containing child pornography or any other illegal or inappropriate activity involving children and we will report any instances of such activity of which we become aware to the appropriate law enforcement authorities.

IDT has technical, organizational and physical safeguards in place to help protect against unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of the customer information we collect or store, including your Personal Information. Employees are trained on the importance of protecting privacy and on the proper access to, use and disclosure of customer information.

Personal Information and records are retained only as long as reasonably necessary for business or legal purposes. IDT secures Personal Information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Personal Information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to our websites through the use of Secure Socket Layer (SSL) encrypted protection. The Boss Revolution Websites and App are PCI compliant in connection with your credit card information. 

Although we work hard to protect the Personal Information that we collect and store, no program is 100% secure and we cannot guarantee that our safeguards will prevent every unauthorized attempt to access, use or disclose Personal Information. IDT maintains security and incident response plans to handle incidents involving unauthorized access to private information we collect or store. If you become aware of a security issue, please contact us.

Please be aware that these forums are accessible to others. We urge you to not submit any Personal Information to these forums because any information you post can be read, collected, shared, or otherwise used by anyone who accesses the forum. IDT is not responsible for the information you choose to submit in these forums. If you post content to information sharing forums, you are doing so by choice and you are providing consent to the disclosure of this information. 

**Your California Privacy Rights**  
California Civil Code Section 1798 entitles California customers to request information concerning whether a business has disclosed personal information to any third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. As stated in this Policy, IDT will not sell or share your Personal Information outside the IDT Family of Companies for their direct marketing purposes without your consent. 

**Changes to This Policy**  
We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy, so please check back periodically for changes. You will be able to see that changes have been made by checking to see the effective date posted at the beginning of the Policy. 

If IDT elects to use or disclose information that identifies you as an individual in a manner that is materially different from that stated in this Policy at the time we collected that information from you, we will give you a choice regarding such use or disclosure by appropriate means, which may include use of an opt-out mechanism.
