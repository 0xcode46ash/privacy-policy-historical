**THIRD PARTY ADS**   
We use a third party provider to place our internet ads.  The provider may collect anonymous information about your visits to our site and your interaction with our products and services.  The provider may also use information about your visits to this and other sites to target advertisements for merchandise and services.  This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag which is industry standard technology used by most major websites.  No personally identifiable information is collected or used in this process.  The provider does not know your name, address, phone number, email address or any of your other personally identifiable information.

We will never request your credit card or other personal information by email.  If you receive an email that appears to be a request from us for personal information, _do_ _not_ _respond_ as this may be a “phishing” scam designed to steal your information.  Never include your credit or debit card number or other sensitive information in an email as it is not a secure means of transmitting information.  We will only request such information during secure transactions at our site.
