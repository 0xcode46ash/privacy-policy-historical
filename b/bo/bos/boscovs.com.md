At Boscov's, we respect our customers and understand that you are concerned about privacy, so we've instituted policies intended to ensure that your personal information is handled safely and responsibly.  We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our Privacy Policy.  This policy was last updated on November 1, 2007.  If you have any questions about this policy you can contact us by mail at Customer Service, ATTN:  Privacy Manager, P.O. Box 4202, Reading, Pennsylvania 19606, by calling our Privacy Hotline at 1-888-600-2728 or click on "E-mail Us" at Boscovs.com.

Boscov's may collect personally identifiable information about you, depending on the services you use.

·         We keep information we receive from you on applications or other forms, including services involving delivery of merchandise and Boscoverage, our extended service plan.

·         We keep information about your transactions with us.

·         We keep information we receive from your Credit Card applications. Credit Card application information is also subject to the pirvacy policies of HSBC; please see your Credit Card Terms and Conditions for further information.

We collect additional various types of information, depending upon how you use our website, Boscovs.com.

·         When you order from us, we collect your name, address, e‑mail address, phone number and credit card number (with expiration date) or electronic gift card number.  We also gather information on the person who will receive any online gift, flower order through TheFlowerClub and similar merchandise and services (e.g., that person's name and address) and retain a record of your purchases.

·         When you sign up for express checkout, we collect your name, mailing address, e-mail address, credit card number and billing address, birth date, and password and password clue (in case you forget your password).  We also may ask for additional information (e.g., about your favorite brands and interests), but you may have the option not to provide it.

We also may receive some information about you from other sources and may add it to your account information.  For example, we might get your updated address from a shipper or information on your preferences from another unaffiliated company conducting a promotion or event with us.

We may acquire customer lists from other parties so that we may invite them to become a new customer of Boscov's or visit us at Boscovs.com.  We provide customers with the opportunity to opt out of receiving future offers.

Boscov's reserves the right to collect or otherwise obtain personally identifiable information about customers and potential customers in any lawful manner.

**What are Cookies and Do We Use Them?**

A cookie is a small piece of information that is sent by a website and saved on your hard disk by your computer's browser.  It holds information a site may need to interact with you and personalize your experience.  At Boscovs.com, we use two kinds of cookies, session cookies and persistent cookies.  Session cookies exist only for as long as your browser remains open.  Once you exit your browser, they go away.  We use session cookies to maintain information we need to have in order for you to shop at Boscovs.com.  For example, the session ID cookie that we ask your browser to hold retains the ID for your shopping bag.  Without the session ID cookie, you can't add merchandise to your bag and carry it to checkout.

Persistent cookies, in contrast, last from visit to visit; they do not go away when you exit your browser.  At Boscovs.com, we use persistent cookies to give you a more personalized shopping experience and to help you navigate our store more efficiently (imagine a more "express" express checkout or being greeted when you come to the site).  You can use our site without accepting a persistent cookie.  To do so, you should set your browser options to reject persistent cookies.  Alternatively, you can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, which provides you with the opportunity to decide whether you want to accept it or not.  In many instances, the "help" button on your browser tool bar will tell you how you can take these steps.  Cookies can be used by a website to recognize you.  But, that does not necessarily mean any personal information is stored in the cookies.  At Boscovs.com, we do not currently store personal information (such as name, home address, credit card information) about you in the cookies.  Anything you choose to tell us about yourself (like your address) is stored safely and separately on our secured servers, and you need to provide a password to access it.  We also may use cookies to look at how groups, rather than individuals, use our website.  In our physical stores, we can observe which aisles and departments are most heavily trafficked and determine what displays or sales are the most successful.  Then, we can identify ways to improve the customer experience.  On the web, cookies help us develop a similar understanding so that we can continue to improve the arrangement, product offerings and merchandise placement you see at Boscovs.com.

We have carefully selected a company, Coremetrics, that will assist us in better understanding your use of our site. Coremetrics will place cookies on your computer to collect information on our behalf that will educate us on such things as search engine referral, how you navigate around our site, unique visitor identification, and product browsing and purchasing information. Boscovs.com does not allow Coremetrics to collect credit card, username or password information. Coremetrics analyzes the information it collects on our behalf and returns it back to Boscovs.com through a secure web connection. The information and analysis will only be used to assist us in better understanding your interests in our web site and how to better serve those interests. Coremetrics is contractually prohibited from using our data for any other purposes or match it against any other information in its possession and is required to maintain all information collected and the analysis in strictest confidence. As a visitor to Boscovs.com, you have the option to deactivate the ability of Coremetrics to analyze your browsing and purchasing behavior on our site. You may also choose to continue to benefit from the improved shopping experience which the Coremetrics analysis allows us to provide to you, but maintain anonymity. To learn more about the various levels of privacy and confidentiality you can select with respect to Coremetrics and to exercise your choice, click here. 

**How Do We Use Your Information?**

We use your information in a number of ways, including the following:

·         To improve the content at Boscovs.com.  For example, we may use cookies to find out which parts of our site or our products are visited most often.

·         To enhance your online shopping experience.  For example, we may use it to recognize you and welcome you to the site.

·         For marketing and promotional purposes.  For example, we may send direct mail, statement stuffers or e-mails to you about products or events that we think may be of interest to you.  We also may send you offers for discounts or free services (e.g., free gift wrap or shipping) on our website.

·         Your information may also be needed to complete transactions you request or to provide services you have requested.  For example, we may need to use your information to keep track of your layaway, to determine if you have a Boscoverage® contract or to keep track of your travel preferences.

Boscov's reserves the right to use personally identifiable information about customers and potential customers in any lawful manner.

**Do We Share Your Information?**

The information gathered, for example, your name and address, may be shared with Boscov?s affiliates.  We may also share the information with unaffiliated third parties, including responsible companies with which we have a relationship.  For example:

·         Information we receive from you on your credit application or other forms, such as your name, address, social security number and date of birth;

·         Information about your transactions with us, our affiliates, or others, such as your account number, parties to transactions, types of goods and/or services purchased and credit card usage; __ and

·         Information we receive from a consumer reporting agency, such as your creditworthiness and credit history _._

We may disclose personally identifiable information about you to the following types of unaffiliated third parties as permitted by law:

·         Other financial service providers. _  _For example, HSBC is a party to a Private Label Credit Card program with Boscov's. 

·         Non‑financial companies, such as other retailers, publishers, direct marketers, companies that provide travel services through Boscov's TravelCenter;

·         Companies with which Boscov's has a joint marketing arrangement; for example Affinion;

·         Some of our vendors may work closely with us to ship your order directly to you for certain specialty items such as furniture, shoes and dinnerware.  In certain instances, we may share certain information about you with that vendor.

·         We may use unaffiliated companies to assist in providing our products and services to customers.

·         We may share your personally identifiable information with outside companies that perform services on our behalf.  For example, we may retain an outside company to manage a database containing certain customer information or to create and distribute an offering by telephone, mail or e‑mail.  In those situations, the outside party is performing work for Boscov's, and Boscov's takes appropriate steps designed to ensure your information is used only to provide the services requested by Boscov's, and not for other purposes.

·         Additionally, Boscov's may share account or other information when we believe it is necessary to comply with law or to protect our interests or property.  This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection.

Finally, Boscov's may share your personal information with unrelated outside companies so that they can directly market their products or services to you if we feel that a company offers products or services that we believe may be of interest.  We may also provide you with the opportunity to sign up at Boscovs.com in order to receive offers by e-mail.

In the event that some or all of the business assets of Boscov's are sold or transferred, we may transfer the corresponding information about our customers.

**Explanation of Opt** **-** **Out Rights**

If you prefer that we not disclose certain personal information about you, you may opt out of those disclosures; that is, you may direct us not to make those disclosures (other than disclosures permitted by law or otherwise exempt from your opt-out rights).  If you wish to opt out of disclosures of nonpublic personal information to unaffiliated companies, you may contact us as described above.

Once you have submitted your request you should assume that it has been successfully received and your request is being processed.  Please allow us 60 calendar days from your request to complete the removal, as some of our promotions may already have been in process before you submitted your request.

You should know that certain information (for example, your name, address and phone number) may still be shared with unaffiliated third parties when it is required to complete a purchase or to provide special services you request.  Your transaction or request is our authorization to provide this information to third parties regardless of your or your joint account holder's previous request to opt-out but only for this transaction or request.

Click here for changing your permission with regard to the Coremetrics cookie. Please note that any request that you make to opt out of our disclosure of data does not also turn off the Coremetrics cookie as you must do that from your own computer.

**Is My Information Secure?**

Boscov's is committed to doing its best to maintain the security of information collected.  To try to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect.
