# Privacy Policy | Boston Market Customer Service

**Last updated: 2/28/2019**

Thank you for visiting our website. We seek to make this site both informative and helpful, while respecting and protecting your privacy. We want you to know what information we collect on our authorized websites, mobile applications, other online services, tools or programs where this Policy appears, in our restaurants and in connection with the things we do and offer (our “?”), and how we use such information, and when we share it with third parties. This Policy applies only to information collected via the methods we address.

Here’s what we’re doing to help create a positive online experience.

Typically, when we say “cookie,” we usually think of tasty, little baked goods. But in this instance, cookies are pieces of data that a web site transfers to your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies to help us understand who is visiting our web site (who is new and who is returning), and what our visitors are looking at. We may use cookies to help us remember you or to help us administer contests or sweepstakes. We may associate your personal information with a cookies file in those instances. You may disable cookies on your web browser, but doing this may limit your experience on our website. We also may use web beacons and other tools, such as geolocation.

California Business & Professions Code Section 22575 (b) (as amended effective January 1, 2014) provides that California residents are entitled to know how a website operator responds to “Do Not Track” (DNT) browser settings. DNT is a feature offered by some browsers which, when enabled, sends a signal to websites to request that your browsing is not tracked, such as by third party ad networks, social networks and analytics companies. However, a uniform standard has not yet been adopted to determine how these signals should be interpreted and what actions should be taken by websites and third parties.

At the present time, we do not respond to DNT signals. We will continue to review DNT and other technologies and may adopt a DNT standard once available.

### Personal Information

In certain instances, we may gather personal information about you either directly or through the activities of third-party Vendors and service providers.

**We collect personal and other Information from various sources (including from our entities who provide services to or for us, who we call our “Vendors”) that may include, for example:**

  * Information you provide directly when you use or otherwise interact with us, complete a survey, contact us through our Guest Contact Center at <email, web address and/or 1-800#> provide feedback and/or submissions, make an inquiry, or submit information through our restaurants, website or mobile applications or in connection what other things we do, like sweepstakes.
  * Information recorded as a result of your interaction with us, or our Vendors and/or use of the Services (including information we receive when you use our VIP program , historical sales information, your geolocation information (which may include specific longitude and latitude) and information about the device you are using (for example, device type, characteristics and status, browser type, operating system and application version and information about how our application is used) or through our marketing activities (see the “Usage Information” and “Third Party Analytics and Targeted Marketing” sections below).
  * Information we collect about you from third parties in order to supplement our existing information about you. For example, your occupation, general geographic location, media and brand preferences, inferred interests, demographic information, purchase behavior, public online activities, and other information about you or your household.
  * Information that you provide as part of entering a contest or sweepstakes online through us or through a third-party website. This information will be used as described in the applicable Official Contest/Sweepstakes Rules.
  * Information that is publicly available, for example information you submit to a blog, chat room or social media network like Facebook or Twitter.
  * Information that your social media network provides to us if you connect your social media account with us. For example, this may include your social media ID or username, name, email address, general location, friends list, and demographic information such as gender or birthday/age. Note that certain of the information we receive will become part of your account(s) with us and will be covered by this Privacy Policy.
  * As described elsewhere in this Policy, the Terms, and/or any applicable terms, or at the time such information is collected.



We may combine information we collect about you, and may combine information we collect about you with information we collect from other sources, for example, our advertisements that you see. See “Usage Information” and “Third Party Analytics and Targeted Marketing” sections of this Policy. We may also associate information we collect about you with information we collect about other users’ accounts if you/your employer has set up an account for multiple authorized users (for example, a business catering account).

Sometimes, for reasons beyond our control, if you try to print a coupon it may not print properly. If this occurs and you still want a coupon, we’ll ask you for your name and address, or your email addresses, so we can send you a coupon or notice of a special. If you don’t want to provide this information, you don’t have to, but we may not then be able to provide you what you requested.

### How We Use the Information We Collect

**We, or our Vendors, may use Personal and Other Information in a number of ways, for example:**

  * To help us better understand and serve you and our other guests.
  * To contact you by email, phone, text, push notice or other method regarding our products and services, including matters related to your account, your order, or your future catering needs.
  * To provide you with, or otherwise respond to your submissions or requests for information and/or services, including but not limited to providing webcasts, text messages, push notices, marketing, and other programs; responding to Guest Care, catering and other inquiries; and letting you know if you qualify for one of our Programs (for example, VIP program).
  * To provide functionality and administer the things we do, including to let you sign up for an account, provide you with available benefits, verify your participation in a program or service, process orders placed and applicable payments, track submissions, and make your historical ordering information available to you.

See “Location” below for more information. If you do not want to share your specific longitude and latitude with us, you may adjust your location preferences on your computer, browser, or mobile device.
  * To enhance our customers’ and Service users’ experiences in our restaurants, on the services or in a program, and enhance our sales building efforts.

### How We Share Information with Third Parties

**We may share your Personal and/or Other Information with third parties as described in this Policy and for our business purposes including, for example:**

  * To our Vendors who are performing services for us, including without limitation companies that host our Services or information systems, deliver communications on our behalf, make gift card and e-gift card services available to you, or otherwise assist us with providing the Services to you.
  * To our affiliates, franchisees, business units, Vendors, consultants and agents, and to other third parties, including as part of our consideration of any franchise application and to administer Programs and Services.
  * To third parties when you use their services together with our Services, or when you share information directly through our Services. For example, the Services may contain links to third-party websites that incorporate comments and social media features. The Services also contain a Facebook “like” button and a Twitter “follow” button. If you choose to use these features or other comment or sharing features provided through the Services, you may disclose your Personal Information not just to third-party websites and services, but also to their users and the public more generally. The Services may also allow you to share portions of your account information with third parties (for example, in connection with your use of an electronic wallet) and will automatically share information about your use of our Services with third parties if you use third party services to interact with your Us account (for example in connection with your use of third party voice assist services). See the “Third-Party Sites” section below.
  * To third parties that operate plug-ins on the Services (such as the Facebook “like” button and the Twitter “follow” button). Even if you do not click on these plug-ins, they may collect information about you, such as your IP address and the pages that you view. They also may set and/or access a cookie. These plugins are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing them.
  * To third parties in the event of a proposed or actual merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, financing, sale, or other transfer of some or all of our business or assets.
  * To Vendors and other third parties to engage in analysis, research, improvements to our products and services, and product development. These parties may use insights gathered from such information to improve their own products or services.
  * To Vendors and other third parties in aggregated form and/or in a format that does not, by itself, identify you individually, such as sharing statistics about users of the Services for our, Supplier’s, and third party(ies)’ business purposes or otherwise.
  * To third parties so they can tell you about their products, services, offers and programs which work with or are otherwise related to us, our services and offers. For example, we may share your information with a payment processor in order for them to tell you about how their services work with our services.
  * Pursuant to judicial or governmental subpoenas, warrants, or other like orders, to cooperate with other requests from government or law enforcement, and in other ways necessary to comply with applicable law, as well as to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, violation of third-party rights, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, or any other similar situation, or violations of the Terms or Program terms. We may also use and share Personal and Other Information to establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. As otherwise described in this Privacy Policy, the Terms, and/or Program terms, or at the time such information is collected.



To learn about opting out of the sharing of your Personal Information, see the “Your Choices and Changing Your Information” section.

### Usage Information

Like most websites, apps and other like services, through your use of the Services we gather traffic patterns, usage information, and similar data. This usage data may identify you individually and we may associate it with personal information that we collect from you on the Services and related to any Program(s) you participate in and as otherwise described in this Policy. (See the “Information We Collect” and “How We Use the Information We Collect” sections of this Policy and any applicable individual Program terms for more details.) We may use this data in aggregated form or share aggregated statistics about visitors to the Services with others outside of our organization, and we may allow third parties to collect and aggregate Other Information through the Services and/or Supplier sites accessible from or through the Services.

We and/or our third-party Vendors may use cookies, pixels and web beacons (described below), device identifiers such as IDFA for iOS or Advertising ID for Android, device location features or beacons, or other similar technology (“Tracking Technologies”), to enhance the browsing and usage experience on the Services and enable certain functionality related to our Services. The information captured about your activities on the Services will also make it possible for us, among other things: (i) to speed navigation and provide you with custom tailored content; (ii) to remember information you gave to us so you do not have to re-enter it each time you visit the Services; (iii) to target advertising as described in the “Third Party Analytics and Targeted Marketing” section below and monitor the effectiveness of certain of our marketing campaigns; (iv) to monitor total number of visitors, pages viewed, the web address you came from, and type of browser you are using; and (v) to enforce limitations on downloads described for online coupons and other similar offers. For example, the Services may use Google Analytics and/or other third party services to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes described in this Policy.

  * “Pixels” or “web beacons” are lines of code used by a website or third-party ad server to cause a cookie to track a user’s activity on particular sites and/or using particular advertising/links, for example, to record that a user has visited a particular webpage or viewed a particular email, and to collect other information about that user on that site, including the IP address of the computer (and therefore infer information, such as geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude)), web pages being viewed, date/time viewed, and user activity on a particular page.
  * “Cookies” are small files or records that are stored on your computer’s hard drive when you visit a website. To block cookies used on the Services, you can clear your browser(s) of all existing cookies and set your browser(s) to refuse cookies. The “help” functionality of your browser(s) will explain how to do this. If you refuse cookies, your experience on the Services, some Programs, and some of our online advertising may be affected — for example you may not be able to utilize all of the features on the Services. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics on websites here.



### Targeted Marketing

We and our Vendors may implement and evaluate our marketing activities and programs, including to engage in targeted and personalized online advertising on the Services, on third-party websites, mobile apps, TV, or other online or offline services operated by third parties. This marketing may be targeted to you based on Personal or Other Information collected over time, such as through your participation in the Programs, your activity on the Services, your device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude), your activity on unaffiliated third-party sites, mobile apps, or other online services, other marketing activities and Programs, and/or from third parties with whom we work. We and our Vendors, including without limitation Facebook, may use Tracking Technologies (as described under “Usage Information” above) to collect information for such marketing and evaluation purposes. For example, our Vendors may use the fact that you visited one of our websites to deliver ads to you on non-Us websites, or they may use the fact that you used our mobile app to deliver ads to you on non-Us mobile apps. We and our Vendors may also identify whether our marketing activities and programs resulted in you engaging in other activities on our Services, our advertising and/or marketing, making purchases from us and/or our franchisees, visiting restaurants, or otherwise engaging with us. In addition, we and our Vendors may target our ads to you on your TV or other online services if we or our Supplier have identified you as our customer using information we share with them, such as your name, email address, or mailing address.

### Cross-Device Technologies

We and our Vendors may use collected information to establish connections among related web browsers and devices (such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs) for targeted advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. We and/or our Vendors may match your browsers or devices if you log into the same online service on multiple devices or if your devices share similar attributes that support an inference that they are used by the same person or household. This means that your online behavior (information about your activity on websites or apps on your current browser or device and your device’s geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude)) may be combined with information collected from your other browsers or devices. For example, our Vendors may use this information to deliver an ad on your tablet or smartphone, to limit the number of times you see an ad across your devices, and to help measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns across devices.

### Location

We and/or our Vendors may collect the geolocation (which may include specific longitude and latitude) of your mobile device based upon information identified by your mobile device by, for example, using satellite, cell phone tower, WiFi signals, beacons, Bluetooth and near field communication protocols. We may use and share your mobile device’s geo-location together with Personal or Other Information to identify your local restaurant, to provide you with personalized messaging or content and/or for marketing purposes by email, push notification, online or in-app advertising, or by other means, as described in “Targeted Marketing” above and/or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. See “Opt-Out Choices” below to opt-out of location collection. If you choose to opt-out of location collection, certain functionality of our Services may not be available.

### Opt-Out Choices

You may opt out of certain of our or our Vendors’ targeted marketing practices in web browsers and mobile applications by following the instructions below. Please note that the opt-out will apply only to the specific browser or device from which you opt out. You will need to opt out separately on all of your browsers and devices. If you delete or reset your cookies or mobile identifiers, change browsers, or use a different device, any opt-out cookie or tool may no longer work and you will have to opt out again. Note that some Vendors may also make their own opt-out process available. Please note that even if you choose to opt-out of receiving targeted advertising, you may still receive advertising about us – it just will not be tailored to your interests.

  * Web Browser Opt-Out. To opt out in web browsers, please visit the Network Advertising Initiative Consumer Opt-Out Page at www.networkadvertising.org/choices, the Digital Advertising Alliance Consumer Choice page at www.aboutads.info/consumers, and the Digital Advertising Alliance of Canada Consumer Choice page at www.youradchoices.ca/choices. Our Services currently do not respond to Do Not Track browser signals, but some of our third-party Vendors may permit you to opt out using Do Not Track functionality.
  * Mobile Application Opt-Out. To opt out in mobile apps, please download the Digital Advertising Alliance’s AppChoices tool at www.aboutads.info/appchoices and adjust the advertising preferences on your mobile device. For example, to adjust your advertising preferences in iOS, visit the limit ad tracking settings within the Settings functionality of your mobile device; to adjust your advertising preferences in Android, visit the opt-out of interest-based ads settings within the Settings functionality of your mobile device. You can also use the settings within your device to opt out of or turn off push notifications.
  * Location Opt-Out. If you do not want us to use your specific longitude and latitude information for targeted marketing purposes, you may adjust your location preferences on your computer, browser, or mobile device. You can also stop our collection of location information by uninstalling our mobile application from your device.



If you would like to request that we limit the use or sharing of your Personal Information for other targeted marketing purposes, please contact us by accessing our Guest Care Center at bostonmarket.com. If your Personal information has previously been shared with our Vendors or other third parties, any request to limit such sharing may not be effective with respect to such previously shared Personal Information. Some of the Vendors that display our ads on their services may provide you with additional choices to opt out of targeted advertising. For example, social media and TV providers may allow you to control your advertising preferences directly through their services. Please review the privacy policies of the third-party services you use for more information.

### Children’s Privacy

The Services are not directed toward children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, please ensure that you use the Services with the permission of a parent or guardian. You must be 18 to use some portions of the Services. If a child under 13 provided this Site with Personal Information, we ask that a parent or guardian contact us by accessing our Guest Care Center at bosotnmarket.com call us at  or write us at Gust Contact Center 14103 Denver West Pkwy., Lakewood, CO 80401, so that we may promptly delete the child’s information from our records.

### Security and Cross-Border Transfer of Your Information

We maintain reasonable physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Information. Unfortunately though, we can’t guarantee that any safeguards or security measures will be sufficient to prevent a security problem. If you believe your account(s) have been compromised, please immediately contact us by accessing our Guest contact Center at bostonmarket.com and take immediate action to remove the credit card, gift card, or other payment information associated with your account(s). Email submissions over the Internet may not be secure, so please do not include any sensitive or confidential information in your message to us.

Personal and Other Information may be transferred to and stored on computers and servers located in the United States and other countries located outside your country of residence. The laws of these countries may not offer a level of privacy protection for Personal Information as great as that offered in your country of residence. Further, Personal Information might be disclosed to governments or law enforcement agencies in these countries where required by law. By agreeing to this Policy, using the Services, and/or sharing your Personal Information with us, you consent to such transfer.

### Your Choices and Changing Your Information

We provide you with the ability to review or change certain of your Personal Information and make certain choices about how we use or share Personal or Other Information. You may review, change, or exercise choice regarding certain of your Personal or Other Information as follows:

  * To request that we do not share your Personal Information with third parties for their own marketing purposes on a going-forward basis, please contact us by accessing our Guest Contact Center at bostonmarket.com.



In some cases this information may not be immediately updated, subject to retention for Program administration, dispute resolution, troubleshooting, and other valid legal or business reasons. Your historical usage information may remain in our records. Also see the “Usage Information” and “Analytics” and “Opt-Out Choices” sub section of the “Third Party Analytics and Targeted Marketing” section above for other limitations. Other choices may be available within your account page or presented to you in certain marketing communications.

### California Privacy Rights

California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits customers of ours who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of Personal Information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. To make such a request, please contact us by accessing our Guest Contact Center at bostonmarket.com, or write us at: GCC, Boston Market Corp, 14103 Denver West Pkwy., Lakewood, CO 80401.

### Third-Party Sites/Services

The Services may access or provide links to web sites or online services not operated by Us, including our Supplier(s) related to certain Programs or services offered through the Services (such as gift card purchases or interaction with voice assist services or other third party assisted ordering processes (e.g., Google, Facebook, Instagram)). We may also provide you with access to third-party functionality that allows you to post certain content from the Services to your social media account(s). Any information that you provide that interacts with the Third Party service or that you post to a third-party site or service is governed by the applicable third party’s terms and privacy policy. We assume no responsibility for third-party services or websites, including but not limited to, the privacy practices of these third-party sites. We encourage you to be aware of this when you leave the Services and/or share information with third parties or the public, and we recommend that you review the privacy policies of such third-party sites.

If we hire a third party to perform a service for us, and that third party requires access to your personal information to perform that service, they may only use it for that limited purpose, and not for any other reason.

Your information is not sold, transferred or disclosed to third parties, and we do not send unsolicited e-mail. We may respond to e-mail you send us though, and we may ask you if you want to receive special offers from us or from third parties with whom we have a business relationship.

### E-mail

If you have questions or comments, we encourage you to contact our [Guest Contact Center](https://web.archive.org/company/contact-us/) team. If you contact us via e-mail, the only identifying information we keep is the e-mail itself.

We use your information solely for internal purposes. (For example, we may use it to fulfill your request.) We don’t sell it or transfer it to third parties, and we don’t send unsolicited e-mail.
