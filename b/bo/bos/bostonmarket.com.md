**Boston Market Corporation Internet Site Privacy Policy**

Boston Market Corporation ("BMC") is pleased to provide information to all of its customers about its web site. BMC wants to make its site as informative and helpful as possible while respecting your privacy. Please be assured that BMC has taken steps to protect the privacy of its on-line visitors. 

BMC uses "cookies" (i.e., pieces of information that a web site transfers to an individual's hard drive for record-keeping purposes) only to obtain certain information if a customer chooses to print a coupon. The cookie assigns a user identification number so that when you return to the site you don't have to re-enter your personal information.

BMC only gathers personally identifiable data, such as first and last names, addresses, and email addresses, when voluntarily submitted by a web site visitor. For example, personally identifiable information may be collected in order to provide you a coupon or other discount and track your food preferences for such coupons, or to get your feedback on our site and our products, or to enter you in one of our contests or sweepstakes. Sometimes, for reasons beyond our control, our coupons do not print proerly. If this occurs, and you still want to receive a coupon, we will ask you for information such as your address, so that we may send you one. You, of course, may decline to provide it. This information is used solely by BMC and other entities that provide products using the Boston Market brand name, and entities that provide technical or fulfillment services to BMC for internal purposes, like improving the site or to fulfill your requests; it is not sold to third parties. BMC does not send unsolicited email. BMC, however, may respond to email it receives.

Visitors with questions are encouraged to use our customer service number 1-800-365-7000. If a visitor chooses to contact BMC via email, the only identifying information retained is the email itself. Personally identifiable information may be collected in order to respond to a request for information or a question concerning the company or Boston MarketÂ® food. This information is used solely by BMC for internal purposes, like fulfilling your requests; it is not sold or transferred to third parties. BMC does not send unsolicited email.

BMC may offer links to other sites. If you visit one of these linked sites, you should review the linked site's privacy and other policies. BMC is not responsible for the policies or activities of other companies. 

BMC reserves the right to use or disclose any information as needed to satisfy any law, regulation or legal request, to protect the integrity of the site, to fulfill your requests, or to cooperate in any law enforcement investigation or an investigation on a matter of public safety. 

From time to time, it may be necessary for BMC to change this privacy policy, so check here in the future. Rest assured, however, that any changes will not be retroactively applied and will not alter how previously collected information is handled.
