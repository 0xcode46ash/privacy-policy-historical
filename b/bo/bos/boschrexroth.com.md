## Data transfer

**Data transfer to other controllers**

Principally, your personal data is forwarded to other controllers only if required for the fulfillment of a contractual obligation, or if we ourselves, or a third party, have a legitimate interest in the data transfer, or if you have given your consent. Particulars on the legal bases can be found in the Section - Purposes of Processing and Legal Bases. Third parties may also be other companies of the Bosch group. When data is transferred to third parties based on a justified interest, this is explained in this data protection notice.

Additionally, data may be transferred to other controllers when we are obliged to do so due to statutory regulations or enforceable administrative or judicial orders. 

**Service providers (general)**

We involve external service providers with tasks such as sales and marketing services, contract management, programming, data hosting and hotline services. We have chosen those service providers carefully and monitor them on a regular basis, especially regarding their diligent handling of and protection of the data that they store. All service providers are obliged to maintain confidentiality and to comply to the statutory provisions. Service providers may also be other Bosch group companies.

**Transfer to recipients outside the EEA**

We might transfer personal data to recipients located outside the EEA into so-called third countries. In such cases, prior to the transfer we ensure that either the data recipient provides an appropriate level of data protection (e.g. due to a decision of adequacy by the European Commission for the respective country or due to the agreement based on so-called EU model clauses with the recipient) or that you have consented to the transfer.

You are entitled to receive an overview of third country recipients and a copy of the specifically agreed-to provisions securing an appropriate level of data protection. For this purpose, please use the statements made in the Contact section.

**Duration of storage, retention periods**

Principally, we store your data for as long as it is necessary to render our Online Offers and connected services or for as long as we have a justified interest in storing the data (e.g. we might still have a justified interest in postal marketing even after fulfillment of our contractual obligations). In all other cases we delete your personal data with the exception of data we are obliged to store for the fulfillment of legal obligations (e.g. due to retention periods under the tax and commercial codes we are obliged to have documents such as contracts and invoices available for a certain period of time).

**Data processing under other legal regulations**

We collect data based on other legal regulations. These include, for example, regulations for export controls, EC regulations (terrorist list screening), military, known consignors (air freight security law), taxes, ILSG, general equality law, labour law and many more. We treat the data according to the specifications of the respective legal regulation and analogously their storage obligations. Personal data will be deleted immediately after the end of the storage obligations.

## **Registration**

If you wish to use or get access to benefits requiring to enter into the fulfillment of a contract, we request your registration. With your registration we collect personal data necessary for entering into the fulfillment of the contract (e.g. first name, last name, email address) as well as further data on voluntary basis, if applicable. Mandatory information is marked with an *.

The data provided by you will only be stored for the respective registration process and used exclusively for the performance of the services provided. For further details, please refer to the respective offer listed below in the corresponding data protection information. 

We strongly recommend that you change the passwords for your login regularly and keep them confidential. Never use trivial passwords.

**Log files**

Each time you use the internet, your browser is transmitting certain information, which we store in so-called log files.

We save log files for a short period of time to determine service disruptions and for security reasons (e.g., to investigate attack attempts) and delete them afterwards. Log files which need to be maintained for evidence purposes are excluded from deletion until the respective incident is resolved and may, on a case-by-case basis, be passed on to investigating authorities.

Log files are also used for analysis purposes (without the IP address or without the complete IP address). Also see module web analysis.

In log files, in particular the following information is saved:

• IP address (Internet Protocol address) of the end-device from which the Online Offer is accessed,

• Internet address of the website from which the Online Offer was accessed (so called origin or referrer URL),

• The name of the service provider through which the Online Offer is accessed,

• File names or information that were accessed,

• Access time, date and access duration,

• Transmitted data volume,

• http status code (for example, request was successful or request failed)

## Communities

We offer you the opportunity of becoming a member of one of our communities. Public Community Content can also be consumed without registration. Once registered, you can create a user profile, manage specific settings, interact in the communities and communicate with other members. Your data generated therein is only used in the scope of the consent granted by you for the respective marketing, market research and service purposes. You can withdraw your consent at any time.

The public profile of a community member only shows the nickname, acquired badges (trophies), the rank and the last user interactions. The e-mail address or other personal data are not visible.

All other data, which is generated by you in the communities, e.g. by creating, comments or pictures, are automatically publicly accessible and will be linked to your user profile. A special case of this are so-called private communities, where only registered members can enter the community and see the content.

Typical community elements in which community members interact and/or create content are for example Forum, Blog, Tribal Knowledge Base (Wiki), Question & Answers and Idea Exchange.

**Protection of intellectual property in communities**

Especially in community elements like Idea Exchange, the submission of ideas by the users themselves is an essential part of the community. If you submit your own ideas, be aware that especially in public communities every visitor can see these ideas. Although comprehensive protection of intellectual property in communities is not possible, we have at least elementary mechanisms that curb infringements in this respect:

• The creator of an idea is explicitly identified by the nickname and the date of creation.

• The community guidelines instruct members to report "stolen" ideas or infringements of intellectual property rights

Any protection of intellectual property beyond this community self-regulation is not possible for us and we are not liable for infringements in relation to intellectual property brought in.

You are free to create content with your intellectual property or not. If you fear that your intellectual property rights may be infringed, we recommend that you do not create such content.

**Community Registration**

To be able to interact in the Community, we request that you register. You can use the central User-Management-System of Bosch to create a "Bosch Global User", which can also be used for other Platforms of the Bosch Group and which ensures SSO between the different Platforms of the Bosch Group. Within the scope of the registration we collect personal data necessary for the formation and the fulfillment of the contract (Nickname, e-mail address) as well as, if applicable, additional data on a voluntary basis (e.g. first name, last name). Mandatory statements are marked with a * 

## Usage of cookies

**General**

Cookies are small text files that are saved on your computer when an Online Offer is accessed. In case you access this Online Offer another time, your browser sends the cookies' content back to the respective seller and, thus, allows the re-identification of the terminal device. Reading the cookies allows us to design our Online Offers optimally for you and makes it easier for you to use them.

**Deactivation and deletion of cookies**

When visiting our internet pages you will be asked in a cookie layer pop up whether you wish to allow the cookies which are set on our page or if you wish to deactivate them in the settings.

Deactivating cookies may disable individual functions of our internet pages. Please note that an opt-out cookie may, for technical reasons, only be set with the actual browser. In case you delete cookies or use a different browser or a different terminal device, you must opt- out again. 

The preference setting does not apply to cookies that are set during your visit on third party internet pages by other providers.

Your browser allows you to delete any cookies at all times. To do so, please consult your browser's help functions. This might, however, lead to individual functions no longer being available.

• Cookies that store certain user preferences (e.g. search or language settings),

• Cookies that store data to ensure a trouble-fee playback of video or audio content.

**Analytical cookies**

We use analytical cookies to record the usage behavior (e.g. search queries put in) of our users and to evaluate it statistically.

**Third party advertisement cookies**

We also allow other companies to assess data of our users through advertisement cookies. This allows us and third parties to show the users of our Online Offers interest based advertisements which are based on an analysis of their usage behavior in total (e.g. ad banners clicked on, visited subpages, search queries put in), thus, not restricted to our Online Offers.

**Conversion cookies**

Our conversion tracking partners set a cookie on your computer ("conversion cookie") in case you entered our website through an advertisement of the respective partner. These cookies generally lose their validity after 30 days. In case the cookie has not yet expired, we and the respective conversion tracking partner can see that a particular user clicked the ad and was forwarded to our page. Information gathered through the conversion cookie is used to create conversion statistics and to determine the total number of users who clicked the respective ad and were referred to a page provided with a conversion tracking tag.

**Tracking cookies in connection with social plugins**

Some pages of our Online Offers integrate contents and services from other providers (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) who may in turn use cookies and active components. We are unable to influence the processing of personal data done by these providers. Find more details on social plugins in the Social Plugins section.

## Web analysis

We need statistical information about the usage of our Online Offers to design them to be more user-friendly, to perform range measurements and market research.

For this purpose, we use the web analysis tools described in this section.

The usage profiles created by these tools using analysis cookies or by evaluating log files are not brought together with personal data. The tools either do not use user IP addresses at all or shorten them immediately after gathering them.

The tool sellers process data only as processors subject to our directives and not for their own purposes.

In the following please find information on each tool seller and how you are able to object to the collection and processing of data by the tool.

Be advised that with regard to tools, which use opt-out cookies, the opt-out function is related to that individual device or browser. In case you use several terminal devices or browsers you must opt-out on every device and with every browser used. 

Beyond this, you can avoid the forming of usage profiles by generally deactivating cookie usage. Please refer to the section Deactivate and delete cookies.

**Social Plugins**

In our Online Offers we use so-called social plugins from various social networks. They are individually described in this section.

When using plugins, your internet browser creates a direct connection to the respective social networks’ server. This way, the respective provider receives the information that your internet browser accessed from the respective site of our Online Offers - even if you do not have a user account with this provider or are currently not logged into your account. Log files (including the IP address) are, in this case, directly transmitted from your internet browser to a server of the respective provider and might be stored there. The provider or its server may be located outside the EU or the EEA (e.g. in the United States).

The plugins are standalone extensions by social network providers. For this reason, we are unable to influence the scope of data collected and stored by them.

Purpose and scope of the collection, the continued processing and usage of data by the social network as well as your respective rights and setting options to protect your privacy can be found by consulting the respective social network's data protection notices.

In case you do not wish social network providers to receive and, if applicable, store or use data, you should not use the respective plugins.
