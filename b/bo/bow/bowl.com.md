##  What is "Personal Information?"

"Personal information" refers to information by which someone can determine the identity of another person. 

##  **What Personal Information Does USBC Collect?**

The information we request depends on how you choose to interact with USBC (membership, merchandise purchase, event registration, surveys, etc.). Our policy is to request only the information we need to provide the service you've requested. Providing us all the information we request helps us become more familiar with our members, customers and guests, and helps us provide you a better experience with USBC. We make an effort to include a link to this policy whenever we ask you for personal information. 

_Personal Data_

In some instances, it is necessary for USBC to collect personal information about you to provide a service or carry-out a request. Depending on how you interact with USBC, we may ask for some, or all, of the following: 

  * Name 
  * Mailing address 
  * Phone number 
  * Email address 
  * USBC member ID number 
  * Date of birth 
  * Gender 
  * Credit card information (financial transactions only – membership purchase, merchandise purchase, event registration, etc.) 
  * Household income (demographic purposes only) 

_Preference Data_

As a member, customer or guest of USBC, you are eligible to receive mail and email communications – from USBC and qualified companies – regarding member benefits, events, promotional offers and more. To help us determine what you would and would not like to receive, you have the opportunity to “opt-out” of receiving certain types of communications from USBC. Such communications may be related to: 

  * USBC member benefits 
  * Tournament and event promotions 
  * Members-only discounts and offers from USBC and qualified companies 
  * USBC publications 

There are three methods that allow you to choose not to receive communications from USBC. They include: 
  * Email communications from USBC, or on behalf of a qualified company, include a link to a page on bowl.com which allows you to tell us that you no longer wish to receive a certain type of email. 
  * By creating an account on bowl.com, you can tell us what type of communications you would or would not like to receive from USBC. 
  * Call us at (800) 514-BOWL and tell us what type of communications you would or would not like to receive from USBC. 



## **How Does USBC Use Your Personal Information?**

We use the personal and preference information you provide to enhance your experience with USBC – to provide you with benefits, services, information and communications that we think you will find of value – and to build a demographic profile of our membership (not including names/addresses/phone numbers/email addresses) for potential partners, advertisers and sponsors. 

In addition, we may partner with qualified companies to secure USBC members-only discounts or promotions for products or services. In such arrangements, the company would be allowed to advertise, via mail or email, to USBC members. The company is provided the opportunity to advertise to you, however, the company is **NOT** given your personal information. 

I **n such arrangements, USBC does not, and will not, give your personal information to the company.**

All advertising is conducted through a licensed, bonded, third-party organization that specializes in this service, and does not engage in marketing or advertising, nor does it keep your contact information beyond its intended use.   


We may also use your personal information to develop summary reports for our partners, advertisers and sponsors. An example of a summary report might be

_"100,000 people clicked on this link, and of those people 35% were above the age of 25."_

We may provide this summary information to assist our partners, advertisers and sponsors in determining how to best promote their products and services.

**Is Your Personal Information Safe with USBC?**

One word – **YES!**

USBC has implemented industry-standard security measures to ensure that your personal information is protected. 

All financial and informational transactions are protected by an encrypted security service provided by Verisign, the Internet's leading security provider. 

In the case of financial transactions via credit card, under no circumstances, unless required by law, will credit card information be made available to anyone other than those parties necessary to execute a transaction. In addition, USBC only maintains your credit card information long enough to complete the transaction. Once the transaction is complete, we securely discard the information so it can not be accessed or obtained by anyone.

USBC also has systems in place to restrict internal access to your personal information. Access is limited to USBC employees who require this information to perform their duties and provide the appropriate services to you. 

## **More Information**

We hope this policy has provided you the information you need and answered any questions you may have regarding USBC’s commitment to the privacy and security of your information.
