A cookie is a piece of data stored on the computer that runs an Internet browser.  It can contain information about you, your computer, your browser, your session, the websites you visit, and other information about you or others who use, or have used, the computer or browser you use to access the Internet. The cookies we use, if any, are not linked to any personally identifiable information while using a site unless you have given us permission to link personally identifiable information to one or more cookies.  You give us that permission any time you register on a site, place an order through a site, or identify yourself or the computer you are using through a site.

Most or all browsers permit you to disable or reject cookies.  You can do this by setting the preferences in the browser. Use the “help” feature of your browser to obtain more information about refusing cookies. As of the time we wrote this privacy policy, there was information about how to disable cookies at the following websites.  We do not operate either of these websites and we make no representation or warranty about the information contained in the websites to which these links will take you.

<http://wp.netscape.com/legal_notices/cookies.html>

If you set the browser you use to reject cookies, you can use the sites, but you may not be able to use the full functionality of one or more of the sites or it may take additional time to utilize such functionality.

One or more of the organizations with which we do business, or to which we provide links from a site, also use cookies. We have no control over such organizations’ uses of cookies and users should review the privacy policies of such organizations to determine the uses such organizations make of cookies. 

**Log Files**

We, or our hosting provider may collect traffic information from visitors for statistical analysis and site improvement. When you access a site, we or our hosting provider may collect information about your visit in a log file on a server. Log file information may include, but is not limited to, Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks.  We, or our hosting provider use this information to analyze trends, administer the site, track users’ movements in the aggregate, and gather demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses and other log file information are not linked to personally identifiable information. We do not try to track users or to identify users individually, but we, or our hosting provider do review this information to understand overall trends and to determine what kinds of content are popular and useful to users.

**Sharing**

**(a) Aggregated information**. We, or our hosting provider may share aggregated demographic information with our users, our affiliated organizations, and other organizations with which we do, or contemplate doing, business. Such information is aggregated and is not linked to any information that can identify individual users.

**(b) Outsourcing providers**. We may use outside shipping or other outsourcing providers to process and ship orders, or perform other functions.  We require that these outsourcing providers not retain, share, store, or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes, except for backup and recovery operations. Although we use good faith efforts to ensure compliance by its outsourcing providers, we cannot, and will not, be responsible to users for misuse of personally identifiable information by such outsourcing providers.

**(c) Specific services**. We may have agreements with other parties to provide specific services. When you use such services, we may share personally identifiable information with such parties. In such cases, we will use its good faith efforts to restrict the information provided to the information necessary for the provision of such services.

**(d) General use**. We share personally identifiable information (whether in return for compensation or otherwise) with various vendors, suppliers, and advertisers. While we use good faith efforts to verify that such vendors, suppliers, and advertisers promote products and services of interest to site users, we cannot, and do not, endorse such vendors, suppliers, advertisers, products or services unless we expressly state otherwise. We share only such information as you yourself provide to us or someone else provides about you (such as through a registration process) and do not share personally identifiable information derived indirectly through IP address tracing or similar means. If you wish us to refrain from providing your personally identifiable information in this manner, please see the opt-out information and contact information provided below.

**Links and Information Gathered by Others**

One or more sites may contain links to other websites. We do not operate those websites, we cannot control the information that the operators of such websites gather or what the operators of such websites do with the information, and we are therefore not responsible for the activities of the operators of such websites.

**Newsletter**

If you wish to subscribe to a newsletter we offer or to a mailing list that we maintain, we will collect from you contact information necessary to send the newsletter or other information to you. This is usually limited to your e-mail address, but may include other information.

**Surveys and Contests**

From time to time, we may request information from you using surveys or contests. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice as to whether to disclose this information. Information requested may include contact information (such as name and address) and demographic information (such as zip code and type of user). We will use such contact information to notify winners and award prizes, and to monitor or improve the use of one or more sites and provide aggregated information for our own uses or to our customers or other organizations, and we may also use it to notify you of news about us or our affiliates or promotions of our products or services or the products or services of people with whom we do business.

**Tell-A-Friend**

We may offer a referral service that allows you to inform your friends and other acquaintances about content on the site. If you elects to use such a referral service, we will collect the friend or acquaintance’s e-mail address and use it to send the friend or acquaintance a one-time e-mail inviting the friend or acquaintance to visit one or more sites or providing the information you requested. We store this contact information for the sole purpose of sending the one-time e-mail.

**Security**

Where we collect nonpublic personal information from you, we or one or more of our services providers use industry-standard encryption and security standards to protect such information.  You can tell whether encryption is being used by noting the “locked” or other status indicator on the browser you are using.  If the browser you are using does not indicate that the session is secure (e.g. by displaying a key or other icon), you should assume that the connection is not secure and that third parties will receive the information shared by you and us during that part of the session.

We also use commercially reasonable efforts to protect user information offline. All sensitive user information is maintained in our offices or at the facilities of our information technology provider(s). We cause access to servers and connections to be limited by key or other access.  Only employees or agents who need the information to perform specific functions are granted access to personally identifiable information. We use reasonable efforts to assure that its employees and agents are informed of our security and privacy practices. When we add new policies or change existing policies, we take reasonable steps to notify affected employees and agents.

**Supplementation of Information**

We sometimes supplement the information we receive from you with other information we receive from third party sources, such as credit card issuers or clearinghouses.

**Special Offers**

We may send to you a welcoming e-mail that may also verify password and user name information.  We occasionally send newsletters or information about products, services, and special deals to users like you. You may opt to not receive such informational communications by using the contact information below.

**Site and Service Updates**

We may also send to you updates and service announcements about one or more of the sites. You may not un-subscribe or opt not to receive such announcements because such announcements contain important information about the services offered through the relevant site(s).

**Correcting or Updating Personal Information**

If your personal information changes, or if you no longer desire service, you may contact us using the contact information below and we will accommodate all reasonable requests for such changes.

**Choice/Opt-out**

Users who no longer wish to receive newsletters or promotional materials or have their information provided to third parties may opt to not receive such communications or have information shared by contacting us using the information below.  We will comply with such requests as soon as is commercially practicable.  Such compliance may involve batch processing and other processes that take 30 days or longer.  If you opt not to receive such communications or allow us to share your information and then give your personal information to us again using one of the sites under circumstances that permit us to use your information, we will regard your opt-out as rescinded. 

In most cases, it is impractical for use to stop any other party to whom we have supplied your information from continuing to use the information and opting out will usually not stop other to whom we have provided your information from continuing to use it.

To change your preference with regard to the way your information is treated, visit the appropriate area of the website.

**Response Times**

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to timely make any changes you request. Many such changes are accomplished using batch processing (i.e. collecting a number of similar change requests and making all such changes at once), so the changes may not be immediately effective. If you require an immediate change to your personally identifiable information and are unable to make such a change using the available site resources, please contact us using the information below.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

If we decide to change this privacy policy, we will post the changes on one or more sites and/or other places we deem appropriate.

Except as stated below, we will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected. 

If we decide to use information about you in a manner different from that stated in the privacy policy in effect at the time of collection, we will notify you by e-mail if, and to the extent that, you have provided your e-mail address. If you reply to such an e-mail within a reasonable time and request that we not use your personally identifiable information in the proposed new manner, we will honor your request, but we reserve the right to suspend your access to all or part of the services offered through one or more sites if you do so. If you do not reply to such an e-mail, or we receive a reply of “undeliverable” or similar message from your last known e-mail address, in either case after a reasonable time, we will use the information in the proposed new manner. 

BY USING THIS WEBSITE, YOU AGREE TO THIS CHANGE PROCEDURE. 

**Exceptions**

Notwithstanding anything else in this privacy policy to the contrary, we may collect personally identifiable information and use such information in ways other than those described above if we are required to do so by law or if we deem it advisable in the course of assisting law enforcement activities or protecting our site(s) or other property.
