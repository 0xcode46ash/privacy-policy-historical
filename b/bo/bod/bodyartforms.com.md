The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, you can contact us using [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608153358id_/http%3A//www.bodyartforms.com/contact1.asp). 

We provide two means for you to make a purchase on our site. You can either use our shopping cart or a third party payment option (such as PayPal, Amazon payments, or Google payments). If you use our shopping cart, the transmission of sensitive information collected on our order form is encrypted using secure socket layer technology (SSL). If you choose to use a third party payment option to pay for your order, its privacy statement and security practices will apply to your information. We encourage you to read that privacy statement before providing your information. 

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services.

We utilize Google products which highlight user preferences in order to tweak our advertising to make it more effective. For example, we use Google Remarketing to show relevant products to some users who have purchased similar products, and Similar Audiences to find new audiences who are similar to the audience of our website. We use Audience Analysis to see demographic information about the users on our site. This gives us general information, such as the approximate percentage of users who are between the ages of 18-24. It does not give us any specific user information, and only displays data for groups of tens of thousands of users in a very general way. 

All of these programs are entirely voluntary. You can opt out of any of them, or all of them by adjusting your [Google Ads settings](http://www.google.com/settings/ads). 

  


We may use cookies, for example, to keep track of your preferences and profile information. Cookies are also used to collect general usage and volume statistical information that does not include personal information.

**Web beacons**  
Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used and may be used in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns. 

We use a third party to gather information about how you and others use our Web site. For example, we will know how many users access a specific page and which links they clicked on. We use this aggregated information to understand and optimize how our site is used. 

**Links to Other Web Sites**  
Our Site includes links to other Web sites whose privacy practices may differ from those of Bodyartforms. If you submit personal information to any of those sites, your information is governed by their privacy statements. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy statement of any Web site you visit. 

If you have a complaint about Bodyartforms compliance with this privacy policy, you may contact us through [this page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160608153358id_/http%3A//www.bodyartforms.com/contact1.asp).
