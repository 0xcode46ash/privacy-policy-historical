# Bomis.Com Privacy Policy

  * Bomis doesn't personally care who you are. That's your business. 
  * Notice -- **BOMIS COLLECTS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AT ALL.**
  * If asked by the government about you, Bomis will follow the lead of our great President Clinton and give "misleading but legally accurate" answers. 
  * Choice -- **BOMIS COLLECTS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AT ALL.** If you are a member, we email you a newsletter. If you are not a member, we don't know or even give a fuck in any respect who you are. 
  * Did we mention that we don't personally care who you are? That's your business. 
  * Access -- **BOMIS COLLECTS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AT ALL.** Therefore, you are free to change, alter, delete, update, baste, boil, fry, or catch in a net all the information that we collect, which is, as we say NONE AT ALL. 
  * Spammers are the scum of the earth. Bomis will never give away your email address. We will only email members specifically about their membership (e.g. the monthly newsletter). 
  * Security -- **BOMIS COLLECTS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AT ALL.** Therefore, it is not possible for anyone to steal your personal information. WE DON'T HAVE ANY! 
  * If you want to make your email address available on your ring, you can do that. We personally don't care. That's your business. 
  * Contact -- It is possible to contact Bomis! However, no amount of contact of any kind will make it possible to change anything about how we handle your personal information because, and I think we have been quite clear about this now, **BOMIS COLLECTS NO PERSONAL INFORMATION ABOUT YOU AT ALL.**
  * If you fill out a form or survey on Bomis with personal information then we will simply add up all the results to get some overall feel for who all you people are. We use this information to squeeze money out of advertisers. But we would never reveal specific information about you to advertisers or anyone else. 
  * Bomis reserves the right to recount your pregnant chads. 

  
  
If you still don't understand, then go away.
