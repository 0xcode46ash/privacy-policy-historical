What information are we collecting and how are we collecting it?

Every computer connected to the Internet is given a domain name and a set of numbers, that serve as that computer's "Internet Protocol Address" [ [IP address](http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/I/IP_address.html) ]. When a visitor requests a page from any web site within the Bomgar™ Network, our web servers automatically recognize that visitor's domain name and IP address. The domain name and IP address reveal nothing personal about you other than the IP address from which you have accessed our site. We use this information to examine our traffic in aggregate, and to investigate misuse of the Bomgar™ Network, its users, or to cooperate with law enforcement. [See also Will you disclose the information you collect to outside third parties?] We do not collect and evaluate this information for specific individuals. Our Web servers do not automatically record e-mail addresses of the visitors.
