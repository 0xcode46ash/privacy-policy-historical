**Registration and Billing Information:** We require users of the Site to provide contact information such as their name, e-mail address and company name and, when applicable, billing information such as billing address and credit card number. When one registers for services on the Site (“Services”) or requests more information about the Services, we may also ask for additional personal information such as title, department name or fax number, or additional company information such as annual revenues, number of employees or industry.

Users can opt out of providing this additional information by not entering it when asked.

Arena will automatically send the suppliers a one-time e-mail inviting them to review and provide input on the requesting user’s data.

This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by the Site.

**Security**  
Arena Solutions takes every precaution to protect our users’ information and data against loss, misuse and alteration. As a web-native application, our success will be predicated on the security of that information and data. We use standard industry practices as outlined in our security statement to help prevent unauthorized use of, access to or alteration of user information and hosted data. These practices include the appropriate use of firewalls, SSL encryption, system redundancies, and co-location at a 24/7 secured, controlled environment.

Arena personnel with access to information gathered from users have been advised of the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of such information and of using it only for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.
