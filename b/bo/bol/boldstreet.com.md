BOLDstreet Inc. ( **"BOLDstreet"** / **"we"** / **"us"** ) respects the privacy and personal electronic communication of the users of the BSI Services (as defined below). This Privacy Policy sets forth BOLDstreet’s policy with respect to personally identifiable data ( **"Personal Information"** ) and other information that is collected from users of the BSI Services.

**By providing us with Personal Information, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information to the BSI Services, you acknowledge and agree that such Personal Information may be transferred from your current location to the offices and servers of BOLDstreet and the authorized third parties referred to herein located in Canada, the United States or other countries as indicated by this Privacy Policy from time to time.** You may withdraw your consent to our processing of your Personal Information at any time. However, withdrawing consent may result in your inability to continue using certain features of the BSI Services.

Please note that the BSI Services are intended for adult audiences and BOLDstreet does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from anyone under 13 years of age. Currently, BOLDstreet does not share your e-mail address or other Personal Information, such as name, address, gender or age, with third parties for marketing purposes without your prior consent. In other words, we don’t sell customer lists.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy, the **"BSI Services"** include (a) the Internet services operated by BSI, (b) BSI’s related portal website and other BSI websites (collectively, **"Site"** ) and (c) all software made available by BSI in connection with any of the foregoing. Any new features added to or augmenting the BSI Services are also subject to this Privacy Policy.

What does this Privacy Policy apply to?
    

By using the BSI Services or submitting Personal Information to BOLDstreet, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use the BSI Services. Because our business may change, we reserve the right to update or make changes to this Privacy Policy at any time without prior notice. Please check back from time to time to ensure that you are aware of these changes. This Privacy Policy was last updated on the date indicated above. Your continued use of the BSI Services will signify your acceptance of these changes.

This Privacy Policy does not apply to any Personal Information collected by BOLDstreet other than Personal Information collected through the BSI Services. This Privacy Policy will not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to BOLDstreet through the BSI Services or through any other means. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and BOLDstreet shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

Although the use of non-personal information collected, used or disclosed through the Internet as described herein is not restricted (and to the extent that such is the case, the obligations under this Privacy Policy do not apply to such information), we provide information in this Privacy Policy about the collection of such information for the sake of transparency with respect to the operation of the BSI Services.

How does BOLDstreet use and collect Personal Information?
    

Now, or in the future, BOLDstreet may use your Personal Information to create personalized content, or to tailor services and advertising on or related to the BSI Services to individuals identified as likely consumers to benefit from these products or services. In addition, BOLDstreet otherwise uses the Personal Information you provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Information for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Information in connection with the reason for which it was provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the Personal Information you provide to answer your question or resolve your problem. Also, if you provide Personal Information in order to obtain access to the BSI Services, we will use your Personal Information to provide you with access to such services and to monitor your use of such services. BOLDstreet and its subsidiaries and affiliates may also use your Personal Information and other non-personally identifiable information collected through the BSI Services to help us improve the content and functionality of the BSI Services, to better understand our users and to improve the BSI Services. BOLDstreet and its affiliates may use this information to contact you in the future to tell you about products or services we believe will be of interest to you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will contain instructions permitting you to "opt-out" of receiving future communications. In addition, if at any time you wish not to receive any future marketing communications or you wish to have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as indicated below.

**Usage Statistics.** BOLDstreet may also compile Personal Information and usage statistics such as usage patterns, travel patterns and website page views. BOLDstreet may use this information for statistical purposes to improve the BSI Services and to manage our networks and systems more efficiently. Individual users cannot be identified through these reports.

**Cookies.** BOLDstreet makes use of "cookies," in order to identify returning users and expedite your reconnection to the network. Cookies are files that can contain specific user information, such as User ID, or they can be used to maintain a connection with you during your visit (so that you can visit pages of a site without retyping the same information over and over). BOLDstreet uses cookies to track customer traffic patterns, to maintain a connection during your visit with us, to track your preferences, to diagnose problems on our servers and administer the BSI Services. The BSI Services may make use of a session cookie which expires after a few minutes of inactivity and is automatically deleted from your computer.

**MAC Addresses.** The BSI Services may also record and retain the MAC (Media Access Controller) address from the network card in or used with your computer or other device to enable BOLDstreet to accurately perform billing and administrative functions and otherwise provide the BSI Services.

**Security Measures.** The BSI Services have security measures in place to protect our users, our users' data, and the integrity of our websites and online Products and Services against intrusion and subsequent loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control. BOLDstreet recommends that all users familiarize themselves with their browsers, and learn to identify and understand the differences between secure and regular connections and be aware of the implications of transmitting personal information over an insecure connection.

**Security Limits.** Despite the security measures described above, BOLDstreet strongly recommends that its customers take measures to ensure the security of their data across ANY Internet connection. Like any high-speed service, including DSL and cable, the BSI Services are not inherently secure. We recommend the active use of security solutions such as personal firewalls, anti-virus software, virtual private networks and encryption, though we do not provide these solutions for our users and cannot guarantee their effectiveness. It is the user's responsibility to evaluate their personal needs and workplace requirements, and obtain and properly configure appropriate security measures.

**Tracking Unlawful Use of BSI Services.** On occasion, it may be necessary to record and trace individual usage and/or personal or technical information in order to maintain the integrity and security of the BSI Services. In order to protect our users and maintain a high level of service, BOLDstreet will use commercially reasonable efforts to track and identify any malicious user in contravention of our Terms of Service. To that end, BOLDstreet or its representatives may track and record any information that may be considered evidence of misuse.

**Advertisements:** Advertisements appearing through the BSI Services may be delivered by us or one or more third-party web advertisers. These third party web advertisers may set cookies. These cookies allow the advertisement server operated by that third party to recognize your device each time they send you an online advertisement. Accordingly, advertisement servers may compile information about where or whether you viewed their advertisements and which advertisements you clicked on. This information allows web advertisers to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. The Privacy Policy applies to cookies placed on your device by us, but does not cover the use of cookies by any third-party web advertisers. For the privacy practices of such third-party web advertisers, you should consult the applicable privacy policy for the relevant third-party web advertiser(s).

With whom does BOLDstreet share my Personal Information?
    

BOLDstreet is not in the business of selling your Personal Information. We consider this information to be a vital part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we may share your Personal Information with certain third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:

  * **Business Transfers:** As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar event, Personal Information may be part of the transferred assets. 

  * **Related Companies:** We may also share your Personal Information with the BOLDstreet Related Companies for purposes consistent with this Privacy Policy. 

  * **Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:** BOLDstreet, like many businesses, sometimes hires other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function. 

  * **Legal Requirements:** BOLDstreet may disclose your Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of BOLDstreet, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of the BSI Services or the public, or (iv) protect against legal liability. 



What is BOLDstreet’s policy regarding links to other sites?
    

You should be aware that while you are using the BSI Services you could be directed to other sites that are beyond our control. Because we cannot control the privacy practices of these websites, we recommend reading the privacy policy of the website you link to before you submit any of your Personal Information. The links from the BSI Services do not imply that BOLDstreet endorses or has reviewed such third-party sites.

How long does BOLDstreet keep my Personal Information?
    

We will keep your Personal Information for as long as it remains necessary for the identified purpose or as required by law, which may extend beyond the termination of our relationship with you. We may retain certain data as necessary to prevent fraud or future abuse, or for legitimate business purposes, such as analysis of aggregated, non-personally-identifiable data, account recovery, or if required by law. All retained personal information will remain subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you request that your name be removed from our databases, it may not be possible to completely delete all your Personal Information due to technological and legal constraints.

How do I ask a question, obtain a copy of my Personal Information or file a complaint?
    

To keep your Personal Information accurate, current and complete, please contact us as specified below. We will take reasonable steps to update or correct Personal Information in our possession that you have previously submitted via the BSI Services.

If you want to verify the accuracy of the Personal Information we hold about you and to have a general account of our uses of that information, you may request the same in writing (see further Contact Details below) and we will provide you with a copy of your Personal Information although in certain limited circumstances, we may not be able to make all relevant information available to you such as where that information also pertains to another user. In such circumstances we will provide reasons for the denial to you upon request. We will endeavour to deal with all requests for access and modifications in a timely manner.

**Contact Details.** If you have any questions or complaints about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [privacy@boldstreet.com](mailto:privacy@boldstreet.com); or by regular mail at BOLDstreet, Inc., Attn: Privacy Officer, to Boldstreet’s main offices located at 290 Picton Avenue, Suite 103, Ottawa, Ontario K1Z 8P8, Canada.
