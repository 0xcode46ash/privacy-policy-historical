We built Bolmol to make it easy to share information with your friends and people around you. We understand you may not want everyone in the world to have the information you share on Bolmol; that is why we give you control of your information. Our default privacy settings limit the information displayed in your profile to your networks and other reasonable community limitations that we tell you about. 

  * You need a Bolmol Account to use Bolmol. Bolmol asks for some personal information when you create a Bolmol Account, including your email address and a password, which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A Bolmol Account allows you to access many of our services that require registration.
  * As an Bolmol member, you can create a profile or Bolmol community that includes personal information, such as your gender, age, occupation, hobbies, and interests, plus other content, such as photos. This information may be accessed and viewed by other Bolmol members, as determined by your privacy settings.
  * When you invite new members into your network or send messages through Bolmol, we collect and maintain information associated with those messages, including email addresses and content.

  
Uses and Information Sharing

  * Bolmol maintains and processes your personal information and content of your communications in order to provide your Bolmol account, access to that account, and use of Bolmol services, in addition to the purposes described in the Bolmol Privacy Policy. Your profile information is displayed according to the preferences you set in your account.
  * When you send messages through Bolmol, your name and email address will be identified in the message. We also use your name and email address to notify you of new members, messages, or other information, such as invitations to join friends' networks, new testimonials.
  * If you invite another person to join Bolmol, we use the name and email address you provide us to contact that person and, if necessary, remind that person that he or she has been invited to join Bolmol.
  * Friends or other persons who know your email address can use that address to look up whether you have an Bolmol profile registered under that email address and which Bolmol profile has been created under that email address.
