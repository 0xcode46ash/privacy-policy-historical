The words “you” and “your” refer to the users of the Services, and to any successor in interest of any such user, including individual users of the service who access the service through a merchant who has executed our Merchant Terms of Service (a “Bolt Merchant”) and the Bolt Merchant itself. This Policy does not apply to websites and services that are owned and operated by third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and does not contemplate, any uses of information collected, stored, or shared by a Bolt Merchant. You should consult the privacy policy of the applicable Bolt Merchant if you have questions about their collection or handling of your information.

_Information We Collect_

As you use our Services, we collect certain information about you and the Services you use. The information we collect falls into three different categories: (1) information you give us; (2) information we collect from you automatically when you use our services; and (3) information we collect from other sources.

_**Information You Give Us**_

We collect information you give us when you use our Services. Some examples of using our Services are when you visit one of our websites, create an account, purchase goods or services using Bolt’s checkout service, or participate in a survey or promotion. The information you give us may include end-user behaviors on a merchant site, products they add to a cart and/or purchase, and other cart details, and any other information you choose to give us through a merchant’s checkout that uses Bolt technology.

_**Information We Collect When You Use Our Services**_

When you use our Services, we may collect information about the services you use and how you use them. This information includes:

  * > Purchasing Information – We may collect information about the products you buy, including where you buy products, how frequently you buy products, and the rewards earned due to a purchase.



  * > Device and Website Use Information – When you use a computer, tablet, smartphone or other device to access our websites or purchase products or services via our online properties, we may collect information about the device and how you use it. This information may include the type of device, your operating system, your browser (for example, whether you used Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, Chrome or another browser), versions of the same, your internet service provider, your domain name or the domain name or identity of the Bolt Merchant with whom you transacted using the Services, your internet protocol (IP) address, your device identifier (or UDID), the date and time that you accessed our Service, the website that referred you to our website, the web pages you visited, and the date and time of those requests.

We may also collect such information through a third party web analytics tool.

  * > Location Information – When you use a smartphone or other mobile device to access our Services or use a computer to access the Site, we may collect information about your physical location. We may combine this information with other location-based information, such as your IP address and billing or postal code in our records. We share your location information only with companies that help us provide you with Services and help us understand how the Services are being used, such as an analytics provider.




_Information We Collect From Other Sources_

We also collect information that is publicly available. For example, we may collect information you submit to a blog, a chat room, or a social network like Facebook, Twitter or Google+. We may also collect information about you from other companies and organizations. We use this information primarily for security and fraud detection purposes.

_How We Use the Information We Collect_

We may use the information we collect about you in a variety of ways, including:

  * > to process your purchases of products and services;

  * > to communicate with you about orders, purchases, services, accounts, programs, and offers;

  * > to respond to your customer service inquiries and requests for information;

  * > to inform you about our brands, products, or events;

  * > to maintain and improve our sites and the products and services we offer;

  * > to detect, prevent, or investigate security breaches or fraud; and

  * > to maintain appropriate records for internal administrative purposes.




_How We Share the Information We Collect_

  * > When You Give Consent – We may share information about you with other companies if you give us permission or direct us to share the information.

  * > When the Information Does Not Identify You – We may share your information in a way that does not identify you. For example, we may combine information about you with information about other people on an aggregate, anonymous basis and share the combined information in a way that does not link your information to you.

  * > When We Work Together – We may share the collected information between Bolt, its subsidiaries, and affiliated companies for proper management and analysis and decision making, including decisions regarding the expansion and promotion of our product and service offering, order or customer request fulfillment, and for use by those companies for the other purposes described in this Policy.

  * > When We Work with Service Providers – We may share your information with service providers that provide us with support services, such as credit card processing, website hosting, email delivery, location mapping, postal mail processing and delivery, and analytics services. We require the companies to refrain from collecting, using and disclosing your information except when they are performing work for us or when the disclosure of your information is required by law.

  * > When We Work on Business Transactions – If we become involved with a merger or another situation involving the transfer of some or all of our business assets, we may share your information with business entities or people involved in the negotiation or transfer.

  * > When Sharing Helps Us Protect Lawful Interests – We may disclose your information if we believe that the disclosure is required by law, if we believe that the disclosure is necessary to enforce our agreements or policies, or if we believe that the disclosure will help us protect the rights, property, or safety of Bolt or our customers or partners.




_How We May Allow Others to Collect Your Information_

We allow third parties to collect this information on our websites for the following purposes:

  * > To Collect Information on How Our Websites and Services Are Used – We allow certain service providers to use the information collected on our websites and services to help us learn about our audience and how people use our websites. The companies that use this information for this purpose do not match the information to individual users. In other words, statistical information collected by third parties regarding website usage or performance is not matched or linked to you. We use such information and these third party services to maintain and improve our Services offerings to you and to other users.

  * > Bolt Merchants may have access to your information on their Merchant dashboard or through our Application Programming Interface so that they can properly provide their own services to you.

  * > Bolt reserves the right to inform end users about certain third party products and services, and to share your information with such third parties if you express an interest in buying their products or services. As of the date of this policy we do not share user data with third parties other than those who help us provide our services.




_Cookies, Web Beacons and Similar Technologies_

We and others may use a variety of technologies to collect information about your device and use of our services. These technologies include cookies and web beacons.

Cookies are small data files that are sent from a website’s server and are stored on your device’s hard drive either for only the duration of your visit ("session cookies") or for a fixed period of time ("persistent cookies").

We mainly use cookies for the following purposes:

  *   * > Website Functionality – Some cookies (considered "strictly necessary") are required to allow you to access and use our websites. Without these cookies, our websites do not work properly.

They show us how visitors interact with our website, whether there are any errors, which pages are not used often, which pages take a long time to load, which pages users tend to visit and in what order. These cookies do not collect any information that could identify you and are only used to help us improve how our website works and understand user interests.
