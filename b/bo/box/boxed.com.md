Upon notification to the Company, you can opt-out of these emails or other notifications at any time.

This data is analyzed periodically to help us create a more user-friendly, improved shopping experience within the app. 

## COOKIES

In order to improve your shopping experience and to save user’s time, like other websites, we use “cookies” to collect certain information by automated means. A cookie is a text file that websites send to a visitor’s computer or other internet-connected device to uniquely identify the visitor’s browser or to store information or settings in the browser. We use these cookies to identify and authenticate visitors and to store information in your electronic shopping baskets, so it can be retrieved later. 

We use a third-party tracking service that uses cookies to provide non-personally identifiable information and we also use third-party tracking service in our Sites.

## INFORMATION WE DO AND DO NOT SHARE

We do not share or otherwise disclose your personal information, except as described herein. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone for any reason. 

We may share the personal information we collect with our affiliates, business partners, ad network vendors and their participants, and other third parties for the purposes described in this Policy, including to communicate with you about products and services, offers, events and promotions that we believe may be of interest to you. From time to time, we employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf (for example: shipping, customer service) and need to share your information with them to provide these products or services to you. However, at all times we restrict who has access to your personal information and take great care to protect your privacy in all regards. We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like publishers, advertisers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. 

Compliance With Legal Requirements. We also may disclose information about you (i) if we are required to do so by law or legal process (such as a court order), (ii) in response to a request by law enforcement authorities, or (iii) when we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity, or a violation of the Terms and Conditions that govern use of the Sites. We also reserve the right to transfer personal information we have about you in the event we sell, merge or transfer all or a portion of our business or assets. 

## HOW INFORMATION IS PROTECTED AND CHECKOUT SECURED 

Personal information within user accounts, including purchase history, is protected by a password for your privacy and security. The Company employs numerous administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to assist in protecting the personal information we collect against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We use industry standard firewalls and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption to protect sensitive billing information during the authorization process. When you enter your credit card information during our checkout and billing process, although we store that information for ease of future use, it is encrypted for your privacy. 

Company further suggests that all users safeguard their own account username and password and not share that information with anyone. It is preferable that users update their password periodically and follow conventions for choosing a secure password. If users are concerned about misuse of their identity within the Sites, or are using a shared device, users should make an effort to log out as often as necessary. Company will never ask for your password via email and users should report any such inquiry. 

Note. The Company meets or exceeds the standards generally accepted by the industry within which it operates in regards to the protection of personal information. However, no electronic transmission of information can be executed with absolute certainty that a failure or breach will not occur. Company cannot guarantee that the security measures in place to safeguard personal information will never be defeated or fail, or that those measures will always be sufficient or effective. 

## MINORS

The Company does not direct its Sites to children under the age of thirteen. You must be eighteen years of age or older to register with the Company. We do not knowingly collect information from minors. If we learn that a user is under eighteen years of age, we will promptly delete any personal information that they have provided to us. 

## CHANGES IN POLICY

The Company may amend this Policy from time to time. Use of information we collect now is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the time such information is used. You acknowledge that this Policy is part of the Terms and Conditions and you unconditionally agree that using our Sites is an implicit agreement to the terms of this Policy and those contained in the Terms and Conditions. 

In the event of a change, the revised policies or terms and conditions will be posted immediately. If we make substantial changes to this Policy, we will notify our customers through a more prominent notice (including directly, via email, website or in-Site messaging).
