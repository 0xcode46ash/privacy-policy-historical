# Box Tops for Education > Your Privacy

At General Mills, we take your privacy and your privacy concerns very seriously. That is why we have adopted the following privacy policy explaining our online information collection practices on the Box Tops for Education program Web site and the choices you can make about the way information is collected and used.

What Information We Collect  
General Mills' Box Tops for Education program Web site (the "Site") collects information in two ways: through the use of cookie technology and through information you may provide to us through a voluntary, opt-in process.

Cookies  
General Mills employs cookie technology and similar devices on the Site to facilitate site navigation and personalization. General Mills also uses cookies and similar devices to collect non-personal information about users of the Site, such as: (1) a user's IP address (i.e., princeton.edu), the type of web browser (i.e., Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Explorer) and operating system (i.e., Windows or Linux) being used, (2) the pages of the Site a user visits, and (3) other Web sites visited after a user leaves the Site. General Mills collects this information in order to monitor usage of the Site and to improve aspects of the Site. Cookies do NOT contain any personally identifiable information such as your name or your e-mail address. We may share some or all of this user information with partners, advertisers and others but only in aggregate form, not in a manner that would allow personal identification of any specific user.

Cookies may also be useful tools for you. Cookies can make it possible for you to avoid logging in every time you return to this Site and can personalize the Site to you. Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but can be configured not to do so or to notify the user when a cookie is being sent. 

What Types of Personally Identifiable Information Do We Collect?  
Personally identifiable information is any information that would reveal specific information about you as an individual. Examples of personally identifiable information include your name, street address, e-mail address, gender, school affiliation, and date of birth. General Mills only collects this type of information when you provide it to us voluntarily. Areas of our site may ask you to answer general survey questions. Your answers help us to better understand our consumers generally, and may also help us improve your own experience with our site and provide you with more targeted and helpful information.

Our Commitment to Your Child's Privacy   
Although this Site is intended for use primarily by parents, coordinators and school faculty, General Mills is committed to safeguarding the privacy of your child if he or she visits our Site. Because of this, we require users to verify that they are at least 18 years old before submitting any personally identifiable information. General Mills will not knowingly solicit, collect or disclose personal information about users under the age of 18 without prior parental consent, except as required by law. 

When General Mills Would Provide Other Parties with Personally Identifiable Information  
General Mills is committed to keeping your personally identifiable information secure and will take reasonable steps to protect your personal information from misuse or alteration. 

If you have opted-in to receive information regarding General Mills products, its partners or other promotions, General Mills may use your personally identifiable information in conjunction with the activities of those products or promotions, including, but not limited to, sending newsletters and other information regarding offers that may be of interest to you. Each time General Mills contacts you, you will be given the opportunity to remove your e-mail address from our distribution list. 

General Mills may be required to provide your personally identifiable information to third parties if requested by law enforcement agencies or if General Mills is required to do so by law through a subpoena, court order, or through a government entity. General Mills may disclose personal information to third parties if General Mills has reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact or bring legal action against someone who may be violating General Mills' Terms of Use for this Site or the Official Rules for the Box Tops for Education program. 

Additionally, General Mills may provide your information to third parties who provide services to General Mills. These parties are required to keep such information confidential and may only use the information in conjunction with the services they provide for General Mills. 

Links to Other Sites  
This Site may contain links to other websites that are owned and operated by third parties. General Mills is not responsible for the privacy or confidentiality practices or the content of such websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policies of each site you visit. 

Our Commitment to Data Security  
To prevent unauthorized access to user information, maintain data accuracy and ensure the proper use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. 

Agreeing to Terms  
If you do not agree to this privacy policy, the Official Rules for the Box Tops for Education program, or the Terms of Use posted on this Site, please do not use this Site or any services offered by this Site. General Mills reserves the right to make periodic changes in this policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any updates or changes in this policy. Your use of the Site indicates acceptance of this privacy policy.
