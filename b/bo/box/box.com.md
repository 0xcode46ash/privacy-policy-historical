**What information does Digimedia capture about visitors to its web site?**

The Digimedia web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to one of our web sites) type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address. (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor's email address.

**Does Digimedia ask for personal information?**

Several areas of this web site and other Digimedia web sites may ask for personal information. In these areas, your name, address, email address, billing information, and personal or business profile may be requested and/or required. This information is collected to help us further develop our services, to provide you access to valuable Digimedia Internet-based information and services, and to bill you for those services if you elect to use them.

**How does Digimedia use the information?**

The information collected through this web site and other Digimedia web sites helps us identify the type of web site content our customers value most. We use this information to market and improve the web site and our services. We may also use this information to send you email notifications about updates to the web site, and to contact you by other means for marketing and other purposes. Our policy is to not give, sell or otherwise distribute the information collected through this site to third parties outside of Digimedia and its subsidiaries (unless required by law); provided, however, in some cases we may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using or otherwise processing for our benefit the information obtained through this site. Our practice is to require our suppliers to conduct such activities consistent with this policy and our requirements.

**What happens when I leave a Digimedia web site?**

Parts of this web site and other Digimedia web sites may consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave this web site or other Digimedia web sites to visit one of these linked web sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from this web site or another Digimedia web site (the referring address). This practice allows the third-party to monitor its own web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. Digimedia is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a web site, is placed by the web server into the browser's application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the web site to "recognize" you as a unique individual.

**Does Digimedia use cookies?**

Cookies are used to achieve two goals. The first is to provide Digimedia with the capability to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow Digimedia the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles. For example, through the use of cookies, Digimedia can "remember" your user ID when you login to this web site or other Digimedia web sites on your computer.

**Can cookies be removed from my hard drive?**

Yes, cookies can be removed from your hard drive. Also, depending on what type of web browser and what browser version you are using, you may be able to change the properties on your cookie file so that cookies are not used or saved. Please check with your browser provider for more information on removing cookies.
