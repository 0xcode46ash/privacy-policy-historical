# Boxbe: Privacy Policy

We recommend reading this Privacy Policy and reviewing it periodically. This policy applies to all of the services offered by Boxbe. If this policy is updated, a notice will appear on your **[Boxbe Dashboard](https://web.archive.org/overview) ** page and remain there until you delete it. Boxbe and you are both subject to the terms of this privacy policy as part of the [Terms of Service (TOS)](https://web.archive.org/terms) whether or not you have read the latest version. Please email [feedback@boxbe.com](mailto:feedback@boxbe.com) with any questions or suggestions. 

### Boxbe's Commitment to Privacy

Boxbe takes the privacy of our members seriously, and recognizes that doing so is critical to the success of our business. Boxbe has made and will continue to make significant efforts to protect the identity and personal information of our members.

### When Boxbe Discloses Personal Information

Boxbe never shares your real name, street addresses, mobile number, real (or "private") email addresses, or any other personally identifying information (PII) with any outside party unless we are required to by law or you give us explicit permission. One example of where we are required to share some PII with a third party is when you fund your account through our third-party payment processor. 

If Boxbe shares your profile, interests, or preferences (together "profile") with advertisers or any other outside party, Boxbe first strips your preferences of any means of identifying you personally. Boxbe will not share Preferences even in this form without first obtaining your permission. When we share Preferences, outside parties are given only a special email "alias" as a means of accessing you or uniquely identifyng your Preferences. This "alias" is generated randomly, is different from your username (and from your public forwarding address), and is designed for the purpose of hiding PII. 

Boxbe uses a third-party transaction processor to permit you to move funds to Boxbe and to permit Boxbe to send funds to you. To meet the requirements of our processor and the laws that govern these transactions, Boxbe may be required to share personally identifying information with the payment processor. If so, we will limit the information we share solely to what is required. 

### Why We Collect Personal Information

The personal information you provide in the form of your profile and preferences helps improve the quality of messages you receive. See the [FAQ](https://web.archive.org/help) to learn more about why we collect personal information.

### How We Collect Personal Information

We collect information about you through a series of online 'forms'. When you use our website and submit these forms, the information you provide is transmitted to Boxbe and stored on Boxbe's servers. You must personally provide this information to Boxbe in order for Boxbe to receive it. 

### How We Protect Your Personal Information

In addition to our policy of not sharing any personally identifying information (PII) with third parties and anonymizing what we do share, Boxbe takes precautions with the ways personally identifying information (PII) is stored and accessed. We implement techniques considered industry best-practices and may use additional techniques specific to Boxbe: 

  * we limit the number of people who have access to PII
  * we log and track modifications made to PII
  * we store PII on secure servers which are routinely updated



### Other Information We Collect

Boxbe records information about member and non-member access to Boxbe's services. For example, Boxbe records the IP addresses of computers that access the Boxbe web site. Boxbe does not share this information with third parties, and currently uses this information solely to understand how our services are used so that we can improve them.
