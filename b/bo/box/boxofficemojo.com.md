**_Privacy Statement for _Box Office Mojo_  
_** _Box Office Mojo_ has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to the privacy of our members and web site visitors. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website: _Box Office Mojo_. 

The information that we collect depends on the page you are visiting, the activities in which you elect to participate and the services provided. You can visit many pages on our site without providing any information. Other pages may prompt you to provide information, such as when you register for access to portions of our site, sign up for an account, participate in polls, provide feedback, or request interactive features that are present on our site. (e.g., games, chat rooms, forums, message boards, new groups). **Do not provide false information to access any portion of our site**. 

With regards to information that you choose to provide on our site, we encourage you to be careful and responsible. Should you choose to voluntarily disclose any personal information on our site be aware that such information can be viewed publicly and can be collected and used by third parties without our knowledge and may result in unsolicited messages from other individuals or third parties. Such activities are beyond our control and this policy.

We also collect information automatically and through the use of electronic tools that may be transparent to you. We may log the name of your Internet Service Provider, IP address, or use "cookie" technology to assist us with enhancing your experience on our site, including but not limited to troubleshooting our web site or server (which may require third party technical support), site administration, using cookies to store your user name and password, sparing you from having to re-enter that information each time you visit, or to control the number of times you encounter a particular advertisement while visiting our site. As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but be aware that doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the site or may require you to re-enter your user name and password. Additionally, refusing cookies may prevent us from being able to customize the site's features according to your preferences. 

**_Third Party Sites_**  
We expect our partners, advertisers and third party affiliates to respect the privacy of our users. However, third parties, including our partners, advertisers, affiliates and other content providers accessible through our site, may have their own privacy and data collection policies and practices. For example, during your visit to our site you may link to, or view as part of a frame on our page, certain content that is actually created or hosted by a third party. Also, through our site you may be introduced to, or be able to access, information, web sites, advertisements, features, contests or sweepstakes offered by other parties.

If you are asked to provide information on one of these Web sites, we encourage you carefully to review their privacy policy before sharing your information. 

**_Advertisers  
_** As you access our site, our advertisers, promotional partners or other third parties may use cookies or other technology to attempt to identify some of your preferences or retrieve information about you. For example, some of our advertising is served by third parties and may include cookies that enable the advertiser to determine whether you have seen a particular advertisement before to develop target advertising data. Through features available on our site, third parties may use cookies or other technology to gather information. Although these activities will appear to be coming from our site, they are actually coming directly from the third parties. We do not control the use of this technology or the resulting information and are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.

We may disclose your information in response to a court order, to enforce our [terms of use](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/about/termsofuse.htm), at other times when we believe we are reasonably required to do so by law and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities.
