# Box.net / privacy policy

****

We at Box.net believe strongly in the right to privacy of our customers. We have developed the following privacy policy to protect our customers and inform everyone how we will use personal information. This policy covers the site [ www.box.net](http://www.box.net/) 

**Information Collected**

Box.net collects personal information during registration. We will typically ask for your name and a valid email address. We may use this information to contact customers in order to discuss the services that we provide. We may also email customers regarding updates to our services.

In addition to required registration information, we may conduct surveys which ask customers to volunteer information to be used on an aggregate basic for market research and product development. This information will be used to better tailor our products and services to the needs of our customers. You are not required to volunteer the information requested in these surveys. 

**Cookies**

Cookies are small files that are sent from your web browser and stored on your computer's hard drive. These tell us whether you have used our site previously and allow us to remember some of your preferences. We use cookies solely in order to improve our service to you. We do not use cookies that will obtain other information about you.

**Use and Sharing of Information**

Box.net reserves the right to share aggregated demographic information about our customers, sales, and traffic to our partners and advertisers. We will not give, sell, rent, share, or trade any of your personally identifiable information, or the data that you store using our service to any third party, except as outlined in our Terms of Service and in this privacy policy. We reserve the right to disclose such information to a third party only if (a) we have your express written consent, (b) we reasonably believe we are compelled by applicable state and federal laws, or (c) we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires disclosure of the information without delay. 

Box.net uses a third party vendor to manage all credit card processing, and may partner with other parties to provide specific services. Upon registration with Box.net, we will share names and other contact information as necessary for the applicable third parties to provide these services. These parties are not permitted under their contract with us to store, retain, or use your information for purposes not directly involved with their service to Box.net.  Specifically, our contracts with such third parties prohibit the third parties from using your personal information for purposes of marketing or promotions. 

**Security**

User data is protected with SSL encryption for transmission to Box.net. No customer information is stored on Box.net employees' personal computers. Only employees who require your personally identifiable information to perform a specific task are granted access to such information. The servers on which all customer data and information is stored are kept in a secure environment.

Loss of Privacy

To date, we have never had a situation in which to our knowledge any of our users' personal information has been compromised in any way, or in which any user's personal information has become public. Should any such situation arise, we commit to notify you as soon as we can and take all reasonable steps to correct or ameliorate the situation.
