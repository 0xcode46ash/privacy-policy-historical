**Web Products PTY Ltd  
WEB SITE PRIVACY POLICY**

Web Products PTY Ltd, (referred to in this document as "COMPANY" or "We"), is concerned that its reputation, and the responsibilities that come with using it, always remain of paramount importance in all of Web Products PTY Ltd's activities. To that end, in addition to certain conditions and restrictions that you will find under the Terms of Use Agreement [insert hyperlink here] and our Legal Disclaimer [insert hyperlink here] on our Internet Web Site, the information and links to other web sites provided below explain Web Products PTY Ltd's policy about privacy, options you can use to limit the use of information about you both here and elsewhere on the internet, valuable information about the internet generally, public policy issues about the internet and internet privacy as well as other information about rights and responsibilities concerning privacy in a variety of non-internet areas.

We believe your business is no one else's. Your privacy is important to you and to us. So we'll protect the information you share with us. To protect your privacy, Web Products PTY Ltd follows standard principles in accordance with worldwide practices for Customer/Member privacy and data protection.

**PRIVACY POLICY**  
Web Products PTY Ltd's policy is to respect the privacy of all of our visitors, so the following policy statement tells you about what information we may receive, send or ask of you, what its used for and ways you can control its use.

Generally, anyone can come to visit BobinOz.com, and Web Products PTY Ltd will not keep information about these visits except for a record of how many total visits have been made to the Web Site and its various web pages altogether (not how many times any single person has visited). 

However, if you become a Customer/Member (see our Terms of Use Agreement [insert hyperlink here] for a detailed explanation), which requires giving identifying information to Web Products PTY Ltd (together referred to in this document as a "Customer/Member "), Membership records will be started according to information you give us or that we receive from or send to your computer. 

**SECURITY**

Web Products PTY Ltd has taken strong measures to protect the security of your personal information and to ensure that your choices for its intended use are honoured. We take strong precautions to protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction. Your Personal Information is stored on secure servers that are not accessible by third parties. We provide you with the capability to transmit you Personal Information via secured and encrypted channels if you use a similarly equipped web browser.

These security measures are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration. 

In the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.  
Web Products PTY Ltd strictly protects the security of your personal information and honours your choices for its intended use. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

Inside the company, data is stored in password-controlled servers with limited access. Your information may be stored and processed in the USA or any other country where Web Products PTY Ltd, its subsidiaries, affiliates or agents are located.

You also have a significant role in protecting your information. No one can share these see or edit your personal information without knowing your user name and password, so do not with others.

**NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN AND TO PARENTS**  
We adhere to the Children's Privacy Act. You must be 18 years of age to join or use BobinOz.com or any of the recommended or linked sites. This site follows the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission (www.ftc.gov). We retain the right to refuse anyone membership in any of our sites. If we learn or have reason to believe that a User is underage according to the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission, we will promptly revoke that User's account and delete any personal information.

**ENFORCEMENT  
**If for some reason you believe Web Products PTY Ltd has not adhered to these principles, please notify us at: bob@bobinoz.com or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to PO Box 1042, Kenmore, QLD, 4069 Australia. We will do our best to determine and correct the problem promptly. Be certain the words Privacy Policy are in the Subject line.

**ELECTRONIC PRODUCT REGISTRATION**  
When you buy and install a new product, we may ask you to register your purchase electronically. When you do, we merge your registration information with any information you've already left with us (we call that information your personal profile). If you haven't previously registered with us, we create a personal profile for you from your product registration information. If you ever want to review or update that information, you can click on Update Profile, and edit any of the Personal Information in your profile. If you haven't already created a membership, we will ask you to do so. This ensures that only you can access your information.

**CUSTOMER OR MEMBERSHIP PROFILES**  
As mentioned above, every registered customer or member has a unique personal profile. Each profile is assigned a unique personal identification username, which helps us ensure that only you can access your profile.

When you register, you create your profile, your username and password. It is your passport to seamless travel across your member area, allowing you to download software and order more plug-in modules without having to fill out registration forms with information you've already provided. Even if you switch computers, you won't have to re-register - just use your Registration ID to identify yourself.

**WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE**  
When you join us, you provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to send you updates about your order, questionnaires to measure your satisfaction with our service and announcements about new and exciting services that we offer. When you order from us, our 3rd party payment processors such as PayPal and 2checkout.com will ask for your credit card number and billing address. They use this information only to bill you for the product(s) you order at that time.

We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, including programming, answering Customer/Member questions about products or services, sending email and processing event registration. We will only provide those companies the information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.

**CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION**  
Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, Web Products PTY Ltd will not share your personal information with any third parties without your consent.  
Web Products PTY Ltd will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:

i. Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on Web Products PTY Ltd or the site; 

ii. Protect and defend the rights or property of Web Products PTY Ltd and its family of Websites; 

iii. Enforce our Terms of Use Agreement [insert hyperlink here]; or 

iv. Act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site.

If your information is lost or stolen, you must promptly notify us if your credit card, user name, or password is lost, stolen, or used without permission. In such an event, we will remove that credit card number, user name, or password from your account and update our records accordingly.

The Site contains links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We also make email services, bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, photo albums, file cabinets and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable User to communicate with others (each a "Communication Service" and collectively "Communication Services") available to you. Please understand that any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION-WHY AND HOW "IP ADDRESSES" ARE USED**   
An IP address is a basic element of the way the Internet functions. It is a number that identifies your computer according to its IP address, and IP numbers are assigned to web sites automatically. IP addresses may also be identified in "header" information on emails. There may also be other services and occasions when IP addresses will appear. Always look carefully at what information may be displayed about you, including your IP address, and if you are unsure or uncomfortable about the appearance of your IP address, do not use that service. 

In addition to being an important part of how computers communicate with each other correctly, IP addresses can be used for other things, as well. In Web Products PTY Ltd's case, IP addresses are collected for smooth operation in administrating our Web Site system, for purposes of collecting the non-personal "grouping" information for use by Web Products PTY Ltd and certain third parties, as discussed above, and to generally monitor the use of BobinOz.com. IP addresses are exchanged many times when you are surfing the web, so, for example, if you select a web page or link within Web Products PTY Ltd, the IP address is recorded by the server by which Web Products PTY Ltd's Web Site is connected to the internet.

For most purposes, your IP address will not be connected with personally identifying information, only the fact of that access to a given place on our web sites gets noted, but who you are individually will be anonymous, even to Web Products PTY Ltd.  However, as with certain information discussed in other parts of this document, IP Address information will be used to help us identify a person if Web Products PTY Ltd, in good faith, believes it important for ensuring proper compliance with our rules and policies, if it appears to be necessary to comply with laws and to protect Web Products PTY Ltd, our members and customers or other third parties.

**PERSONAL INFORMATION-OPTING OUT**   
Web Products PTY Ltd, our affiliates or selected third parties may use personal information you give Web Products PTY Ltd for marketing and promotions. You do not have to let us use this information in that manner. This is called "opting out," and it means you can tell us not to use your personal information for these purposes:

i. Listing you in any Customer/Member directory,   
ii. Receiving information from us about Web Products PTY Ltd and our services and products, or  
iii. Receiving information from third parties selected by us because, for example, your interests seem to match services or products they offer. To opt out, contact bob@bobinoz.com, modify your personal information or cancel your Membership.

In addition, there may be specific opt-out processes available when you enter certain areas of our Web Site, join groups, use services or when other merchandise is offered. When you see such opt-out notices, read them for information on how to opt out at that time. Also, some promotions may ask if you'd like additional information. Choosing to ask for additional information may require transfer of your email address, but if more personal information than that is required, you will be notified prior to such information being transmitted and may opt out by cancelling the request at that time.

**OTHER IMPORTANT COMPANY PRIVACY ISSUES**  
A "Cookie" is a small file sent to and stored in your computer to keep accurate records and customize certain services. In fact, it's become so common that you can almost always expect cookies to be sent to your computer from a wide variety of Internet sites.

For Web Products PTY Ltd, cookies are designed to try to make your visits more personal and helpful according to the ways you use our Web Sites. They tell us the name that a Customer/Member uses at Web Products PTY Ltd and can tailor things like greetings, e-cards and so-forth to make your use of Web Products PTY Ltd feel like you're right at home. They can also tell us, for example, that you focus on particular types of information you need as a Customer/Member, and the cookie may automatically see to it that when you log in you get a message about some new feature in your areas of interest or about other services that fit the way you use Web Products PTY Ltd. Also, sometimes when messages are sent to certain Web Products PTY Ltd destinations, like "customer service," a cookie may be used to help process your message more efficiently and accurately.

However, cookies at Web Products PTY Ltd are never used for storing or accessing important personal information that you alone should control the use of-like your password or your credit card number.

Even though cookies are usually thought to be helpful to web sites and their users alike, not everybody wants them being put in their computer. That's okay, but there are two things you need to know: if you don't have cookies, not everything on your Web Products PTY Ltd visits may be accessible, as efficient or as personable; and, stopping cookies is something we can't do, instead you have to do it in your own computer.

Stopping cookies shouldn't be difficult; however, because cookies are so commonly used and welcomed today, most browsers are set to automatically accept them. Even so, if you look through the settings in your browser, often in "preferences," "setup" or "configuration," you should be able to find a place where you can change the cookies setting, either to tell your browser never to accept cookies, or to tell your browser to notify you if a cookie is about to be sent and give you a chance to accept it or not. In the latter case, you should know that cookies are often just numbered or use some kind of computer term that will not be helpful for you to identify what the cookie is actually for so that you can make a clear choice, but the option is yours. 

**SPECIAL CONCERNS ABOUT HYPERLINKS**  
In this document, there are buttons or underlined words and phrases that you can click on. You will find these all over our Web Site and nearly every other web site you visit throughout the Internet, too. Some of them link to other parts of the same web site, but others will send you to another site unrelated to the web site you were at. This kind of link is called a hyperlink and could send you to a web page a block away or on the other side of the world.

When we use hyperlinks at Web Products PTY Ltd, we try to make sure they are updated and accurate links and that they are compatible with the kinds of visitors we have. However, Web Products PTY Ltd has no control over the business, operations or representations of these hyperlinks to unrelated web sites-and any hyperlinks included on them-and what the destination web pages may contain. Web Products PTY Ltd's Privacy Policy does not cover other such destinations. You should always be careful at other web sites about how they operate and how information is being used. They may have their own policies that differ from Web Products PTY Ltd's, they may send different kinds of cookies and they may gather and use information in very different ways than Web Products PTY Ltd.

We can take no responsibility or protect you on other web sites, so always be careful-not just about things like opting out on advertising, but also about safety and security. Once again, carefully protect personal information about yourself, and be wary of who might get such information, especially the public through chat-rooms, bulletin boards or by email. Not being careful about this can be risky, and because Web Products PTY Ltd can't control these hyperlinked sites or users, and because our own policies and rules don't apply, the risk is on you to decide how, and how not, to use them.

**DO YOU ACCEPT OUR PRIVACY POLICY?**  
By using this Web Site, you are verifying that you agree to, and will abide by, the terms of the Web Products PTY Ltd Privacy Policy. 

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO DO SO, STOP VISITING OUR WEB SITES.

Second, check our privacy policy every once in a while. Certain things may change over time, and we may include new information and privacy policies that will be placed in this document. If you continue to visit Web Products PTY Ltd after any such changes, you will again be verifying that you agree to, and will abide by, the current privacy policy, as it then exists.

**UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY**   
We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on the Site and without any other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.

**QUESTIONS & COMMENTS?**   
Web Products PTY Ltd is always ready to review your questions and comments and we will attempt to give you our best responses. Remember, we have a lot of Customer/Member s and other visitors to respond to, as well, but we will try to reply as promptly and thoroughly as possible.
