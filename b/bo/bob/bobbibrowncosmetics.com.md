# Bobbi Brown Cosmetics - Privacy Policy

When you send personal information to us either to order a [catalogue](https://server2.homecom.com/host67/.catalogue/index.html) or to [shop online](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218103128id_/http%3A//www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/shopping/index.html), we will respect your privacy. The information you provide will not be given to any third party (with the exception of "shop online" information which is processed through Neiman Marcus, see below for more details) or sold to any mailing lists.

 **CATALOGUE ORDER INFORMATION:**

All personal information (name and address) submitted to us by the [catalogue](https://server2.homecom.com/host67/.catalogue/index.html) order form is used only for the purpose of mailing you the catalogue. You will not be placed on any other mailing list and the information will not be made available to any third party. When the information you send us is forwarded to catalogue fulfillment, it no longer resides on our web site server and can not be accessed by anyone trying to "hack" into our site.

**SHOP ONLINE ORDER INFORMATION:**

Any sensitive information (name, address and credit card) you send us when submitting your "[shop online](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218103128id_/http%3A//www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/shopping/index.html)" order is sent [securely](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218103128id_/http%3A//www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/shopping/security/index.html) over the internet from your computer to our web site server. The information can not be intercepted by any third party during this process. See our [security](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218103128id_/http%3A//www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/shopping/security/index.html) page for more information.

Once we receive your personal information for an online purchase, it is forwarded to Neiman Marcus who will be fulfilling all of our "shop online" orders. This information (with the exception of credit card information) will also be retained by Bobbi Brown Cosmetics for customer service purposes. Although orders are processed by Neiman Marcus, your personal information will be kept separate from the normal Neiman Marcus customer database. Your information will only be used to process, track and ship your order. See the [customer service](https://web.archive.org/web/19990218103128id_/http%3A//www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/shopping/service/index.html) page for more information.
