# Welcome to BobEvans.com

|  | 

This privacy policy outlines the steps BobEvans.com has taken to protect the privacy of all our Kid Times visitors and to answer any questions you may have in regard to the privacy of your children while they are visiting the Kid Times portions of the BobEvans.com Web site.

This privacy policy only applies to the information collected online at the Kid Times portions of the BobEvans.com Web site. If you would like to review the privacy policy for the general portions of the BobEvans.com Web site, please [click here](http://www.bobevans.com/website/homepage.nsf/ContentWrapper?ReadForm&DB=homepage.nsf/Pages/Legal+Statement+and+Privacy+Policy?OpenDocument).

**A Note to Parents:**

Because many visitors to the Kid Times portion of our Web site may be children, we take care that our content is appropriate for children. In addition, we employ special measures to help children protect their privacy while online.

**General Browsing:**

BobEvans.com gathers navigational information about where you go on Kid Times. Additional non-personally identifiable information (for example, domain type, browser version, service provider, IP address) may also be collected, which will provide us with information about the use of Kid Times. For example, this information allows us to see which areas of Kid Times are most visited and helps us improve the quality of your online experience (i.e., by allowing us to deliver more of the most desired features and services).

**Collection of Personally Identifiable Information:**

The Birthday Club sign-up is the only place on the Kid Times portions of the BobEvans.com Web site where we collect personally identifiable information. When a parent signs their child(ren) up for the Bob Evans Kid Times Birthday Club, we collect the child's name, parent's name, parent's e-mail address, street address and relevant birth dates.

If a visitor under the age of 13 attempts to sign up for the Bob Evans Kid Times Birthday Club, they will only be asked to provide their birth date and a parent's/guardian's e-mail address. BobEvans.com will then send the parent/guardian an e-mail notice and request that the parent/guardian complete a sign-up for their child. Before the child is registered and can receive the benefits of the Bob Evans Kid Times Birthday Club, the child's parent/guardian must consent to their child's registration by completing a Birthday Club registration form for their child. Whenever a parent/guardian completes the Birthday Club registration for their child, BobEvans.com will send the parent/guardian a confirmation e-mail notification.

We respect the privacy of children, and do not and cannot collect any more personal information about children under 13 than is reasonably necessary to enable them to participate in the activities that we offer at the Kid Times portion of our Web site.

The information provided by children under the age of 13 (birth date and parent's/guardian's e-mail address) is used only to send their parent/guardian an e-mail requesting the parent/guardian to consent to their child's registration by completing a Birthday Club registration form for their child. We do not retain any of the information (birth date and parent's/guardian's e-mail address) provided by children under the age of 13 after that e-mail is sent. In addition, if a parent signs their child up for the Kid Times Birthday Club, we respect a parent's right to have a child's information removed from the Birthday Club at any time. To do so, please send an e-mail to [birthdayclub@bobevans.com](mailto:birthdayclub@bobevans.com) with the child's name and address and your request for removal.

For parents/guardians who have completed their child's Birthday Club registration, they can review the personally identifiable information that they provided about their child online by completing and mailing an Information Release Request, which can be downloaded and printed here (Information Release Request in PDF format) [infoRequest.pdf](https://web.archive.org/contact/dl.asp?option=request). Or, you may request that an Information Release Request form be mailed to you by e-mailing your request and address to [birthdayclub@bobevans.com](mailto:birthdayclub@bobevans.com). Please send your completed and signed Information Release Request form to:

Bob Evans Kid Times   
Marketing Department  
3776 South High Street  
Columbus, OH 43207  


**Use and Disclosure of Personal Information Collected Online:**

The personal information collected on the Kid Times portions of the BobEvans.com Web site is used to administer the Bob Evans Kid Times Birthday Club. For example, we collect birth dates to insure that no one under 13 is attempting to register without parental consent and to confirm eligibility for the Kid Times Birthday Club. Only children 12 and younger can participate in the Birthday Club. Once a child reaches the age of 13, their account is inactivated. Street address is collected so Bob Evans can send a birthday card to the child each year until they reach 12 years of age, and a coupon for a free kids' meal at Bob Evans. During the process of signing up, the city, state, and zip code information will be checked to be sure they correspond with one another to help ensure accuracy.

During the registration process, parents may uncheck the box that would result in adding their e-mail address to the BobEvans.com e-mail list. Unless a parent elects not to have their e-mail address added to this list, BobEvans.com will use this information to send the parents messages about future special Bob Evans offers. If a parent later decides that they no longer wish to receive Bob Evans marketing materials, they can use the unsubscribe feature located on the Bob Evans e-mails or send an e-mail to [birthdayclub@bobevans.com](mailto:birthdayclub@bobevans.com) with their e-mail address and request for removal.

We may use third parties to help us provide services to you and your children, such as administering e-mails and processing the Birthday Club mailings. If personally identifiable information (i.e. name, address, e-mail address) is provided to any of these third parties, we will require that such information be maintained by them in confidence and used only for the purpose it is provided.

You should be aware that we may disclose specific information about you if necessary to do so by law or based on our good faith belief that it is necessary to conform or comply with the law or is necessary to protect the users of our Web site, the site, or the public.

**Cookies:**

BobEvans.com uses a browser feature known as a cookie, which assigns a unique identification to your computer. The cookies are typically stored on your computer's hard drive and used by BobEvans.com to help track your clicks as you navigate through the pages within the Kid Times portion of our Web site. 

**Links:**

For your convenience and enjoyment, the Kid Times portions of the BobEvans.com Web site may contain links to other Web sites. BobEvans.com does not disclose any information received by BobEvans.com to these other Web sites. We do not evaluate and are not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such Web sites. We would urge you to review the privacy policies on each link to ensure you are comfortable with their policies and practices. In addition, none of the links that appear on the Kid Times portion of the BobEvans.com Web site should be deemed to imply that BobEvans.com endorses or has any affiliation with the linked Web sites.

**Changes in Policy:**

For children under the age of 13 for whom parents have given consent, BobEvans.com will send a new notice and request for parental consent if there are material changes in the collection, use or disclosure practices affecting children under the age of 13. Otherwise, if elements of our Privacy Policy materially change, we will post the policy changes in our Kid Times Privacy Policy on this Web site. If you are concerned about how your personal information is used, please visit our Web site often for this and other important announcements from BobEvans.com.
