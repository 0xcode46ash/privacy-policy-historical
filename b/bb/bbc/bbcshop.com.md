### 4\. Will BBCW share my personal information with anyone else?

Generally, we will only use your information within the BBC Worldwide Group of companies (including BBC Worldwide Group companies which are situated outside the European Economic Area ("EEA"), such as Lonely Planet, which is based in Australia) in order to provide the service/product you have requested. We will not pass your information to other members of the BBC Worldwide Group for marketing purposes unless you have consented to this.

We will only disclose your data to third party data processors with your consent or where we need to do so in order to provide a service. The data processors to whom we may pass your data will be BBC Worldwide Group companies and appropriately contracted third parties. Otherwise, we will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or as described in section 7: Offensive or inappropriate content on BBCW's websites below.

BBCW will require all third party data processors to whom your information is disclosed to comply strictly with its instructions and BBCW will require that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes.

Where we share your information with BBC Worldwide Group and third party companies which are situated outside the EEA we will ensure they treat your information with the same protection we do.

If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on a BBCW website, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour, BBCW may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.

Where BBCW reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of the law (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), BBCW may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

If you wish to cancel your registration with any of BBCW's websites, you may do so by following the "unsubscribe" instructions on the relevant website. If you change your profile to opt-out of receiving communications, your record may stay on the system so we can ensure that we do not contact you in the future.

Where you contribute to a BBCW service or website, BBCW will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted.

BBC Worldwide is committed to protecting your personal information when you are using BBCW services. We strive to make our services safe and enjoyable environments for you to use. We have created this separate cookies policy in order to provide comprehensive information about BBC Worldwide’s use of cookies across its website portfolio.

### 2\. Information about Cookies

**What is a cookie?**

A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile device (referred to here as a "device") browser from a website's server and is stored on your device's hard drive. Each website or third party service provider used by the website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser's preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website or third party service provider to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites or other third party service providers. A cookie will contain some anonymous information such as a unique identifier and the site name and some digits and numbers. It allows a website to remember things like your preferences or what’s in your shopping basket.

**What is a browser?**

A browser is an application that allows you to surf the internet. The most common browsers are Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Safari. Most browsers are secure and offer quick and easy ways to delete information like cookies. Please see the section below Updating Your Settings.

**What do cookies do?**

Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse your use of our sites and help us to provide you with a better user experience. For example, you may choose to personalise the content of a website in order to see the latest news and weather for your region. In order to do this, a cookie is placed on your device to remember where you live so that we deliver the information that has been requested by you. This is a prime example of how cookies are used to improve your experience of a website.

**Change your Browser Settings’**

You can choose how cookies are handled by your device via your browser settings. The most popular browsers allow users to a) accept all cookies, b) to notify you when a cookie is issued, or c) to not receive cookies at any time. If you choose not to receive cookies at any time, the website may not function properly and certain services will not be provided, spoiling your experience of the website. Each browser is different, so check the "Help" menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

Back to top

**First Party Cookies**

First party cookies are set by the website you are visiting and they can only be read by that site.

**Third Party Cookies**

Third party cookies are set by other organisations that we use for different services. For example, BBC Worldwide uses external analytics services and these suppliers may set cookies on BBC Worldwide’s behalf in order to report what’s popular and what’s not. The website you are visiting may also contain content embedded from, for example, YouTube or Flickr and these sites may set their own cookies.

**Session Cookies**

Session Cookies are stored only for the duration of your visit to a website and these are deleted from your device when your browsing session ends.

**Persistent Cookies**

This type of cookie is saved on your device for a fixed period. Persistent cookies are used where we need to know who you are for more than one usage session. For example, if you have asked us to remember preferences like your location or your username.

**Flash cookies**

Many websites use Adobe Flash Player to deliver video and game content to their users. Adobe utilise their own cookies, which are not manageable through your browser settings but are used by the Flash Player for similar purposes, such as storing preferences or tracking users.

Flash Cookies work in a different way to web browser cookies; rather than having individual cookies for particular jobs, a website is restricted to storing all data in one cookie. You can control how much data, if any, may be stored in that cookie but you cannot choose what type of information is allowed to be stored. You can manage which websites can store information in Flash cookies on your device via the website storage settings panel on the Adobe website.

**Web beacons, clear GIFs, page tags and web bugs**

These are all terms used to describe a particular form of technology implemented by many websites in order to help them to analyse how their site is being used and, in turn, to improve your experience of their site. They may also be used to target any advertising being served on the web page you are viewing.

A web beacon (or similar) usually takes the form of a small, transparent image, which is embedded in a web page or an email. They are used in conjunction with cookies and send information such as your IP address, when you viewed the page or email, from what device and your (broad) location.

### 4\. How do we use Cookies?

Cookies enable us to identify your device, or you when you have logged in. We use cookies that are strictly necessary to enable you to move around the site or to provide certain basic features. We use cookies to enhance the functionality of the website by storing your preferences, for example. We also use cookies to help us to improve the performance of our website to provide you with a better user experience.

Typically, we use cookies to deliver the following services throughout the pages of our websites:

  * To enable us to recognise your device so you don't have to give the same information repeatedly;
  * To recognise that you may have requested that we remember your username and password so you don't need to enter your details each time you visit the site;
  * To ensure that if you are purchasing a product or service via our websites, your experience is smooth and secure;
  * To record what people like and don’t like on the website and the popularity of various elements of the website so that we can ensure that it works properly at points of high usage. BBCW also uses a number of independent measurement, advertising and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to BBCW sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our website. BBCW uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users.

### 5\. Analytics on our Websites

Coremetrics and Google Analytics provide anonymised statistical information for us. They process IP addresses and information from cookies used on our sites so we know how many page views we have, how many users we have, what browsers they are using (so we can target our resources in the right way to maximise compatibility for the majority of our users) and, in some cases, in which country, city or region they are located.

### 4\. Service & Product Availability

Our site is only intended for use by people resident in the [**Serviced Countries.**](https://www.bbcshop.com/scat/deliveryinformation#wherewedeliverto) We do not accept orders from individuals outside of those countries. Please review our Serviced Countries page before ordering any goods/services from us. There may also be restrictions on certain products for certain international delivery destinations (for example, DVD’s), so please review the information on that page carefully before ordering the products. 

Goods dispatched by BBC Shop to addresses outside of the European Union are generally not subject to VAT.

If you order goods for delivery outside the UK, they may be subject to import duties and taxes which are levied when the delivery reaches the specified destination. You will be responsible for payment of any such import duties and taxes. Please note that we have no control over these charges and cannot predict their amount. Please contact your local customs office for further information before placing your order. 

Please also note that you must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of the country for which the products are destined. We will not be liable for any breach by you of any such laws. 

Delivery times are clearly displayed on the site next to each individual item. If no delivery date is specified, your order will be fulfilled within 30 days of the date of the Dispatch Confirmation, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

If BBCW has insufficient stock to deliver the goods you have ordered, BBCW will not charge your credit card until the date your order is sent to you. BBCW will inform you by e-mail at the address given in your order form and any sum which may have been credited from your credit card will be re-credited to you no later than 30 days after the date of your order. 

Back to top

By placing an order through our site, you warrant (promise) that: 

  * (a) you are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; 
  * (b) you are at least 18 years old; and 
  * (c) the information given on your order form is complete and accurate. 
  * (d) you will keep your password confidential and will be responsible for all of your account activity. If you think that anyone else might have obtained your password, you must change it immediately.

Back to top

All orders are subject to acceptance by us and availability of the requested item(s). After placing an order, you will receive an email from us acknowledging that we have received your order. It will state what the item(s) you have ordered are, the cost (including VAT and postage and packaging) and delivery, invoice and cancellation details. If your order has been unsuccessful, you will be made aware of the reason why and possible explanations. Please note that this acknowledgment email does not mean that your order has been accepted – your order constitutes an offer to us to purchase goods or services. All orders are subject to acceptance by us and we will confirm such acceptance by sending you an email confirming that we have dispatched the item(s) to you (the Dispatch Confirmation). That email shall represent our legal acceptance of the offer you made to purchase the item(s) and the contract between us (the Contract) will only be formed (and we will debit your account) when we send you the Dispatch Confirmation. 

If we confirm to you that some but not other item(s) that you have ordered have been dispatched, those item(s) that have not been dispatched will not form part of the Contract. In the event of any change, such as a change in price or expected delivery date between completion of your order and Contract formation, we shall inform you and you shall at that point have the right to either (i) accept such change (in which case your email reply will represent a new offer which we will accept upon notification of dispatch) or (ii) reject such change (in which case your email reply will represent a withdrawal of your order, or the relevant part of your order as the case may be). If you have already paid for the item(s), we will refund the full amount no later than 30 days after the date of your order. 

Back to top

The goods will be at your risk and responsibility from the time we despatch your parcel for delivery. 

Ownership of the goods will pass to you when we receive full payment of all sums due in respect of the goods, including delivery charges.

Verified by Visa and Mastercard SecureCode are new services that protect your card details with a personal password in order to provide greater security to online shoppers. 

In order for Verified by Visa and Mastercard Secure Code to work, you will need to register your card with a password (which will be known only by you). You only need to do this once, then whenever you use the card to shop online, you will be asked to enter the password during the checkout process. 

If you are not already registered for Verified by Visa or Mastercard Secure Code, you may be asked by your bank to register your card during the BBC Shop online checkout process and you will be directed to your bank's website to do so. If you would like to register your card without placing an order online at BBC Shop, you will need to contact the bank that issued your credit card. 

If you have previously registered for Verified by Visa or Mastercard Secure Code, you will be prompted to enter your password when placing your order online at BBC Shop.
