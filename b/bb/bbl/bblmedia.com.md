[****WWW.DENVERBROWN.COM****](http://www.denverbrown.com/) **   This is my friend George Kieffer's site which he publishes for the benefit of his fellow workers at UPS. I am one of them by the way, and George is my Union Steward. The site is updated monthly, and has been in publication since June, 2003. All past issues are archived online. DenverBrown.Com is steadily getting more and more attention and visitors, and that is due to it's excellent content. If you have ever wondered what it is like to be a UPS Driver, definately have a look at this site. George and I have been UPS Drivers for over 25 years. UPS is the blessing, and the malediction in one BIG PACKAGE!
