Unless you tell us not to, we may also share other information about you with companies within the BB&T Corporate Family for various purposes, such as offering to you, or considering you for, other products, services, or opportunities made available by other BB&T companies.

**How to tell us not to share this information within our Corporate Family**  
If you ask us not to share this information within our corporate family, you may miss learning of financial products and services offered by these companies that might be of benefit to you.

If you prefer that we not share application information and credit-related information obtained from you and others with companies within the BB&T Corporate Family, you may direct us not to share (opt out) by calling us at  
**1-888-800-3420** between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m., Eastern Time, 7 days a week. We will process your request as soon as we reasonably can. If you have already directed us not to share, you do not need to opt out again.

For a joint account (account held by two or more consumers), each of the joint accountholders may exercise the right to opt out. We will treat an opt-out direction by one joint accountholder as applying to all of the joint accountholders with respect to that joint account. For example, if Pat and Kim have a joint account, Pat's opt-out direction will also apply to Kim with respect to the joint account, but not to Kim's individual accounts. Kim may separately exercise the right to opt out as to Kim's individual accounts. In this example, Pat's opt out will also apply to all of Pat's individual accounts.

Note: Your opt out only covers application information and credit-related information obtained from you and others that we might otherwise share within our corporate family. We may continue to share other information about you within the BB&T Corporate Family as permitted by law, such as information about your transactions with us and certain identifying information, including name, address, telephone number, and Social Security number. Each company within the BB&T Corporate Family will continue to contact its consumer clients with offers of its own products and services. You will continue to receive product messages via your statement(s), as well as telephone and mail offers from BB&T companies with whom you have relationships.
