**_About US_.  **

BBToyStore.com is the website owned by BB Novelties, LLC. We are a company based in New Jersey and have been in business since 1999. Although we dabbled selling and helping with a couple of larger companies with collectible/hot items for many years previously before venturing out with our own business.  We started selling collectibles & hard to find items at flea market and collectibles shows. Soon after in 2000 we opened up a Retail store and an Online website, www.BBToyStore.com and a Huge Ebay Auction account (www.bbtoystore.com). Shortly after our website & ebay account became one of the largest known places to buy TY Beanie Babies and Pokemon cards we decided to close our retail store. We bought a large warehouse and run our website & ebay full time and put full attention into it to give you the absolute best service.  

Through the years we have developed the best relationships with the top Wholesalers and Distributors in the industry, so we can offer you the best possible prices around.  Our main expertise are the Hot Items that everyone is searching for in high demand. We have some of the best connections around to get these items and bring them to you.  We have even bought out complete inventories of Dealer and Stores to gain the best possible prices for our inventory

As members of the Better Business Bureau we are proud to offer you the best service from our website. Anything you may need just ask via email [sales@bbtoystore.com](mailto:sales@bbtoystore.com) . We will continue to grow as our inventory gets larger by the week. We are adding new items almost every week.
