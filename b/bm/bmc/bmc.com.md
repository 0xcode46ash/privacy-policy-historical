### Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. This website, www.bmc.com (the " **Site** "), is owned and operated by BMC Software, Inc. (" **BMC** ").

### Data Processor Activities

In certain situations, BMC may obtain incidental access to information about its customers' employees and other end users in the EU and Switzerland in connection with supporting its products or services ("EU/Swiss Processor Information").
