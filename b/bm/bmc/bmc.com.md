# BMC Software - B2B solutions for ebusiness systems management

Your privacy is important to us. When you provide information to us via our web site, we protect it according to this policy. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let us know. 

### Information We Collect Online

BMC Software collects only voluntarily-provided information from users browsing [www.bmc.com](https://web.archive.org/) or any other BMC Software web site, unless another privacy policy is provided on that BMC Software web site. We do analyze our web site logs to collect aggregate data, such as the number of hits per page, and use this data to improve the value of the materials available on our web site. Our web site logs do not identify users and we make no attempt to link them with the users who actually browse our web site. 

We collect various data at certain registration or subscription locations on our web site - obviously, what we collect there depends upon what you enter. This data may be used to enhance your site visit, to assist with technical support issues, to deliver product announcements, or to provide follow-up information after your visit. We also collect other information you send to us, including chat postings and email messages. 

### Use or Disclosure of Information

BMC Software maintains several email lists to keep interested parties informed about our company, events, products, support and more. Users may voluntarily request to join our mailing lists by signing up or opting in through a [form](http://www.bmc.com/subscribe) on our web site. We do not sell the addresses on our list, but we may make available information to specific business partners or sponsors. To be removed from a BMC Software email list, follow the "unsubscribe" instructions on emails from BMC Software. 

When you choose to submit personal information to BMC Software, BMC Software and its affiliates may transfer, process and store the information in countries in which BMC Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including the United States. The United States does not regulate data protection in the same manner as other countries, including the Member States of the European Union. Accordingly, the personal data that you submit to BMC Software may be transferred to, processed, or stored in countries where the data protection laws are different than those of your country of residence. 

We may make any disclosure of material posted to public areas of our web site such as chat rooms, but otherwise, except as stated above, we will not share or disclose information except in the following cases: we may disclose any information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our terms of use and legal notices, or as required or permitted by operation of law or the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law. 

### Access to Information

You can update your contact information by emailing [privacy@bmc.com](mailto:privacy@bmc.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Request) with the subject line heading of "Privacy Policy Request", or by updating the information via a web page. We may keep all information in an off-line form, for archival purposes or as otherwise required by law. Please note that if your information is removed from our databases, you may no longer be able to access certain areas of our web site requiring registration or a subscription. 

### Cookies and Other Issues

We track content usage and traffic on the site by using "cookies," a feature of your browser. Using your browser's tools or options, you can choose never to accept cookies or to be notified when a cookie is sent so that you can reject them some of the time. Note that cookies help you navigate the site, particularly on return visits. If you choose not to accept cookies, you may not be able to find what you want on the site most easily. 

Some areas of our web site pages are password protected, or require that you license BMC Software products or join one of our programs. In other select areas of our web site we may request that you provide us with basic information before accessing that area. If you choose not to register and not to provide this information, you can still use most of our web site. However, you will not be able to access the areas that require registration. 

Please note that anything that you post in any chat room, message board or any similar environment on our web site is not protected. We assume no responsibility for these environments or the information revealed in them. Note that certain links on our web pages will take you off the BMC Software site to web pages operated by third parties. BMC Software will have no control over the information you enter or the cookies your browser accepts while on third parties' sites. You should examine the terms of service and privacy policies of other web pages whenever you leave BMC Software's web site. 

### Security

BMC Software will make reasonable efforts to use the latest appropriate security technologies to ensure that the information its users provide is secure. However, BMC Software would like to remind its users that the Internet is not a secure environment and technology is no substitute for common sense. For this reason, we strongly encourage each user to keep login names and passwords secret and to change passwords when they may have become compromised. Furthermore, we recommend that our users communicate over secure channels wherever possible, disable the automatic login features found in some browsers, and empty their browser caches regularly. See Tools or Options on your browser's menu. 

### Updates and Contact 

We constantly update the features of our web site to better serve you and all our customers, so this policy may also be updated from time to time. BMC Software may modify this policy without advance notice and any modifications are effective when they are posted here. By using our web site, you indicate your understanding and acceptance of the terms of the policy posted at the time of your use. 

If you have any questions, please contact us by sending an email message to [privacy@bmc.com](mailto:privacy@bmc.com) with the subject line heading of "Privacy Policy Request".
