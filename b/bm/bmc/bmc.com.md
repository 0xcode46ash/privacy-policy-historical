BMC Privacy Policy

Web Site Privacy Policy

Our Commitment to Privacy

Your privacy is important to us. When you provide information to us via our web site, we protect it according to this policy. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to let us know.

BMC participates in the Safe Harbor program negotiated by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the European Union's 1995 Directive on Data Protection. More information about the Safe Harbor program and the data privacy and security principles can be found at [www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview](http://www.export.gov/safeharbor/sh_overview.html). The principles are designed to inform people about how personal information they disclose will be used, and to provide people with a certain amount of control over their personal data.

BMC Software operates in the business-to-business (B2B) software industry. Unlike many companies and web sites, we do not focus on consumer users or the collection of consumer data. To the extent we collect information online, our purpose is to better serve our business customers. 

The Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information when you browse [www.bmc.com](http://www.bmc.com/), any other BMC Software web site, or affiliate site:

  * Information you provide directly, such as your name or ordering information when you register or make an online order, or at any BMC interactive message board or e-mail messages you send us;
  * The web pages your Internet browser visits when browsing BMC websites;
  * click-through information related to BMC Software marketing activities; and
  * Aggregate data, such as the number of hits per week or per web page. 



The Way We Use Information

BMC Software does not rent or sell customer information. We use information collected online in the following ways:

  * For information you provide directly, such as ordering information or e-mail messages, we use the information to respond to your orders and requests. 
  * For information you provide online, including actions or clicks from hyperlinks and subscriptions, we use the information to customize future communications and web pages in accordance with communication preferences you have established with BMC Software. 
  * For some registration, email and use data you provide, we may direct you to particular web pages, customize the web pages you see, or otherwise increase the relevance of the information you receive. 
  * For information about web pages visited, page hits per week, and the like, we use this information internally to improve the design of our web pages. 
  * BMC Software may use third-party storage or service-provider companies to perform some functions including the processing of data. Such companies are under a duty of confidentiality to BMC Software. 



When We Share Customer Information

BMC shares customer information for business purposes only on a need-to-know basis and only with: (a) its own employees and affiliates; (b) the customer from which BMC received the information; (c) BMC subcontractors and consultants that have agreed to safeguard such information in a like manner to the way that BMC safeguards such information and that have signed confidentiality agreements with BMC; and (d) other entities authorized to have access to such information under applicable law or regulation. BMC does not share non-public individually identifiable information with third party marketers.

BMC Software may disclose customer information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our terms of use and legal notices, as required or permitted by law, or at the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law.

We will not use or share customer information in ways unrelated to those described above without first notifying you and offering you a choice as to whether or not we may use your data in this different manner.

Our Commitment to Data Integrity and Security

BMC processes customer information only in ways compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. To the extent necessary for such purposes, we take reasonable steps to make sure that customer information is accurate, complete current and otherwise reliable with regard to its intended use. However, BMC expects customers will update their personal information with BMC as necessary.

BMC takes reasonable and appropriate measures to maintain the confidentiality and integrity, and prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure, of customer information. This includes maintaining a system of appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to secure such information.

How You Can Access or Correct Your Information

You can request access to all your personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain, and update or correct that information, through e-mailing [privacy@bmc.com](mailto:privacy@bmc.com) with the subject line heading of "Privacy Policy Request." To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections.

We may keep all customer information in an off-line form, for archival purposes or as otherwise required by law. Please note that if your information is removed from our databases, you may no longer be able to access certain areas of our web site requiring registration or a subscription.

Users may request to be removed from a BMC Software e-mail list, by following the "unsubscribe" instructions on e-mails from BMC Software or by sending a request to [privacy@bmc.com](mailto:privacy@bmc.com).

How We Enforce Our Privacy Policy

BMC will periodically verify our compliance with the principles contained in this privacy policy. Interested persons are encouraged to raise any concerns with us using the contact information below. We will investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes regarding use and disclosure of customer information. In the event that we cannot satisfactorily resolve a complaint through our internal processes, the complaint may be referred to a higher dispute resolution authority. We will cooperate fully with the Federal Trade Commission on behalf of U.S. residents and the Data Protection Authorities of any European Union nation on behalf of its residents. In the event that we or such authorities determine that we did not comply with this principles contained in the privacy policy, we will take appropriate steps to address any adverse effects and to promote future compliance.

Revisions and Contact Information

We constantly update the features of our web site to better serve you and all our customers, so this policy may also be revised from time to time. BMC Software may modify this policy without advance notice and any modifications are effective when they are posted here. By using our web site, you indicate your understanding and acceptance of the terms of the policy posted at the time of your use.
