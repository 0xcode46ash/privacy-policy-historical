# Data privacy statement - BMC Switzerland

The company **BMC Switzerland AG** , based in Grenchen (Switzerland), operates the internet domain bmc-switzerland.com and the services offered there for the companies comprising the entire BMC group (hereinafter referred to as BMC). On this basis, BMC is responsible for the collection, processing, and usage of the user's personal information, as well as for the compliance of said data processing with Swiss law. 

Based on Article 13 of the Swiss Federal Constitution and the federal provisions on data protection (Data Protection Act, [Datenschutzgesetz, DSG]), every person is entitled to protection of their privacy, as well as the protection against the misuse of their personal data. 

As a matter of course, BMC complies with these provisions. Therefore, BMC provides information on the scope and handling of collected and stored data below. 

Use of BMC's website is generally possible without specifying any personal data. However, for certain services, the user will be required to provide some personal information. Personal information BMC collects about users, customers, or prospective customers may include:

  * name
  * address(es)
  * email
  * address(es)
  * phone number(s)
  * personal data, such as gender, size, weight, age, etc.
  * purchase information
  * payment information
  * information about participation in surveys, contests, and events
  * information included in correspondence (letters, phone calls, emails, faxes, instant messaging, etc.)



BMC may also collect information from third party providers to identify prospective customers that may be interested in bikes and bike products. 

Furthermore, by accessing the BMC website, the following clickstream data is automatically stored:

  * IP address
  * date, time
  * general information about the operating system and the browser, as well as their language and country settings
  * information about the usage of BMC's online services (see also 'Web analysis tools' section below)
  * usage data for social network plugins, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, etc. (see also 'Use of social network plugins' section below)



This usage data forms the basis for anonymous statistical evaluations so that trends can be recognised that BMC can use to improve its services accordingly. 

Cookies are small text files that internet browsers automatically store on the user's computer when visiting BMC's website. Cookies neither damage the computer nor do they transfer personal data about the user to BMC, but they do help make the user's visit to the BMC website easier, faster, and more secure in many ways.

Most browsers automatically accept cookies. However, the user can configure their browser to automatically accept or block all cookies, or to request the user's permission each time a site attempts to set a cookie.

It should be noted that certain functionalities on BMC's website might not work properly if cookies cannot be stored.

By using BMC's website, the user accepts the use of cookies.

In order to continuously improve and optimise BMC's online services, so-called web analysis tools are used. Web analysis tools are used by BMC for marketing and analysis purposes. They provide statistics and graphs that generate insights about certain anonymised demographic information, as well as certain usage patterns of BMC's website. 

Web analysis tools are normally external software solutions hosted on the servers of the software provider. Depending on the provider of the web analysis tools, these servers may be abroad. 

The BMC website primarily uses Google Analytics for web analysis. In order to analyse BMC's website usage patterns, data about BMC's website usage is transferred to the Google Analytics servers. 

Further information about Google Analytics' data privacy statement can be found under '[Google Analytics Help: Data privacy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en "Google Analytics Help: Data privacy")'. 

This data collection by Google Analytics can also be disabled by the user. Further information can be found under '[Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en "Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on")'. 

BMC cannot link Google Analytics' anonymised demographic information with the personal data of its own customers.

Personal information is treated as strictly confidential and is not sold to third parties. The transfer of personal information only occurs with the explicit agreement of the user, under legal obligations, or if this is necessary to enforce BMC's rights. In addition, BMC shall only transfer personal information to third parties (e.g. business partners of BMC) – if necessary – in the course of answering queries or performing requested services.

Furthermore, personal information may be disclosed to website hosting companies and web agencies that support BMC with respect to the design, development, analysis, and operation of the website. These companies use this personal information solely for the performance of these specified tasks and shall be bound by non-disclosure agreements. 

BMC shall provide users access to the personal information BMC maintains about them so long as BMC has access to that information in a legible format. BMC shall also work with users to correct any personal information should it be inaccurate, or to delete it completely. It should be noted that for corrections and deletions, a written request must be sent to BMC headquarters in Grenchen (Switzerland), along with appropriate proof of identity.

By registering for a BMC newsletter at [www.bmc-switzerland.com](http://www.bmc-switzerland.com/us-en/ "Home"), the user has agreed for BMC to process their registered personal data for promotion activities, such as sending out emails of a promotional nature, delivering customised advertising, etc. 

The despatch of emails only takes place following a corresponding user request (registration). The user's email address may be used by BMC until the user unsubscribes from the particular email list(s). Unsubscription may take place at any time. Information on unsubscribing is included at the bottom of each email. 

BMC is entitled to engage third parties with the technical processing of promotional activities and to disclose the user's data for this purpose.

Several social network functionalities from different social networks (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, YouTube, Instagram, etc.) are integrated into BMC's website. These functionalities are offered by the respective network providers in the form of so-called plugins. 

By using BMC's website, the user's browser establishes a direct connection with the servers of the respective network providers to initiate the social plugins. By calling the plugins, the network providers will receive the information that the user is visiting BMC's website. If the user is simultaneously logged on to the social network of a network provider with a personal account, the network provider may assign this information to the corresponding user account. If the user additionally interacts directly with the plugins, the corresponding information - and other information, such as IP address, browser type, referring domains, visited pages, mobile operators, device and application IDs, etc. - may be directly sent to the network provider where it will most likely be stored. 

BMC points out that, as the provider of the BMC website, BMC has no knowledge of the content of the data transferred or its use by respective network providers. Because their privacy statements are updated on a regular basis, BMC provides the links to the different regulations for the different network providers:

  * [Facebook Data Use Policy](http://www.facebook.com/about/privacy/ "Facebook Data Use Policy")
  * [Twitter Privacy Policy](http://twitter.com/privacy/ "Twitter Privacy Policy")
  * Google+ - [Google Privacy Policy](http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/ "Google Privacy Policy")
