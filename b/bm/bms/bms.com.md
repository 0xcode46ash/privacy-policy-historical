# Bristol-Myers Squibb: Privacy Statement

Privacy Policy

Effective Date: June 6, 2008

**Purpose of the Privacy Statement**. Bristol-Myers Squibb respects the privacy of visitors to this Web site and understands that information about you, your health, and your health care is sensitive. Except as provided in the Transfer of Control section of this Web siteâ€™s Internet Privacy Statement, Bristol-Myers Squibb will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information.

Bristol-Myers Squibb developed this Internet Privacy Statement to provide information about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information that you may provide when you visit this Web site.

We encourage you to read this Internet Privacy Statement before using this Web site or submitting information. By using this Web site, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to the terms of the Internet Privacy Statement.

**Information Voluntarily Provided by Users**. You can visit much of the Web site without telling us who you are or providing us with other personally identifiable information. Some areas of the Web site allow you to contact us to ask questions or provide comments. When you communicate with us and request a response, we ask for your name and contact information. We intend to let you know how we will use such information before we collect it from you; if you tell us that you do not want us to use this information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your requests, we will respect your wishes.

Some areas of the Web site may also require that you submit information in order to access specific content, features, interactive tools, services or participate in a particular activity. For example, to create an online account or to subscribe to a newsletter, we may ask for your name, contact information, and perhaps additional information so we can tailor our response to your request.

In addition, when you access certain interactive tools or services, you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information. You may always choose not to provide the required information, but then you may not be able to participate in the particular activity that requires the information.

**Use and Disclosure of Your Personally Identifiable Information That You Provide Voluntarily**. We may personalize and customize this Web site for certain visitors.

If you provide information about yourself via a contact form, you may find it customized with references to products and/or services that we believe may be of interest to you, based on your previous interactions and information you have provided to us.

If you do provide us with personally identifiable information, such as your name, postal address, e-mail address, telephone number, or other information such as your education level, or personal medical information, you agree that we may contact you through a variety of means such as postal mail, phone, or e-mail to provide you with information we believe may be of interest to you unless you opt out of this service by contacting us as indicated below.

If you opt-in to the Bristol-Myers Squibb program, we may share your information with one of our other Bristol-Myers Squibb companies who might invite you to participate in one of their programs.

If you do not opt out of this service, we may also share this information with providers of services to Bristol-Myers Squibb who help Bristol-Myers Squibb to develop programs and provide services that may be of interest to you, or for information processing, mailing, and/or Internet-based delivery purposes.

Except as provided in the Transfer of Control section, Bristol-Myers Squibb will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information. In addition, as stated in the Transfer of Control section, your personally identifiable information may be shared with actual or potential parties to a contemplated transaction where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of a business or a line of our business, without obtaining your consent or any further notice to you. In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that personally identifiable information submitted through this web site will be protected appropriately.

**Use and Disclosure of Non-Personally Identifiable Information**. Bristol-Myers Squibb will not treat as confidential any information that you provide that is not personally identifiable, such as questions, comments, ideas, or suggestions. You should be aware that Bristol-Myers Squibb will be free to disclose through any means and use for any purpose such information in its sole discretion.

By providing such information to Bristol-Myers Squibb, you understand and agree that no relationship has been created between Bristol-Myers Squibb and you, and Bristol-Myers Squibb has no obligation to you whatsoever regarding that information.

**Update and Correction of Personally Identifiable Information**. You may contact us to update or correct much of your personally identifiable information that you provide to us through the Web site other than the limited information described below under the Regulatory Requirements section, or to opt-out from our mailings and other services that you may have signed up for. To do so, please contact us at (877) 274-0626.

**Security**. We take reasonable precautions to maintain the protection of personally identifiable information collected through this Web site and used in accordance with this Privacy Statement. In addition to technical safeguards, we also use physical controls and procedures to safeguard your personally identifiable information. However, we cannot guarantee that it is completely secure from people who might attempt to evade our security measures or intercept transmissions over the Internet.

**Use of Cookies**. We may store some information on your computer using a technique your browser supports called "cookies". The cookies are used for a variety of purposes, including but not limited to helping you login (e.g., remembering your user name if you register or login), remembering some of your customized user preferences, to help us better understand how people use our Web site, to collect anonymous traffic data, and to help us improve our Web site. In some cases, this information will help us tailor content to your interests or help us avoid asking for the same information when you revisit our Web site. The cookies set by our Web sites are used only by our Web sites. With respect to collecting anonymous traffic data, we may use third parties to collect such data on our behalf. To disable or limit the use of cookies, please refer to the options provided by your Internet browser. If you do so, however, some pages on this Web site may not work properly.

**Web Beacons**. A Web Beacon is a clear GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) image or pixel tag (also known as a "Web beacon") that companies place on their Web sites to allow an Internet advertising or audience measurement company to help them analyze their advertising campaigns and general usage patterns of visitors to their Web sites. Bristol-Myers Squibb uses Web beacons on some of its Web sites. Subject to the transfer of control situation described below, Bristol-Myers Squibb will not sell or rent your personally identifiable information.

**Web Server Logging and IP Addresses**. With or without cookies, our Web site keeps track of usage data, such as the source address that a page request is coming from (i.e., your IP address, domain name), date and time of the page request, the referring Web site (if any), and other parameters in the URL (e.g., search criteria). We use this data to better understand Web site usage on the whole and to determine which areas of our Web site users prefer (e.g., based on the number of visits to those areas). This information is stored in log files and is used by Bristol-Myers Squibb for statistical reporting

**Transfer of Control**. Circumstances may arise where we decide to reorganize or divest part or all of our business or of a line of our business, including our information databases and Web sites, through a sale, divestiture, merger, acquisition, or other means of transfer. In any such circumstance, personally identifiable information may be shared with, sold, transferred, rented, licensed or otherwise provided or made available by us or on our behalf to actual or potential parties to, and in connection with, the contemplated transaction (without your consent or any further notice to you). In such circumstances, we will seek written assurances that personally identifiable information submitted through this Web site will be protected appropriately.

**Regulatory Requirements**. If you contact us regarding your experience with using any of our products, we may use the information you provide in submitting reports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and as otherwise required of us by law or governmental audit. We may also use the information to contact your healthcare professional to follow up regarding an unexpected event involving the use of any one of our products. You understand that in order to comply with the law, Bristol-Myers Squibb may not be permitted to comply with your request to amend or remove personally identifiable information that was provided to Bristol-Myers Squibb by a healthcare professional or a consumer regarding an adverse event or reaction involving medicine, medical products or medical devices.

**Law Enforcement**. In rare situations, we may be required by court order or other legal or regulatory process, or as otherwise required by law to divulge personally identifiable information to law enforcement authorities, the courts, or regulatory authorities. Bristol-Myers Squibb will cooperate in responding to such requests, in accordance with the regulatory or legal process, and will take appropriate measures to ensure that the requester understands the sensitive nature of any health-related personally identifiable information they receive.

**Privacy Policies Governing Linked Web Sites**. As a convenience to our visitors, the Web site contains links to other Web sites that may offer useful information. The Internet Privacy Statement described here does not apply to your use of those other Web sites. Before using the linked Web sites, please review their Internet privacy statements to understand how they use and protect personally identifiable information.

**Changes in Our Privacy Statement**. Bristol-Myers Squibb may at any time revise this privacy statement by updating this posting. You are bound by any such revisions and should therefore periodically visit this page to review the most current privacy statement.

**Online Privacy for Children**. We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. We do not intend to collect personally identifiable information from children under 18 years old. If a child has provided us with personally identifiable information, the parent or guardian of that child may contact us at (877) 274-0626.
