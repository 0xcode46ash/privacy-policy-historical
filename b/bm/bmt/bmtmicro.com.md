# BMT Micro Privacy Statement

**Forward:**

BMT Micro, Inc. has created this privacy statement in order to demonstrate our firm commitment to maintaining your privacy and confidential information. The following discloses our information gathering and dissemination practices.

**Reselling of information:**

BMT Micro, Inc. does not sell or rent your personal information in any capacity to any third party for any reason. There is only one way your information can be obtained from us and that is if we are compelled by a legal authority with the ability to access our records to do so. In 8.5 years it has never happened, but we have to cover ourselves with this contingency. Having said that, remember, we resell software, and developers of said software are supplied with your name, address, and e-mail address (NEVER YOUR PAYMENT INFO!) so that they may contact you about future updates.

**Security:**

This site has security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under our control, including secure socket layer (SSL) certificates provided by [thawte](http://www.thawte.com/) for online credit card payment and password-protected access to our databases. We also offer convenient [toll free ordering](http://www.bmtmicro.com/BMTInfo_OrderingOptions.html) (including toll free fax) as well as toll numbers for non-US callers if you simply do not want to put your information on the web.

As we sell almost 2000 products, we have over 1000 links to other sites for you to learn more about the products we sell. Understandably, we cannot be responsible for the privacy policies for sites that are not under our control. This is an area overlooked by most consumers and often is swept under the rug.

BMT Micro, Inc. will occasionally use online surveys to ask visitors and or customers for feedback on our products and services. These are always 100% optional and are never required. We may use contact data from such surveys to send the user information about our company or to contact users when necessary. Users may opt-out of receiving future direct communications easily and without any hassle by following the choice/opt-out section below.

**Choice/Opt-Out:**

Our site provides users the opportunity to opt-out of receiving future communications.
