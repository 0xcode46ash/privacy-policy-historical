2\. Identifying Purpose  
When you become a BMO Financial Group customer, or apply for additional products and services, we ask you for your personal information for the following purposes:

  * to verify your identity and protect against fraud 
  * to understand your financial service requirements 
  * to determine suitability of products and services for you 
  * to determine your eligibility for certain of our products and services, or those of others, and offer them to you 
  * to set up and manage products and services you have requested, and 
  * to comply with federal and provincial legal or regulatory requirements



Your personal information may be verified with credit bureau, credit insurers, registries, your employer, personal references and other lenders.

3\. Obtain Consent  
When you apply for a new product or service, we ask you for your consent to collect, use or disclose your personal information. You may, at any time, withdraw your consent as long as:

  * you provide reasonable notice 
  * we are not legally required to collect, use or disclose your information 
  * withdrawing your consent does not impede our ability to fulfill your contract with us 
  * it does not relate to a credit product we have granted you where we are required to collect and exchange your personal information on an ongoing basis with credit bureaux, credit insurers and other lenders

4\. Limit Collection  
We only collect the information we need. We may ask you to provide the following information: 

  * **Social Insurance Number (SIN)** for tax reporting purposes as well as other income related government purposes such as when opening an income generating account or a registered retirement investment. We do this in order to comply with the Canada Revenue Agency’s income reporting requirements. We may also collect and use your SIN for administration purposes, such as to ensure an accurate match between your personal information and your credit bureau information, or as an internal identification number to accurately identify customers having same or similar names.


  * **Financial Information** to ensure that the advice we give is appropriate for you and/or the investments you purchase are suitable for your circumstances.


  * **Health Information** is required for some of our insurance products to ensure that you are eligible for coverage.



You can choose not to provide us with certain information in some situations. However, if you make this choice, we may not be able to provide you with the product, service, or information you request. We may monitor or record our telephone calls with you for our mutual protection (e.g. to ensure that your instructions are carried out, to document that we have made required disclosures to you, and to ensure that customer service levels are maintained).

We will make certain that you are informed of the purposes listed above when you apply for any of our products or services. If a new purpose for using your personal information develops, we will ask you for your consent.

5\. Limit Use, Disclosure and Retention  
BMO Financial Group will only use or disclose your personal information for the reason(s) it was collected. Under no circumstances do we sell or give lists of our clients to other companies for their own use, and if we obtain client lists from other organizations, we require the organizations to confirm their compliance with all relevant privacy legislation.

To ensure that you benefit from our full range of products and services, we will, with your consent, share your personal information (other than health information) to the extent permitted by law, amongst BMO Financial Group.

Over time, we may buy new businesses or sell some of our businesses. Accordingly, personal information associated with any accounts, products or services of the business being purchased or sold will be transferred as a business asset to the new business owner.

We may use other companies to provide services to you on our behalf and they will be given only the information needed to perform those services. We have contracts in place holding these companies to the same high standards of confidentiality by which we are governed.

Your information may be transferred across country borders for the purposes of data processing. We may be required to provide information to a government agency under a lawful order made in that country.

Personal information may be released to legal authorities in cases of suspected money laundering or other criminal activity, for the detection and prevention of fraud, or when required to satisfy the legal or regulatory requirements of federal or provincial governments and/or other regulatory authorities. Other reasons for the release of personal information include when we are legally required to do so (e.g. by court order) or to protect our assets (e.g. collection of overdue accounts). If we release information for any of these reasons, we keep a record of what, when, why and to whom such information was released.

BMO Financial Group has policies in place that govern the retention of your personal information so it will be kept only for as long as it fulfills its intended purpose or as legally required.

6\. Be Accurate  
We are committed to maintaining the accuracy of your personal information and ensuring that it is complete and up-to-date. If you discover inaccuracies in our data, or your personal information changes, please notify the branch or office where you do business immediately, so that we can make the necessary changes. As well, we will make our best efforts to advise others of any important amendments to your personal information that we may have released to them. If we do not agree to make the amendments that you request, you may challenge our decision. Recourse is described in the Provide Recourse principle.

7\. Use Appropriate Safeguards  
Your personal information is secure within BMO Financial Group, regardless of the format in which it is held. We have comprehensive security controls to protect against unauthorized use, access, alteration, duplication, destruction, disclosure, loss or theft of your personal information.

We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your personal information. Examples of safeguards include restricted access to our information processing and storage areas, limited access to relevant information by authorized employees only, use of passwords, PINs and pass keys, firewalls and encryption of electronically transmitted information, and the use of secure locks on filing cabinets and doors.

We have agreements and controls in place with credit bureaux, credit insurers, other lenders and third party service providers requiring that any information provided by us must be safeguarded and used only for the sole purpose of providing the service we have requested the company to perform.

Within BMO Financial Group web sites, cookies or other information-tracking technologies may be used to improve the functionality or security of web sites, or to provide you with a more customized online experience. Please note that cookies cannot capture files or data stored on your computer.

8\. Be Open

9\. Give Individuals Access  
If you want to review or verify your personal information, or find out to whom we have disclosed it, please request this by contacting the branch or office where you do business. We may need specific information from you to enable us to search for, and provide you with, the personal information we hold about you. We may charge you a nominal fee depending on the nature of your request. However, we will advise you of the fee prior to proceeding with your request. There may be instances where we are unable to provide some of the personal information we hold about you and if we are unable, we will let you know the reason(s) why.

In most provinces you have the right to access and verify the personal information held about you by credit bureaux. We will provide you with the name and location of any credit bureau that has provided us with a report on you.
