**Privacy & Security**

This policy was last updated on January 25, 2010.

Your privacy is important to us. By participating in the Council of Better Business Bureau's BBBOnLine Privacy Program we have made a commitment to meet the programs' strict requirements regarding how we treat your information and have it verified by BBBOnLine. Further information about this program is available at <http://www.bbbonline.org/privacy>.

Below is the B&H privacy and security policy:

**Security:**

The security of your personal information is very important to us. In an effort to protect your personal information, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology with 128 bit encryption. If your browser supports SSL (most current browsers do), it will automatically encrypt the information you provide to us on the secure pages on our site, before sending it over the Internet.

B&H has obtained a digital certificate from Cybertrust, a leading provider of Internet trust services. B&H's website is also tested and certified daily by ScanAlert to receive its Hacker Safe Certification which ensures that the website passes the FBI/SANS Internet Security Test.

When visiting a page on our site that includes any of your personal information, the bottom of your browser window will display, an icon of a closed lock or an unbroken key (depending upon your browser). This indicates that you have successfully connected with our secure server.

To authenticate the security of your connection before submitting any of your personal information, you can double click on the icon to display our digital certificate.

Some browser versions and some firewalls do not permit communication through secure servers. In that case, we suggest that you visit the B&H super store, or contact us by phone, or fax your order to us.

**Cookies:**

When you visit our site, we will ask your browser to place a permanent "cookie" (a very small text file) on your computer. If your browser is configured to accept cookies, it will accept the cookie and place it on your computer's hard drive. We collect this information to analyze where our customers are coming from and how often they visit our site. We also collect certain technical information from your computer, like your IP address and the address of a referring web site, if any. This information will allow us to enhance our site to our customer's preferences. This information is used **only** for the benefit of B&H and you, our customer.

You can visit our site without cookies if you choose to do so. However, please be aware that some features of the site may not function properly or may be slower if you refuse cookies. To visit our site without cookies, you can configure your browser to reject all cookies or to notify you when a cookie is set. Check the browsers help menu to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

**Registration:**

In order to identify who you are, we suggest that you register and log-in when you visit our site. This allows us to provide you with your "Order Status" and other information that is uniquely yours.

**How to access and/or correct Your Information:**

You can access all the personally identifiable information that we collect online and maintain by phoning 800-606-6969 or 212-444-6615, mail ( 420 Ninth Avenue, New York, NY 10001, USA), or via [e-mail](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=helpcenter&A=getpage&Q=contactForm.jsp&destination=status%40bhphotovideo.com). We use this procedure to safeguard your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity before granting access or making corrections. You can correct factual errors in your personally identifiable information by sending us a request that credibly shows the error.

**What information is collected:**

We offer a number of services that do not require you to register for an account or to provide personal information to us. However, in order to provide our full range of services, we may collect personal information from you. For example, when you sign up for an account with us or for any other service or promotion that requires registration, we may ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address, and an account password).

**What information is covered by our Privacy Policy:**

All personal data transmitted to B&H over the internet pursuant to logging in or registering an account, such as email address, or physical address, or your name in connection with such information shall be treated by us as confidential information covered by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

**What information is not covered by this Privacy Policy:**

Any communication which you submit to us including, without limitation, email, product reviews, or other postings relating to products, experiences, suggestions, or other subject matter will be treated as non-confidential, and non-proprietary transmissions. All submissions made to public areas of our web site, such as product reviews or blog postings are not subject to our Privacy Policy. The terms governing the intellectual property rights to such transmissions are as fully set forth in Section VII of our User Agreement and Disclaimer which can be accessed at <http://bhinsights.com/content/user-agreement-and-disclaimer.html>.

**Links:**

Our site contains links to manufacturers, and other related sites for your benefit. B&H is not responsible for the privacy practices, security, or content of such web sites. If you click on one of these links, you will be redirected to their web site and, in doing so, you may provide information directly to them. Therefore, you should refer to their privacy policies to understand how they handle your information and what choices you have.

**Relationships/Sharing Information:**

B&H maintains special relationships with a number of secure business partners.

B&H may share account or other information when we are required by law or to protect our interests or property. This may include sharing information with other companies, lawyers, credit bureaus, agents or government agencies in connection with issues related to fraud, credit or debt collection.

You agree that B&H may use personal information provided by you in order to conduct appropriate anti-fraud checks. Personal information that you provide may be disclosed to a credit reference or fraud prevention agency, which may keep a record of that information.

B&H also shares information with outside companies that perform services for B&H. For example, when a customer signs up for our e-mail newsletters, B&H will provide the customers e-mail address to third party e-mail distribution companies that transmit e-mails on behalf of B&H. Your e-mail address will not be used by these companies for any purpose other than for the transmission of e-mails for B&H.

We may retain outside companies to assist us in managing our customer information database or to update and correct customer information for future marketing purposes. B&H takes steps to ensure the confidentiality of your information and to make sure it is not used for other purposes.

B&H has carefully selected a few companies to assist us in better understanding how our customers use our site. We will place cookies on your computer to collect information. The information that is collected through these cookies tells us things, such as which search engine referred you, how you navigated around our site, which pages you browsed, what you purchased and what traffic is driven by banner ads and e-mails. The companies analyze the information they collect from our site and return it to us through a secure connection. We use this information to help us understand your interests in our site and how to better serve you. It also helps us provide you with more personalized product offerings.
