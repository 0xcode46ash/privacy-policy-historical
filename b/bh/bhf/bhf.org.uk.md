# Our privacy and cookies policy

The British Heart Foundation is committed to protecting your personal information and being transparent about what information we hold, whether you are a donor, volunteer, shopper or campaigner.

Developing a better understanding of our supporters through their personal data allows us to fundraise more efficiently, which ultimately helps in the fight for every heartbeat. We have made improvements to this policy so that transparency is at the core of what we do, especially around our policy on profiling and wealth screening (see 'Fundraising' section below).

The purpose of this policy is to give you a clear explanation about how the BHF and all of its subsidiaries collects and uses the personal information you provide to us and that we collect, whether online, via phone, email, in letters or in any other correspondence or from third parties.

We ensure that we use your information in accordance with all applicable laws concerning the protection of personal information. This policy explains:

If you have any queries about this privacy and cookies policy please contact the Data Protection Officer at the Legal and Corporate Governance Department, British Heart Foundation, 180 Great Hampstead Road, London or email: [dataprotection@bhf.org.uk](mailto:dataprotection@bhf.org.uk).

We are the leading heart charity in the UK and our registered charity numbers are 225971 in England and Wales, and SC039426 in Scotland. We are also registered as a company in England and Wales under registration number 00699547.

British Heart Foundation Ventures Limited a registered company in England and Wales: number 02767880, British Heart Foundation Sales Limited, registered company in England and Wales: number 00877530 and London to Brighton Bike Ride Limited, registered company in England and Wales: number 02672643 are wholly owned subsidiaries of BHF which trade on its behalf. Within the context of this policy ‘we’ means both the charity and its subsidiaries. Each of these organisations are data controllers under the data protection rules.

#### Information collection

We collect information in the following ways:

  * **Information you give us.** For example, when you engage with our social media or message boards, make a donation to us, register for an event or otherwise provide us with personal information. When you register, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address and telephone number to store with your account.
  * **Information we get from your use of our website and services.** We collect information about the services you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit our websites or view and interact with our ads and content.
  * **Information from third parties.** We may also receive information about you from third parties. This can include information such as your name, postal address, email address, phone number, your geographic location (for mobile devices), credit/debit card details and whether you are a tax payer so that we can claim Gift Aid.  We, like all companies, are able to confirm what browser you are using, IP address and computer operating systems that are being used and this information may be used to improve the services we offer



Wherever possible we use aggregated or anonymous information which does not identify individual visitors to our websites. See below, under  **Marketing materials**  – to understand our purposes for processing your personal information.

Data Protection law recognises that certain categories of personal information are more sensitive. This is known as sensitive personal data and covers health information, race, religious beliefs and political opinions. We do not usually collect ‘sensitive personal data’ about our supporters unless there is a clear reason for doing so, such as participation in a marathon or similar fundraising event or where we need this information to ensure that we provide appropriate facilities or support to enable you to participate in an event. 

We may also collect sensitive personal data if you make the information public or if you tell us about your experiences relating to heart disease (for example, if you call our helpline, act as a case study for us or volunteer to be a ‘Heart Voice’); however we will always make it clear to you when we collect this information from you, what sensitive personal data we are collecting and why.   


#### Website users

All BHF websites use cookies to help our websites work well and to track information about how people are using them. More information on cookies can be found further down the page under 'Cookies'.

In addition, if you register on our websites then the following will also apply:

  * All BHF websites collect personal information when you register with us.
  * The website you sign up to will collect information such as your name, email address and post code. Once you register with that website you will not be anonymous to us when you subsequently sign in.
  * As part of the registration process and continued use of BHF services, you agree that any registration information you give to BHF will always be accurate, correct and up to date. Please do get in touch should you need to amend any of your personal information. 
  * We collect and retain information about your interactions with us so that we can process your interactions and deal with future queries.
  * We use cookies to allow us to store limited information on an individual’s computer to either track them through tracking cookies or to allow people to have automatic logons as an example. We use this information to provide you with a good experience when browsing our website and to improve the functionality of our site.



#### Your debit and credit card information

If you use your credit or debit card to donate to us, buy something or pay for a registration online or over the phone, we will ensure that this is done securely and in accordance with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. You can find our more information about PCI DSS here - [https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/index.php)

We do not store your credit or debit card details at all, following the completion of your transaction. All card details and validation codes are securely destroyed once the payment or donation has been processed. Only staff authorised and trained to process payments will be able to see your card details. 

If we receive an email containing any credit or debit card details, it will be immediately deleted, no payment will be taken and you will be notified about this. All purchases or donations should be completed through the donation page or online shop on our website ([www.bhf.org.uk](http://www.bhf.org.uk/)) or via our customer support centre by calling 0300 330 3322.

#### Legal basis & Legitimate Interests

When we collect and use your personal information, we will make sure this is only done accordance with at least one of the legal grounds available to us under Data Protection law. 

One of these is where we have obtained your specific consent to use your information for a previously notified purpose, such as to send you email/text marketing or to provide you with a product, service or information at your request.

Another is where we have a legal obligation to use or disclose information about you – for instance, where we are ordered by a court or regulatory authority or we are legally required to hold donor transaction details for Gift Aid or accounting/tax purposes.

In certain instances, we may collect and use personal information where this is necessary in our legitimate interest as a charity, this includes being able to:

  * send direct marketing material to supporters by post or contacting them by telephone for fundraising purposes (subject to checking against the Telephone Preference Service and any existing marketing preferences). See more at **Marketing Materials** below;
  * conduct research to better understand who our supporters are and better target our fundraising activity. See more at **Fundraising** below; 
  * monitor who we deal with to protect our charity against fraud, money laundering and other risks;
  * maintain and administer our donor database and systems.



In all cases, we balance our legitimate interests against your rights as an individual and make sure we only use personal information in a way or for a purpose that you would reasonably expect in accordance with this Policy and that does not intrude on your privacy or previously expressed marketing preferences. 

Where we process sensitive personal data (as mentioned above), we will make sure that we only do so in accordance with one of the additional lawful grounds for processing such as where we have your explicit consent or you have made that information manifestly public. When we do this, we will tell you what sensitive personal data we are collecting and why.

Such information is compiled using publicly available data about you or information that you have already provided to us. 

This activity assists us in understanding the background of the people who support us and helps us to make appropriate requests to supporters who may have the means and the want to give more.
