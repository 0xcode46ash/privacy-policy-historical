# Privacy Policy | www.beuc.eu

This privacy policy has been updated on 28 jan 2015

## Privacy Policy

BEUC strongly believes that you have the right to control the use of your personal information and that your privacy must be respected. We strictly limit the processing of your personal information to the specific purposes described in our privacy policy. We have chosen to use the services of only those companies that respect your fundamental rights to privacy and protection of your personal data.

We have developed this privacy policy to explain what information we collect about you when you get in contact with us or use our website.

## Cookies

BEUC uses cookies on its website [www.beuc.eu](http://www.beuc.eu/). Cookies are text files containing a small amount of data which is sent to your computer when you visit our website. Cookies involve the collection and storage of personal information.

We only install those cookies which are strictly necessary for the correct functioning of our website.

We also use the services of third parties to analyse the use of our website and to monitor when, where and how people access information so that we can adapt the site to better suit our users' needs. For this service we use PIWIK because it fully respects your privacy. For example, it anonymises your IP by removing its last octet, so we will never know your full IP address.

### Cookies we use

  1. Session cookie: This cookie remembers the information you have been searching for on our website. It is deleted as soon as you close your browser.
  2. Cookie banner: This cookie is used to remember your choice when you land on our website for the first time and you decide whether or not to accept our cookies.
  3. Analytics cookie: We use PIWIK to monitor and analyse traffic on our website. PIWIK will collect usage statistics such as the number of page visits, documents downloaded etc. and provides us with aggregate numbers. Any IP addresses collected have the last octet removed and we will therefore never know your exact IP. This cookie is very important for us to evaluate the correct functioning of our website and is therefore always installed by default. Further information on how PIWIK respects your privacy can be found here.
  4. Dailymotion cookie: We use the video sharing platform Dailymotion which requires the installation of their cookie to embed videos into our website. To find out more about the privacy policy of Dailymotion please click here.
  5. Social media: Normally, social media buttons install cookies on your website. We do not use any third party social media plugins and therefore no cookies are installed. However, our website offers the possibility to share content with the most common social media platforms. Only when you decide to share a piece of content with a platform, our website will link you to that platform. Be advised that when you use such social sharing media you are bound by the terms and conditions as well as the privacy policies of each social media platform.



## Job Vacancies

When there is a vacancy at BEUC, candidates apply via a recruitment form on our website. The recruitment form collects personal data such as your name, last name, email address, or CV. This information is never stored on our webserver and is directly emailed to our Human Resources Department.

## Updates & contact

### Changes to our Policy

It might happen that we have to change our Privacy Policy, for instance to comply with new legal requirements. However, if we make any changes to our policy, we will make this information publicly available on our website; the date and nature of the change will also be clearly indicated in our privacy policy.

### How to contact us

If you have any questions, complaints or queries with regards to how we use your information, we encourage you to contact us and we will do our best to resolve it. You can send your questions, complaints or queries to [communications@beuc.eu](mailto:communications@beuc.eu) or [consumers@beuc.eu](mailto:consumers@beuc.eu).
