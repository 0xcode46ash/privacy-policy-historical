**Our Information Collection Practices:**

  * Bentley makes use of conventional on-line data entry forms to collect personal information from web visitors.  We request no more information than is required to fulfill the purpose for which the information is being collected.

  * We support two Bentley-hosted applications that collect data for e-commerce purposes. We also maintain partnerships with selected vendors to process e-commerce transactions on our behalf.  These e-commerce transactions are secured with SSL and maintain high standards of privacy, to which approved sub-contracting vendors are also held. 

  * Bentley's web site neither targets persons who are less than 13 years of age nor knowingly collects personal information online from them.

  * We use cookies to verify default variables and to enable single-sign on for other Bentley applications.

**How We Use Your Information:**

  * We use the information you submit to provide you with the product or service you requested, consistent with the purpose for which the information was collected. 

  * We may on occasion disclose statistical information to third parties in an aggregate, anonymous form. 

  * At present, Bentley does not make alternate uses of information collected through e-commerce transactions. But in the future, we may elect to send you information about the institution, its programs and events. 

  * We do not share, trade, or sell personal information to third parties without your consent except 



    * In limited ways as required by law, and 

    * With sub-contractors engaged by us to provide services, and 

    * For purposes of fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

**Important Technical Information:**

Bentley follows industry-standard precautions and procedures in the transmission and storage of electronic data. When you make online payments, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) server software in conjunction with your SSL-enabled-browser software prevents unauthorized access to the information you submit by encrypting it during transmission. While we remain committed to protecting the privacy of our users, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once we receive your transmission, we make our best effort to ensure its security on our systems. We do so by using secure technology, privacy protection controls, and restrictions on employee access.

  * Although every reasonable effort is made to present current and accurate information and to monitor web content for compliance with institutional policy, Bentley makes no guarantees of any kind, nor does it take institutional responsibility for undetected, noncompliant conditions created without its knowledge or consent and in violation of its policy. 
  * Information on [www.bentley.edu](http://www.bentley.edu/) is subject to change without prior notice.
