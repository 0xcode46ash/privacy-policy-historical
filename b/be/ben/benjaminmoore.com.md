Privacy Statement 

**Our Commitment To Privacy**

Welcome to Benjamin Moore & Co.’s Internet website! Your privacy is very important to us. At Benjamin Moore & Co., we value your privacy and have made it our policy to provide on-line content that requires minimal collection of information. Furthermore, to better protect your privacy we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used. 

**How We Collect Information**

Below are some of the ways in which you may provide information to us and how we may use that information. 

**Domain Name Recognition**

Our web servers automatically recognize your domain name; however, they do not recognize your e-mail. 

**Use Of Cookies**

Cookies are elements of data that a website transfers to an individual's computer for record keeping purposes. We use cookies in a variety of ways to provide you with better service. For example, cookies may be used to improve your experience with our tools, or to ensure that a promotion is not entered more than the permitted number of times. We use a cookie in the My Project Notebook area when you build a profile. This cookie is the key to your Notebook and is stored within your browser. The purpose for this cookie is to allow the system to recognize you as a return visitor and populate your Notebook with the color schemes you have added. Personally identifiable information which may be obtained through cookies is not sold, rented or provided to third parties and is not used internally by Benjamin Moore & Co. for any purpose other than to enhance your experience on our website. 

**Information Actively Provided by Our Visitors**

We do not require you to register or provide any information before entering our website. However, there are several places where you may choose to provide personally identifiable information. Unless we tell you otherwise, Benjamin Moore will use the information for the purpose the information was provided. 

For example: 

  * **Sweepstakes:** We may offer sweepstakes on our website. We collect only the information necessary for prize fulfillment from those who win. If a prize is valued at over $600, a social security number may be requested. The first initial, last name, city and state of all winners will be included on a Winners List. The Winners List will be provided upon request and as required by law. Information required for tax purposes, the Winner’s List or other information required by law is kept as required by law. 
  * **E-mail Newsletters:** Some of our pages permit visitors to register to receive e-mail newsletters or updates in the future by providing your e-mail address. Any e-mail you receive from Benjamin Moore will allow you to change your preference or "unsubscribe" from this informational service at any time. 
  * **Job Applications:** We will use the information submitted in on-line job applications for the sole purpose of filling the specific position applied for by the applicant. After this position is filled, we will retain the information submitted for the period of time required by applicable law. During this retention period, the application will be considered inactive, and the applicant will be considered for other positions only if he/she submits an additional application for those specific positions. We will not release information submitted in on-line job applications to third parties except to appropriate governmental authorities as required by law. 
  * **Other Features:** There may be other features available on our website which may require some personally identifiable information to use the feature. We only use the personally identifiable information to provide the feature and delete it within a reasonable period of time after the information is no longer necessary. 



**Business Partners**

We have some business partners with whom we may operate some of our pages and share information. For example, on occasion we may offer a sweepstakes jointly with another company. In such instances, information may be shared with the co-sponsor so that the sweepstakes may be conducted. 

**Aggregate Information**

Aggregate information about which pages visitors access or visit (for example, to enter a visitor in a sweepstakes or to send the visitor information) is only used for internal review as we work to improve our website. This information is not sold to or shared with other organizations for commercial purposes. We do not rent, sell, or share e-mail addresses with any other company or organization. 

Finally, we never use or share the personally identifiable information provided to us on-line in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt-out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses. 

**Our Commitment To Data Security**

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place and will continue to improve appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect on-line. 

**How You Can Access Or Correct Your Information**

You may review your personally identifiable information, have it deleted and withdraw permission for its continued use by Benjamin Moore for our e-mail newsletters by accessing your preference page in the e-mails that you receive. 

**This Privacy Policy Is For Our On-line Consumers**

This Privacy Policy is for our consumers who visit our internet site. It does not apply to information which we may collect by means other than over the Internet and it does not apply to businesses which may use our site. 

**Links**

Our policy is to link only to other sites which are appropriate for visitors to our website. However, because content on websites can change quickly, we cannot always guarantee the appropriateness of the content of sites we link to. 

**How To Contact Us**

If you have other questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact us at: [info@benjaminmoore.com ](mailto:%20info@benjaminmoore.com).
