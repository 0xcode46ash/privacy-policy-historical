## Privacy Policy

Last Updated: August 17, 2011

It’s like they always say, some things are better kept private. Here at Benefit Cosmetics (“Benefit”, “us”, “our” or “we”), we’re all about R.E.S.P.E.C.T. We value your concerns about privacy and want to make sure you feel comfortable using our websites and applications. Here’s the nitty-gritty on our Privacy Policy so you know what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.

Please note that this Privacy Policy governs information provided to Benefit and communications from Benefit, including information you provide to us on Benefit’s website at www.benefitcosmetics.com (“Benefit’s Website”), on Benefit’s blog at blog.benefitcosmetics.com (“Benefit’s Blog”), on Benefit’s mobile and Facebook applications (including Ratings & Reviews and Ask & Answer) (“Benefit’s Applications”), in sweepstakes or other promotions, in completing customer surveys, and information you provide to us at a Benefit boutique (brick and mortar stores). It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference Benefit with our affiliates, such as Sephora or Macys. Your use of Benefit’s Website, Benefit’s Blog, or Benefit’s Applications (collectively, “Benefit’s Sites”), your entry in our sweepstakes and other promotions and your submission of customer surveys constitute your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.

##### Non-Personal Identifiable Information

When you visit Benefit’s Website, Benefit’s Blog, or use Benefit’s Applications, with the help of our third party authorized agents, we may collect certain anonymous information about your visit. For example, when you browse Benefit’s Website or Benefit’s Blog we may monitor statistics including but not limited to the number of people that visit these websites, peak hours of visits, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com) and which browsers people use to visit these websites (e.g., Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Internet Explorer), geographical information, etc. In addition, we may also collect information about your browsing behavior, such as the date and time you accessed the website, the areas or pages of the website that you visit, the amount of time you spend viewing the website, the number of times you return to the website and other click-stream data.

We, or service providers acting on our behalf, may use cookies or web beacons to collect the non-personal information described above. Although it sounds like an afternoon snack, a cookie is actually a piece of data stored on your computer’s hard drive that enables us to track and target your shopping experience and order as you shop on our site. A web beacon is typically a one-pixel image, used to pass information from your computer to a website. We may also use cookies or web beacons to 1) remember you when you return to the website; 2) provide you with customized content and advertising; 3) keep track of what you have saved in your Shopping Bag; and 4) monitor the effectiveness of our advertising and emails. If you reject our cookies, you may still use Benefit’s Sites, but you may be limited in some of the features. Cookies and web beacons do not contain personally identifiable information.

Benefit uses non-personal identifiable information for internal business and marketing purposes and to help administer and improve Benefit’s Sites for your shopping and user experience. We may use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes to analyze trends and site traffic patterns to improve our content, merchandise, and services.

We also work with service providers that use cookies and web beacons to collect information about your visits to Benefit’s Website and to other websites you may visit, and to serve advertisements to you across the Internet based on that information. If you would like to learn more about this practice, and know your choices with respect to it, please visit [here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

##### Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information is any information about you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, credit card number and billing information, birth date, email, profile information, and purchase history. Whether or not you provide your personally identifiable information to us is completely up to you, but if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use some of our services.

Below are some examples of when we may collect personally identifiable information from you.

**Purchases.** When you place an order through Benefit’s Website, we require that you provide your name, email, shipping/billing address, phone number, credit card number and its expiration date in order to process and track your order. We may also maintain a record of your product purchases.

**Creating an Account.** When you create an account on Benefit’s Website, we ask for your full name and email address. We also ask you to create a password to access your account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password. You do not need an account to make an online purchase, but you will need to create an account to use some of the other features on Benefit’s Website, such as to participate in the Ratings & Review feature. You can also create an account on Benefit’s Blog by providing a username and your email address. 

**Sign-up for Emails and Catalogs.** You can sign up on Benefit’s Sites and in Benefit stores to receive promotional emails from us that include the latest information about our new products, exclusive offers, tips and tricks and more. If you sign up for emails, we will ask you for your email address, name and country location. If you sign up to receive our catalog, we will ask for your name, mailing address, email and other optional information regarding your preferences and interests.

**Facebook Applications.** When you use one of our applications on Facebook, we will request your permission to access certain personally identifiable information on Facebook, such as your name, profile picture, gender, networks, user ID, list of friends, and other profile information. Depending on the application, you may have the opportunity to post reviews, questions, answers and other content to the application. You can change certain settings relating to these applications through your account and privacy settings on Facebook.

**Sweepstakes, Contests and Promotions.** If you enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, we may ask you for your name, date of birth, email, country/state of residence and other demographic information. We may sometimes use a third party application on Facebook or other third party websites to host a sweepstakes, contests and promotions. In those instances, the information you provide will be submitted to that third party and their privacy policy will govern the use and disclosure of the information you submit.

**Feedback.** If you contact us to give us feedback or ask questions about Benefit’s Sites or any of Benefit’s services or products, we may store your communications, including any personally identifiable information you include in them, so we can effectively respond to you.

We collect this information to serve you better and to provide you with a customized experience while using Benefit’s Sites. We may use your personally identifiable information to: fulfill a request from you, such as to send you catalogs, promotional emails or email notifications, fulfill and deliver your orders, tell you about our new products, services and offers, respond to your comments, feedback or questions, contact you if necessary while processing an order, and generate web analytics to compile user data for marketing purposes. If you would rather not receive promotional emails from us, please see the section titled “Opting Out” below.

We may also combine the personally identifiable information you provide us with other personal information about you (such as demographic and past purchase information) from our records and from other sources, such as address update services. We may use this combined information for future marketing initiatives and to help us improve Benefit’s Website presentation, Benefit’s Blog, Benefit’s Applications, and your overall shopping experience. We may share aggregate data about our customers with third parties, including advertisers and marketing partners. This information does not identify individual customers.

On occasion we may also share a portion of our postal mailing list (which includes our customers’ names and postal addresses) with other companies or organizations who want to market products or services to you. We may also share your name, postal address and transactional information (including information about your past purchases but not any payment information) with third parties for marketing purposes, unless you direct us not to (see “Opting Out” section below). We do not ever rent or sell your email address with these organizations or with other third parties for marketing purposes.

Benefit may also share your personally identifiable information with third parties that perform services for us, such as our affiliates, advertisers, partners, potential business partners, vendors, and other unaffiliated entities. These companies and individuals are hired to perform functions on our behalf, such as fulfilling and processing orders, processing credit card payments, performing data and marketing analysis, and providing customer support. While such third parties may be provided with access to personally identifiable information needed to perform their function, they may not use or disclose such data for any other purpose. Additionally, our service providers are contractually required to maintain all the information collected for us in strict confidence.

For fraud protection and compliance with law, we may disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, that we deem necessary.

In the event another company buys the assets or ownership interests in Benefit, your personally identifiable information may then belong to that other company.

##### Information Contained In User Comments

Any information you submit in a user comment to be posted on one of Benefit’s Sites (such as comments on Benefit’s Blog, reviews or comments on the Ratings & Reviews feature, questions or answers on the Ask & Answer application), including any personally identifiable information, will not be treated as confidential and may be publicly disclosed.

##### Location Services

Benefit’s Applications may include features that can provide you with location-based information if you tell us where you are (i.e., by allowing your mobile device to send us your location). If you want to deactivate this feature, please contact your carrier for information on how you can disable location services on your mobile device.

##### Protecting Kids’ Privacy

Benefit’s Sites are not intended for children. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children, and none of the Benefit Sites are designed to attract children. Children under 13 may look at Benefit’s Sites, but are not permitted to make a purchase, create an account, enter a sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, submit a customer survey, sign-up for emails or post comments on Benefit’s Blog or on Benefit’s Applications. If we discover someone under the age of 13 has created an account or has otherwise provided us with their personal information, no matter how adorable they might be, we will remove their personally identifiable registration information from our records. If you are under 13 and would like to make a purchase, please ask a parent to place the order for you.

##### Protecting Your Security

Security for Benefit’s Sites is in accordance with industry standards to protect the security of your personal information both online and offline. Personally identifiable information is stored on computer servers in a controlled environment that is reasonably protected from unauthorized misuse or disclosure. We use available technology and other techniques to implement systems like firewalls, and/or encryption to secure marketing data transfers.

Orders placed on Benefit’s Website are encrypted using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology, an industry standard that is used by vendors to ensure the security of online business. It negotiates and employs the essential functions of mutual authentication, data encryption, and data integrity for secure transactions.

We take special steps to safeguard your personal information and since your password is protected, only you can access your account information. We recommend that you keep your password private and always sign-off of your account and close your browser when you are finished shopping. If you have any questions about security on our website, please email [privacy@benefitcosmetics.com](mailto:privacy@benefitcosmetics.com).

We are not responsible for notices that are not labeled or sent improperly, or do not have complete information. We will process your request within 30 days of the date we receive your request, but you may, in the meantime, receive previously scheduled emails, mail or calls from us. Once you have opted out, you do not need to do so again.

Please note that Benefit may still use your personal information (and may share your information with our service providers) to provide you with services, including sending you administrative and transaction-related emails, relating to your online shopping needs and your other activity on Benefit’s Sites.
