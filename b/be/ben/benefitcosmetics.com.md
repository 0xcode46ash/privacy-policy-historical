  We use a third-party marketing company to assist us in providing marketing messages and analyzing the success of our marketing campaigns online and off-line. On our behalf, DoubleClick may note some of the pages you visit on our site through the use of one-by-one pixel tags (also called clear gifs or web beacons or counting tags). A counting tag is a line of code embedded on certain pages of our site to tell us that we have a unique visitor on that page, and also which ad was successful in bringing visitors to our site. These tags do not collect or contain or transmit personally identifiable information. The counting and visit information collected by DoubleClick on our behalf is used only by us and not used by DoubleClick for other purposes. In the course of your visit to this site, DoubleClick may place or recognize a unique "cookie" on your computer's browser.
