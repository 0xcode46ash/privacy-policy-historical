# privacy policy

It’s like they always say, some things are better kept private. Here at Benefit Cosmetics we’re all about R.E.S.P.E.C.T. We value your concerns about privacy and want to make sure you feel comfortable using our website. Here’s the nitty-gritty on our Privacy Policy so you know what information we collect about you during your visit and what we do with that information.

Please note that this Privacy Policy governs information provided to Benefit Cosmetics and communications from Benefit Cosmetics, including information you provide to us on Benefit Cosmetic’s website at ww.benefitcosmetics.com (“Benefit’s Website”), on the Benefit Cosmetic’s blog at blog.benefitcosmetics.com (“Benefit’s Blog”), on the Benefit Cosmetics Ratings & Reviews application on Facebook, and information you provide to us if you sign up at a Benefit Cosmetics boutique (brick and mortar stores). It does not govern any other information or communications that may reference Benefit Cosmetics with our affiliates, such as Sephora or Macys. Your use of Benefit’s Website,Benefit’s Blog, or Benefit’s Ratings & Reviews applicaton on Facebook constitutes your acceptance of this Privacy Policy and your consent to the practices it describes.

Non-Personal Identifiable Information

When you visit Benefit’s Website, Benefit’s Blog, or Benefit’s Ratings & Reviews application on Facebook, with the help of our third party authorized agents, we collect certain anonymous information about your visit. For example, when you browse Benefit’s Website or Benefit’s Blog we may monitor statistics such as the number of people that visit our site, peak hours of visits, which page(s) are visited on our site, from which domain our visitors come (e.g., aol.com, hotmail.com, etc.), and which browsers people use to visit our site (e.g., Netscape Navigator, Microsoft Internet Explorer, etc.), broad geographical information, site-navigation pattern, etc.

We may obtain this non-personal information by placing a “cookie” on your computer’s hard drive so we can recognize you as a new or return user and personalize your experience. Although it sounds like an afternoon snack, a cookie is actually a piece of data stored on your computer’s hard drive that enables us to track and target your shopping experience and order as you shop on our site. For example, cookies are used to save your Shopping Bag information so you can browse from page to page without losing that information. If you reject our cookies, you may still use Benefit’s Website, but you may be limited in some of the features. Cookies do not contain personally identifiable information.

Benefit Cosmetics uses non-personal identifiable information for internal business and marketing purposes and to help administer and improve Benefit’s Website for your shopping experience. We may use the information you provide in aggregate form for internal business purposes to analyze trends and site traffic patterns.

Personally Identifiable Information

Personally identifiable information is any information about you as an individual, such as your name, address, telephone number, credit card number, birth date, or email.

We collect personally identifiable information from you when you communicate with us via email, Benefit’s Website, Benefit’s Blog, Benefit’s Ratings & Reviews application on Facebook, telephone, in writing, or at a Benefit Cosmetics store, when you place an order or fill out a registration form or request a catalog from us, when you post a user comment on our Blog or Ratings & Reviews application, and when you participate in a contest, sweepstakes, survey or other promotion. When you place an order through Benefit’s Website, we require that you provide your name, email, shipping/billing address, phone number, credit card number and its expiration date in order to process and track your order. We may also maintain a record of your product purchases. Whether or not you provide your personally identifiable information to us is completely up to you, but if you choose not to provide the information we request, you may be unable to use some of our services.

We may also combine the personally identifiable information you provide us with other personal information about you (such as demographic and past purchase information) from our records and from other sources.
