**Cookies and Pixel Tags**   
We regularly use browser tracking cookies.  A cookie is a small data file that websites often store on your computer's hard drive when you visit their sites. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you and can only be read by a website or web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.     
We use cookies but do not store personally identifiable information in your cookie. We use cookies in order to improve your shopping experience. For example, we use cookies to:

Through our use of cookies, we may also track and maintain the identity of the website you visited immediately prior to visiting our website. We do not otherwise track any information about your use of other websites.

Cookies are also used to review how visitors to our website navigate our site or interact with our email advertising.  Third-party companies assist in the collection and analysis of this data.  Your name, street address or credit card number is not accessed by or shared with other companies.

**Security**   
We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect your online order information as it is transmitted over the Internet.   To make sure you are accessing our server in a secure manner, before you submit personal financial information, look at the lower right-hand corner of your browser window after accessing the server. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending on your browser), then SSL is active. You can also double-check by looking at the "Address" line of your browser. When accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https." 

If for any reason you are unable to connect to the server, or if you are not quite comfortable shopping online at any of our websites, please feel free to place your order with us by calling Customer Care at  1-800-811-5868. 

Identity thieves sometimes send fraudulent email messages to trick customers into divulging personal or financial information (a practice known as "phishing").  If you receive an email that looks like it is from us asking for your personal information, do not respond.  We never request your password, user name, credit card information or other personal information through email.  If you have received or entered personal information in response to a suspicious email, pop-up or phony website claiming to be affiliated with Ben Sherman or its affiliates, please email us at customercare@bensherman.com.
