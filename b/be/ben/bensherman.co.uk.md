If you do not want us to use your data in this way, or to pass your details on to third parties for marketing purposes, please tick the relevant box situated on the form on which we collect your data).

### Non-Personal Information and the Use of “Cookie” Technology

We may collect non-personal information through the use of either "cookie" technology, IP address tracking or both. Non-personal information is information that does not identify you personally and might include the browser you use, the type of computer, the operating systems, the Internet service providers and other similar information. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your hard drive, not on this site. Cookies allow us to personalise your experience at this site by automatically gathering information about the areas you visit on this site and about the links you may select from within this site to other areas of the World Wide Web or elsewhere online. Cookies also allow you to store your password (in the event one is necessary), without having to constantly re-enter it.

We use such information in the aggregate to understand how our users as a group use the services and resources provided on this site. In this way we know which areas of this site are favourites of our users, which areas need improvement, and what technologies are being used so that we may continually improve this site.

We may also share this aggregate statistical information with our partners, suppliers and other third parties. Most web browsers are set to accept cookies. You can set your browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, please note that some parts of this site may not work properly.

### Links to Other Sites and Liability to Third Parties

Users may find advertising or other content on this site that provide links to the sites and services of our partners, sponsors, licensors and other third parties. We do not control the content or links that appear on these sites and we are not responsible for the information or links you may find there. These sites and services may have their own privacy policies, or no policy at all. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party site or service before providing them with your personal information. The presence of these links on this website is not intended to imply our endorsement of that site or its goods or services, but to provide a convenient link to relevant sites managed by other organisations, companies or individuals.

Although we will use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal identification information, transmissions made by means of the Internet cannot be made absolutely secure. The Company will have no liability for disclosure of information due to errors in transmission or unauthorised acts of third parties.

### Security Policy

We will make reasonable efforts to keep secure the data you provide us and will take reasonable precautions in an effort to protect your personal identification information from loss, misuse or alteration.

### Choice/Opt-Out

If at any time you would like to stop receiving information from us, you can let us know by:

  * writing to: Marketing Department, Ben Sherman Group Limited, 2 Eyre Street Hill, Clerkenwell, London EC1R 5ET or
  * sending an e-mail stating your preference to: [marketing@bensherman.co.uk](mailto:marketing@bensherman.co.uk)



We will then use reasonable efforts to remove your personal identification information from our current files, unless we are entitled to retain it pursuant to an agreement that you have entered into with the Company or your information has been archived by us.

### Transfer of Business Assets

As we continue to develop our business, we may be acquired, merge with another business, acquire or buy other businesses or assets. In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets. In such an event, both personal identification and non-personal information will be one of the transferred assets, and by using this site you agree to the transfer of your personal information in such circumstances.

### Interactive Services

We may from time to time provide interactive services on this site, including, without limitation:

  * Chat rooms.
  * Bulletin boards.



### Interactive services

Where we do provide any interactive service, we will provide clear information to you about the kind of service offered, if it is moderated and what form of moderation is used (including whether it is human or technical).

We will do our best to assess any possible risks for users (and in particular, for children) from third parties when they use any interactive service provided on this site, and we will decide in each case whether it is appropriate to use moderation of the relevant service (including what kind of moderation to use) in the light of those risks. However, we are under no obligation to oversee, monitor or moderate any interactive service we provide on this site, and we expressly exclude our liability for any loss or damage arising from the use of any interactive service by a user in contravention of our content standards, whether the service is moderated or not.

The use of any of our interactive services by a minor is subject to the consent of their parent or guardian. We advise parents who permit their children to use an interactive service that it is important that they communicate with their children about their safety online, as moderation is not foolproof. Minors who are using any interactive service should be made aware of the potential risks to them.

Where we do moderate an interactive service, we will normally provide you with a means of contacting the moderator, should a concern or difficulty arise.
