# Privacy Policy | Benevity

### PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: September 8, 2008

Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of your personal information is a fundamental principle in our relationship with our users, Integration Partners and corporate sponsors. This Privacy Policy tells you how we will ensure the confidentiality and privacy of the information with which you entrust us. All terms used in this policy as defined terms and not specifically defined herein, have the respective meanings provided in our Terms of Use.

This policy governs the use of personal information respecting the public portions of the Benevity website at [www.benevity.org](http://www.benevity.org/). To learn about terms and conditions applicable to your use of the Benevity Donation Platform from the secure portions of the Benevity site or from the site of one of our Integration Partners, please read the User Agreement found on the applicable site.

Access and use of this Website is provided by Benevity to you on condition that you accept the terms of the Privacy Policy, and by accessing or using this Website, you agree to these terms. If you do not agree with and accept this Privacy Policy, you should not access or use this Website.

Benevity may revise and update this Privacy Policy at any time and without notice. You are cautioned to review the Privacy Policy posted on the Website periodically. Your continued access or use of this Website after any such changes are posted will constitute your acceptance of these changes.

By using the Benevity site, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information in accordance with this policy. The terms of this policy apply to all personal information collected by Benevity on the website benevity.org and other Benevity websites which are linked to Benevity.org. We have created this policy pursuant to the Personal Property Protection Act (Alberta) 2003, c.P-6.5. Your home jurisdiction may have privacy laws that are more or less protective than the province of Alberta, Canada.

This site is operated by Benevity Social Ventures, Inc. ("Benevity") and may be accessed in Canada and abroad. For personal information protection purposes, Benevity is the controller and, unless otherwise noted, is also the processor of the personal information. Information collected may be retained as long as it is reasonably required for the purposes it was collected.

### Privacy Officer

We have designated an officer of Benevity to be accountable for our policies and practices with respect to the management of personal information. You may forward any questions, comments or complaints that you might have about this privacy policy to Bryan de Lottinville, President and CEO to our company address, or by email to: [privacy@benevity.org](mailto:privacy@benevity.org).

### Consent to Collection of Your Personal Information

When you visit this site, certain kinds of non-personal information, such as the website that referred you to us, your IP address, browser type and language, and access times, may be collected automatically as part of the site's operation. We also may collect navigational information, including information about the pages you view, the links you click, and other actions taken in connection with the site. We only collect personal information about you after you have provided us with your consent to collect that specific information. By voluntarily providing this information to us, you consent to the collection and use of your personal information as set out in this privacy policy. You may always choose not to provide personal information, but if you so choose, certain products and services may not be available to you.

\- provide customer service;  
\- perform research and analysis aimed at improving our products, services and technologies;  
\- to display content that is customized to your interests and preferences;

We may send transaction-related communications such as welcome letters, reminders, and donation confirmations.

We may disclose your personal information to the Benevity Group, provided that the Benevity Group uses your personal information for the same purposes and protects it to the same degree, as set out in this Privacy Policy. Personal information disclosed to the Benevity Group may be available to the United States government or its agencies under a lawful order made in a court of competent jurisdiction in the US.

### Use of Cookies and Other Technologies

Benevity uses "cookies" to enable you to sign in to our services and to help personalize your online experience. A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your hard drive. Cookies contain information, including personal information, that can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. The information that cookies collect includes the date and time of your visit, your registration information, session identification number and your navigational history and preferences.

Cookies offer you many conveniences. They allow us to identify registered users when they return to the site so that they can retrieve previous information and interact with the site more efficiently.

In some cases, our third-party service providers or Integration Partners or corporate sponsors may use cookies on our site. We have no access to or control over these cookies. This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by Benevity only, and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.

You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies.

If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to sign in or use other interactive features of our site and services that depend on cookies but you will be able to perform basic navigation through the site.

In addition to cookies, we may use other technologies, including single-pixel gifs (also known as web beacons) on our websites and in e-mail messages or newsletters.

### Security of Your Personal Information

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to help protect your personal information including without limitation:

* limiting access to your personal information to those of our employees who require it to provide services to you;  
* requiring employees to sign confidentiality agreements to protect customer and other confidential information;  
* ensuring that third-party service providers, Integration Partners and corporate sponsors sign confidentiality agreements to maintain the confidentiality of your personal information and not to use it for any unauthorized purposes;  
* encrypting credit card information on our donation forms using secure socket layer (SSL) technology; and  
* storing your personal information in secure computer systems which protect it from unauthorized access or use.

No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If a password is used to protect your account and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.

Our site may include interactive areas or services, including blogs, chat rooms, bulletin boards, message boards, discussion forums, online hosting or storage services, or other areas or services in which you or third parties create, post or store any content, messages, comments, materials or other items on the sites ("Interactive Areas"). If you use an Interactive Area, you should be aware that these areas are open to the public and any personal information you post or provide at registration may be viewable by others. We are not responsible for personal information you submit in connection with the Interactive Areas, nor are we responsible for how others might use that information, including to send you unsolicited messages. Interactive Area postings may be retained indefinitely. If at any time you would like to remove a posting, please email us at [help@benevity.org](mailto:help@benevity.org). Keep in mind that removal of a posting from an Interactive Area does not mean that the posting will be deleted from our systems.
