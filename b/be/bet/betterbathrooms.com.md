  * **Marketing & Market Research**



At BetterBathrooms, we collect data to give you a better experience, improve our products and services, and bring you the very best offers and competitions that we think you’ll be interested in.

    * We use your data to improve your experience. We will send you relevant offers, competitions, and news about our products and services in a number of ways including by email, but only if you have previously agreed to receive these marketing communications.

    * We also like to hear your views to help us to improve our services, so we may contact you to invite you to take part in market research via a questionnaire. You always have the choice about whether to take part in this or not.


  * **Understanding our customers better**



We may make use of profiling your personal data to produce more relevant and tailored communications by having a deeper understanding of your interests, behaviours and personal preferences. This information helps us provide a better experience for our customers. 

Profiling can help us target our resources more effectively through gaining an insight into the background of our customers and helping us to build relationships that are appropriate to their interests.

If you have any specific questions in relation to how your information is processed, then please contact us

### Processing your data using our Legitimate Interests

We have a number of lawful reasons that we can use (or 'process') your personal data. One of these lawful reasons is called 'legitimate interests'.

Broadly speaking legitimate interests means that we can process your personal information if:

  * We have a genuine and legitimate reason to and we are not harming any of your rights and interests.



The following are some examples of when and why we would use this approach during our normal course of business:

  * **To improve and enhance our services:** When we do process your data, we will use it to benefit you and to make your experience better and to improve our products and services.
  * **Your best interest:** Processing your information to protect you against fraud when transacting on our website, and to ensure our websites and systems are secure.
  * **Personalisation:** Where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our services/communications for the benefit of our customers.
  * **Analytics:** To process your personal data for the purposes of customer analysis, assessment, profiling and direct marketing, on a personalised or aggregated basis, to help us with our services and to provide you with the most relevant information as long as this does not harm any of your rights and interests.
  * **Research:** To determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising and to develop our products, services, systems and relationships with you.
  * **Due Diligence:** We may need to conduct investigations on existing customers, potential customers and business partners to determine if those companies and individuals have been involved or convicted of offences such as fraud, bribery and corruption.
  * **Direct Marketing:** We may send postal marketing. We will also make sure our postal marketing is relevant for you and tailored to your interests. You also have the right to opt-out of receiving this information at any time.



When we process your personal information for our legitimate interests, we will consider and balance any potential impact on you and your rights under data protection and any other relevant law. Our legitimate business interests do not automatically override your interests – we will not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law).

### How we look after your data:

We will protect the data that you entrust to us via appropriate security measures and controls. We’ll also ensure that other businesses we work with are just as careful with your data.

  * We will always take appropriate technical and organisational precautions to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
  * We ensure your data is encrypted and secure.
  * We will continually test, audit and monitor our compliance with Information Security standards and relevant Data Protection regulations.
  * We ensure those 3rd parties who process your data operate under a Data Sharing Agreement.



_Your data outside Europe_

The data that we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored at, a destination outside the European Economic Area (EEA). It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for us or for one of our suppliers.

Such staff maybe engaged in, among other things, the fulfilment of your order, the processing of your payment details and the provision of support services. 

We have ensured that appropriate protections are in place to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected and is treated in line with relevant Data Protection laws. Details of who we share data with outside the EEA will be published in this section before 25th May 2018.

### How long we hold your data:

We hold your information only as long as necessary for each purpose we use it, we will provide detailed information about our retention in this section before 25th May 2018 to give you an understanding of how long we hold your information for.

### What can I do?

  * **Right to be informed**  
We will always be transparent in the way we use your personal data. You will be fully informed about the processing through relevant privacy notices.
  * **Right to access**  
You have a right to request access to the personal data that we hold about you and this should be provided to you, under the Data Protection Act 1998, within 40 days. We are able to charge a small fee of £10. If you would like to request a copy of your personal data, please contact us via the Contact us section.
  * **Right to rectification**  
We want to make sure that the personal data we hold about you is accurate and up to date. If any of your details are incorrect, please let us know and we will amend them.
  * **Right to erasure**  
You have the right to have your data ‘erased’ in the following situations: 
    * Where your personal data is no longer necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was originally collected or processed.
    * When you withdraw consent.
    * When you object to the processing and there is no overriding legitimate interest for continuing the processing.
    * When your personal data was unlawfully processed.
    * When your personal data has to be erased in order to comply with a legal obligation.



If you would like to request erasure of your personal data, please contact us via the contact us section. Please note that each request will be reviewed on a case by case basis and where we have a lawful reason to retain the data, it may not be erased.

  * **Right to restrict processing**



You have the right to restrict processing in certain situations such as:

    * Where you contest the accuracy of your personal data, we will restrict the processing until you have verified the accuracy of your personal data.
    * Where you have objected to processing and we are considering whether BetterBathrooms legitimate grounds override your legitimate grounds.
    * When processing is unlawful and you oppose erasure and request restriction instead.
    * Where we no longer need the personal data but you require the data to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.


  * **Right to data portability**



You have the right to data portability in certain situations. You have the right to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes via a machine-readable format, such as a .CSV file. This only applies:

    * To personal data that you have provided to us;
    * Where the processing is based on your consent or for the performance of a contract; and
    * When processing is carried out by automated means.


  * **Right to object**



You have the right to object to the processing of your data in the following circumstances:

    * Direct marketing (including profiling). Remember you can opt out at any time from marketing communications;
    * Where the processing is based on legitimate interests; and
    * Processing for purposes of scientific/historical research and statistics.
