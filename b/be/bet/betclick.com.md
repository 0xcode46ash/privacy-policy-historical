**5\. Cookies**

A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Cookies help us to provide you with a better Site. We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. For the session ID cookie, once users close the browser, the cookie simply terminates. A persistent cookie is a small text file stored on the user's hard drive for an extended period of time. Some of our business partners use cookies on our Sites (for example, advertisers). However, we have no access to or control over these cookies once we have given permission for our partners to set cookies for advertising. We use cookies with your permission to remember information about your Site preferences (for example, the language you use on the Site). You may decline to accept cookies but this will prevent you from taking full advantage of the Site and your user experience of the Site will be reduced.

**6\. Security**

BetClic Limited is a company incorporated in Malta with company number C40330 and has its registered address at Portomaso Tower, 6th Floor, St. Julian’s, STJ 4011, Malta. Betclic is regulated by the Lotteries and Gaming Authority in Malta. BetClic Limited uses its best endeavours to protect the confidentiality of your personal data and to prevent any unauthorised external or internal users from accessing such information without your consent. However, Betclic shall take no responsibility whatsoever for events beyond its control inclusive of, but not limited to, acts of god or natural disasters and including power cuts and strikes.

We are sure that, as our customer, you understand the evolving nature of our business due to continuous technological innovation and, although we endeavour to do our best to ensure the protection and privacy of your personal data at all times, we cannot guarantee that the performance of our service will be free from error at all times. Should any such error have an effect or consequence on the privacy of your personal data, we shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever in damages or otherwise.

We strongly recommend that you do not divulge your personal data to strangers or third parties during live chat. Remember that your personal data is sensitive and it’s important to stop and think before passing on personal information. 

_Profile_

We store information that we collect through cookies and log files to create a profile of our users. A profile is stored information that we keep on individual users that detail their viewing preferences. Consequently, the information we collect is tied to the user's personally identifiable information to provide relevant offers and to improve the content of the Site for the user. Your profile is used to tailor your visit to our Site and to direct marketing promotions to you which we feel you would be interested in . We do not share your profile with other third parties outside of companies within our Group. 

_Log Files_

Like most standard website servers we use log files. This includes IP addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the Site, track user's movement in the aggregate and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use.

 _Data Encryption_

All sensitive data which is transmitted between your computer and Betclic is transferred securely via the internet, using strong encryption. Betclic uses secure and tested encryption technology bearing certificates provided by renowned certificate authorities.

 _Other security measures_

When users submit sensitive information via the Site, their information is protected both online and offline. When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number), that information is encrypted and is protected using Secure Socket Layer– (SSL) technology. While on a secure page, such as our deposit page, the lock icon at the bottom, or in the url, of your web browser becomes locked. The lock icon is unlocked, or open, when users are simply 'surfing' and are not inputting sensitive information. All payments made on our Site are secured, in compliance with the relevant EU rules and regulations.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user information offline. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only authorised BetClic employees/contractors are granted access to personally identifiable information. We perform checks on all of our potential employees/contractors to ensure that none of them have a criminal record. Our employees/contractors are regularly made aware of security best practices within the industry and security audits are carried out on a regular basis. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment.

**7\. Modifications**

It may become necessary, at any time, for us to make modifications to the Site or to the House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy governing its services. The purpose of such modifications may be to further simplify user processes or to further reinforce security measures in order to upgrade to future technological innovations. In such cases, customers previously registered on our Site will keep their user name and password; no modifications will be required on their part. Continued use of our Site by the members after any modifications to the Site, House Rules, Terms and Conditions or Privacy Policy will be considered as their acceptance thereof. It is the responsibility of each customer to regularly check the House Rules, Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy for updates.
