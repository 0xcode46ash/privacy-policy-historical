### Legal Definition

### What this means in English

1\. WHO WE ARE

Put simply, Advantix Technologies Ltd ("Better Proposals", "us" or "we") provides a simple proposal creation tool. Our registered company number is 08961263, and our registered address is Palladium House, 1-4 Argyll Street, London, W1F 7LD

Some basic details about who we are. 

2\. WHO AND WHAT THIS POLICY APPLIES TO

2.1 Our Privacy Policy deals with how we handle “personal information” as it is defined in the Privacy Act (Personal Information).

2.2 We handle Personal Information for our own business, as well as potentially storing Personal Information in our systems on behalf of our customers and users that input Personal Information into our systems.

2.3 Our Privacy Policy does not apply to information we collect about businesses or companies, however it does apply to information about the people in those businesses or companies which we store.

2.4 The Privacy Policy applies to all forms of information, physical and digital, whether collected or stored electronically or in hardcopy.

2.5 If, at any time, an individual provides Personal Information or other information about someone other than himself or herself, the individual warrants that they have that person's consent to provide such information for the purpose specified.

2.6 Our website and services are unavailable to children (persons under the age of 18 years). If an individual is under 18 years of age, they can only use our website and services under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

These are some definitions of terms and phrases that will be used throughout this agreement. 

3\. THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT

3.1 In the course of business it is necessary for us to collect Personal Information. This information allows us to identify who an individual is for the purposes of our business, share Personal Information when asked of us, contact the individual in the ordinary course of business and transact with the individual. Without limitation, the type of information we may collect is: Personal Information. We may collect personal details such as an individual’s name, location, date of birth, nationality, family details and other information defined as “Personal Information” in the Privacy Act that allows us to identify who the individual is; Contact Information. We may collect information such as an individual’s email address, telephone & fax number, third-party usernames, residential, business and postal address and other information that allows us to contact the individual; Financial Information. We may collect financial information related to an individual such as any bank or credit card details used to transact with us and other information that allows us to transact with the individual and/or provide them with our services; Statistical Information. We may collect information about an individual’s online and offline preferences, habits, movements, trends, decisions, associations, memberships, finances, purchases and other information for statistical purposes; and Information an individual sends us. We may collect any personal correspondence that an individual sends us, or that is sent to us by others about the individual’s activities.

3.2 We may collect other Personal Information about an individual, which we will maintain in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

3.3 We may also collect non-Personal Information about an individual such as information regarding their computer, network and browser. This may include their IP address. Where non-Personal Information is collected the UK Privacy Principles do not apply. 

1\. If your free trial ends and you haven't subscribed to a paid option, we may delete your data. 

2\. Better Proposals is provided "as-is" at the time of registration. 

3\. We offer email support to all users, and phone support to certain paid accounts. 

4\. HOW INFORMATION IS COLLECTED

4.1 Most information will be collected in association with an individual’s use of Better Proposals, an enquiry about Better Proposals, or generally dealing with us. However we may also receive Personal Information from sources such as advertising, an individual’s own promotions, public records, mailing lists, contractors, staff, recruitment agencies and our business partners. In particular, information is likely to be collected as follows: Registrations/Subscriptions. When an individual registers or subscribes for a service, list, account, connection or other process whereby they enter Personal Information details in order to receive or access something, including a transaction; Accounts/Memberships. When an individual submits their details to open an account and/or become a member with us; Supply. When an individual supplies us with goods or services; Contact. When an individual contacts us in any way; Access. When an individual accesses us physically we may require them to provide us with details for us to permit them such access. When an individual accesses us through the internet we may collect information using cookies (if relevant – an individual can adjust their browser’s setting to accept or reject cookies) or analytical services; and/or Pixel Tags. Pixel tags enable us to send email messages in a format customers can read and they tell us whether mail has been opened.

4.2 As there are many circumstances in which we may collect information both electronically and physically, we will endeavour to ensure that an individual is always aware of when their Personal Information is being collected.

4.3 Where we obtain Personal Information without an individual’s knowledge (such as by accidental acquisition from a client) we will either delete/destroy the information, or inform the individual that we hold such information, in accordance with the UK Privacy Principles. 

1\. You always own any data you store in Better Proposals. We will only access it in order to solve a technical problem submitted by you. You must comply with all data laws relevant to the type of data you are storing. 

2\. If you don't secure your password properly, we are not responsible for any data loss. 

3\. You are responsible for the content in any communications sent out via the system and must comply with all relevant laws. 

4\. If you break any of these rules, or are found to be breaking the law, we will suspend your account until the issue is resolved. 

5\. WHEN PERSONAL INFORMATION IS USED & DISCLOSED

The purpose of collection is determined by the circumstances in which the information was collected and/or submitted.

5.2 We will retain Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.

5.7 We will not disclose an individual’s Personal Information to any entity outside of Australia that is in a jurisdiction that does not have a similar regime to the UK Privacy Principles or an implemented and enforceable privacy policy similar to this Privacy Policy. We will take reasonable steps to ensure that any disclosure to an entity outside of Australia will not be made until that entity has agreed in writing with us to safeguard Personal Information as we do.

5.8 We may utilise third-pay service providers (such as Gmail from Google, Inc., and MailChimp from The Rocket Science Group LLC) to communicate with an individual and to store contact details about an individual. These service providers are located in the United States of America. 

1\. If you choose to use the system with any 3rd party integrated service, we will not provide support for that service outside the scope of the integration. 

2\. If you choose to use an integration which shares your data with a 3rd party service, we will not be responsible for any breach of data as a result. 

6\. OPTING “IN” OR “OUT”

6.1 An individual may opt to not have us collect their Personal Information. This may prevent us from offering them some or all of our services and may terminate their access to some or all of the services they access with or through us. They will be aware of this when: Opt In. Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to have information collected and/or receive information from us; or Opt Out. Where relevant, the individual will have the right to choose to exclude himself or herself from some or all collection of information and/or receiving information from us.

We cannot accept responsibility for misuse or loss of, or unauthorised access to, Personal Information where the security of information is not within our control.

7.4 We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of any third party (including third parties that we are permitted to disclose an individual’s Personal Information to in accordance with this policy or any applicable laws). The collection and use of an individual’s information by such third parties may be subject to separate privacy and security policies.
