Phone: 888-428-9482

### Fraud Protection

We are committed to protecting your account from unauthorized activity. We will work to recover any loss that results from unauthorized use of your Betterment account.1 If you see any unauthorized activity in your account, report it immediately. Do not share your account information or password with anyone else. If we determine the transaction was initiated by someone you have given your account information and password to then we will have to consider the transaction authorized by you.

For more information on phishing and fraud, please review our [Security Procedures](https://www.betterment.com/about/privacypolicy/security-procedures/).

1 Applies only to transactions covered under the federal Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and requires that you notify us within 60 days of the unauthorized transaction and that you have exercised appropriate account safeguarding practices and have complied with your responsibilities as set forth in the Betterment account agreement and disclosures.

### Privacy Protection

Because we value your trust, we will protect the privacy of your information and will never sell your personal information to a third party without your permission for any purpose.

For more information on how we value your privacy, please review our [Privacy Policy](https://www.betterment.com/about/privacypolicy/).

### Security Protection

We use banking industry standards for data security to ensure your information is safe and our interactions with you are secure. We use 256-bit SSL encryption, store all of our data on our own servers in a secure facility, and implement systematic processes and procedures for securing and storing data.

For more information on our security technology and procedures, please review our [Security Procedures](https://www.betterment.com/about/privacypolicy/security-procedures/).

### Account Protection

Betterment accounts are SIPC protected (up to $500,000 per customer) against losses resulting from fraud or mismanagement. SIPC coverage means that if anything happens to Betterment you will get your securities back promptly. Unlike FDIC insurance for banks, SIPC does not protect against losses due to normal swings in the market. An explanatory brochure is available at [http://www.sipc.org](http://www.sipc.org/).  
Betterment LLC (“Betterment”) and Betterment Securities (collectively the “Firms”) each comply with Regulation S-P which requires financial institutions to adopt policies and procedures to protect the non-public personal information of clients. The Firms do not sell personal information to other companies for their independent marketing purposes.

### General Policies

The Firms collect and maintain personal information in order to provide investment management services. The Firms collect and maintain information provided by our clients or that we are authorized by our clients to obtain, as well as information generated by us or received from our respective affiliates as well as third parties in servicing client accounts. Subject to exceptions described in this Privacy Policy, the Firms do not disclose personal information to outside parties in any personally identifiable form. However, the Firms may include personal information in certain data analysis, reports, or other interpretations of investment trends. Such uses and the results thereof may be published, or otherwise made available to other clients of the Firms or the public at large, provided however, that personal information will never be individually identifiable to any particular client absent that client’s affirmative consent to further disclosure.

### Criteria for Disclosure

In order to service a customer account, Betterment or Betterment Securities may disclose necessary personal information to companies including, but not limited to, brokerage firms, custodians and public accounting firms (as permitted or required by law). Betterment and Betterment Securities will not otherwise disclose any personal customer information unless:

  * Betterment or Betterment Securities receives prior written consent from the client;
  * Betterment or Betterment Securities believes the recipient is an authorized representative of the client; or
  * Betterment or Betterment Securities is required by law to disclose information to the recipient.



### Procedure

To fulfill the Firms’ commitments to privacy, each has instituted firm-wide practices to safeguard the information they maintain. The Firms each employ physical and electronic safeguards to keep client information safe, limit access to personal information to only those employees with authorized access, and require third parties that perform services for the firms to agree to keep client information confidential. Furthermore, if a client relationship is terminated, the Firms will continue to adhere to the privacy policies and practices described above.
