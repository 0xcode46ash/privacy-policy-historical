**Credit Card Usage Policy**

  


  

  1. All credit card transactions are charged in US dollars.
  

  2. All players using a credit card to deposit at BETSHARKS.com agree to complete any reasonable verification requirements to prove that they are the authorized cardholder.  
As a verification procedure, some BETSHARKS.com credit card deposits may actually be charged to your card as a random amount below the actual value of your deposit. We may then ask you to provide us with this random amount (in $US) to verify the amount of the transaction, proving that you have access to the credit card statement and are most likely the authorized card owner. For example if a player submits a $100 deposit, we may actually charge the credit card $99.86, but deposit $100 to the player's BETSHARKS.com account. We will then ask the player exactly how much was charged to the card, and if they look at their statement they should be able to tell us the correct answer of $99.86.
  

  3. Some credit card deposits may not be charged to your card immediately. As a fraud protection measure, in certain circumstances we will only pre-authorize a charge to your card and then the settle the transaction when we are satisfied that it is a legitimate charge. Many banks also have processing delays, especially if a charge is submitted on a weekend. It is not unusual to see delays of up to 5-10 days between when you submit a transaction to your BETSHARKS.com account and the charge actually appears on your credit card statement.
  

  4. Players are emailed a transaction receipt for every credit card deposit made at BETSHARKS.com. Please keep a copy of these transaction receipts for your records.
  

  5. Details of your BETSHARKS.com credit card transactions are displayed in the history tab of the cashier within the BETSHARKS.com software, and are also displayed on the player ledger page of the player admin.
  

  6. BETSHARKS.com uses various billing companies and merchant accounts to process credit card transactions. These merchants do not take nor accept any responsibility if the cardholder is not satisfied with the services offered by BETSHARKS.com.

Where possible will cancel the transaction or refund directly to the credit card used to make the account deposit, but in some cases we may not be able to do this due to credit card processing regulations.

Some verification from the cardholder may be required in the event that we are not able to refund directly to a card.

  9. Remember that credit card fraud is not a game. If you dispute valid transactions at BETSHARKS.com we will track you down, prosecute you and recover all debts in full along with related fines and fees.
