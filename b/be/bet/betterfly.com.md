## INFORMATION COLLECTED AND NOT COLLECTED.

_Personal Information_. Betterfly provides various information ("Informational Services") on the Site, which can be accessed by individuals who register to use the Services ("Registration"). During Registration, Betterfly requires individuals to provide contact information, such as email address ("Personal Information"). You may also be asked to provide additional information to confirm your identity for password establishment, re-setting, and for other purposes. To become a teacher/instructor in the Betterfly marketplace, we also require you to provide additional information about your background.

_Cookies_. Betterfly also may collect information through the use of common information-gathering tools such as web beacons or cookies ("Cookie Information"). A cookie is a small string of text that a website can send to your browser which helps the Site remember and customize your visit. You have the option to delete or decline cookies by changing your browser's settings. No personally identifiable information is stored in these cookies. Betterfly advertises its Site through Google AdWords. As such, the Site uses the DoubleClick advertising cookie. You may choose to opt out of the DoubleClick cookie at any time by using [DoubleClick's opt-out cookie](http://www.google.com/intl/en/privacy/ads/).

_Web Beacons and Server Logging_. We may also use single pixel images on the Site or in our emails to you (web beacons). This technology tells us more about browsing, click-tracking, viewing, and buying activity, but none of your Personal Information will be transmitted. Betterfly may also collect information from your interaction with the Site, such as statistics in connection with pageviews, IP address, and standard web log information.

_GPS Information._ When browsing the Site through a mobile phone or mobile application, we will attempt to collect your location through GPS. You may remove this location sharing authorization.

_Children Under 13_. Betterfly does not knowingly collect any Personal Information from or about a child under the age of 13 without the consent of the child's parent or legal guardian. If we discover that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under 13 years of age, we will promptly take all reasonable measures to delete that data from our systems.

_Financial Information_. Betterfly also provides products and services for purchase on the Site ("Products and Services"). When purchasing Products and Services, you are redirected to a Paypal payment landing page where you must complete the transaction by using an existing Paypal account or by providing Personal Information as well as a credit or debit card number and a billing address ("Financial Information"). This payment process is external to Betterfly. Betterfly does not have any access to your Financial Information inputted through the Paypal payment process nor do we collect Financial Information for any purpose. When purchasing Products and Services, information you submit through the payment process with Paypal is outside of the scope of this policy, and we encourage you to review Paypal's privacy policy before making any such purchase.

## NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS.

Your California Privacy Rights Pursuant to the "Shine the Light" Law: California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (Effective January 1, 2005), requires that if a business has an established business relationship with a California resident and has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such resident's personal information to a third party, knowing or having reason to know that such third party used the information for its direct marketing purposes, then the business must disclose such informationsharing to the resident upon request, including what personal information was shared, and with whom it was shared. A business is deemed in compliance with this law if: (1) it has a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer's personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the customer's consent (either opt-in or opt-out); and (2) it provides the customer upon request with a notice of his/her choice to prevent such sharing and a cost-free means to exercise that choice. As a general matter, consent by "opt-in" means that a business will not share a customer's personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer affirmatively consents to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest consent). On the other hand, consent by "optout" means that a business may share a customer's personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer expressly disallows or objects to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest disallowance or objection).

As stated herein, Betterfly does not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless with your consent. California residents may request an information sharing disclosure from us by emailing your request to help [at] betterfly [dot] com. Under the applicable laws, Betterfly is not required to respond to your request more than once in a calendar year or emails not sent to the above email address.

## PROTECTION OF YOUR INFORMATION.

Unfortunately, no data transmitted over or accessible through the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Betterfly attempts to protect all Personal Information, Betterfly cannot ensure or warrant that Personal Information will be completely secure from misappropriation by hackers or from other nefarious or criminal activities, or in the event of a failure of computer hardware, software, or a telecommunications network. Betterfly will notify you in the event we become aware of a security breach involving your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined by the applicable state and federal laws) stored by or for us. By disclosing your email address to us for any reason, you expressly consent to receive electronic notice from us in the event of such a security breach.
