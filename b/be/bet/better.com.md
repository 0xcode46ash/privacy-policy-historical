# Better - Online Training That Works

Better AG ("Better") operates [http://better.com](https://better.com/) (the "Service"). It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please [contact us](http://better.com/en/company/#contact).

**Better cares deeply about your privacy. Not only because we think you'll be mad at us if we don't, but because it's right.** What you do is nobody else's business, unless you want them to know so that they can help you with something. We follow these principles: 

  * We don't ask you for personal information unless we need it to improve the learning experience. 
  * We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights [1]. 
  * We aim to make it as simple as possible to control what information other users and the public can see about you. 



[1] Sadly, the applicable law in most countries doesn't respect privacy anywhere near as much as they ought to. From a privacy point of view, complying with the law is therefore scary. We'll try our utmost to do the right thing, but since governments have guns, we can't make any promises. 

## What information we collect

### Device information

We may collect device-specific information, such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, browser type, browser language, referral URL, or mobile network information. 

### Log information

When you use Better, our server logs may collect certain information about your activities, including details of pages you viewed, the date and time of each request, and IP addresses. 

### Learning data

Our learning products are data-driven. In order to provide the best learning experience, we collect detailed data about your interactions with Better, for example exercises completed, responses provided, activity patterns, etc. 

### Local storage

We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches. 

### Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. We use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our products, and their website access preferences. 

Visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our products, with the drawback that certain features may not function properly without the aid of cookies. 

### Provided by you

Certain visitors to our website choose to interact with our product in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. 

For example, to learn using Better, a user is asked to provide information such as name and email address. Those who engage in transactions with us, for example by purchasing access to particular material or functionality, are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. 

In each case, we collect such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with Better. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. 

## How we use the information

We use the information we collect from our users to maintain, protect and improve our services, and to develop new ones. We use information collected from cookies and other technologies, like pixel tags, to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. 

### Support

When you contact us, we may keep a record of your communication to help solve any issues you might be facing. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish a de-personalised, anonymised version of it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. 

### Location

We may process personal information on our servers in any country in the world, and therefore cannot guarantee that your information will be processed or stored on a server located in the country where you live. 

### News

If you are a registered user of our website and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Better and our products. 

## When we share the information

We do not share potentially personally-identifying or personally-identifying information with outside parties unless one of the following circumstances apply. 

### With your consent

We will share personal information when we have your consent to do so. This will always be done on an opt-in, rather than an opt-out, basis. In other words, we will not assume that we have your consent. 

### With your organisations

As a Better user, you can opt-in to interact with groups representing different types of organisations (typically, your employer) on Better. 

If you do so, others authorized by the organisation (e.g. your managers, HR colleagues, or external service providers) will have access to some of the information we hold about you (including your email and other data). In particular, they may be able to: 

  * view statistics about your account, including what you are learning, how much time you have spent doing so, how much longer we expect you will need to reach your goals, etc. 
  * enroll you in new courses, or change your goals for existing courses 
  * change your account's email address or password
  * suspend or terminate your account access
  * receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request 
  * restrict your ability to delete or edit information



In such cases, please refer to your organisations' privacy policy for more information. 

### With our service providers

We disclose such information only to those of our employees, contractors, and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. 

Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. By using our websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. We will not rent or sell such information to anyone. 

### For legal reasons

We will share personal information with outside parties outside if we: 

  * are required to do so by law
  * believe in good faith that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Better, third parties or the public at large 
  * detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues 



### In a depersonalised, aggregated way

We may share statistics about the behavior of visitors to our websites. For instance, we may monitor the most popular courses. We may display this aggregated information publicly or provide it to others. 

## Accessing and updating your personal information

Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it — unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. 

## Transparency and choice

People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used. 

## Information security

We take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access to, use of, alteration of, or destruction of personal information. 

## Terms of service

Use of the Service is subject to our Terms of Service. This Privacy Policy should be read in conjunction with them. In the event of a conflict or disagreement between this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, the Terms of Service shall prevail. 

## Continuation

If Better is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of any personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy. 

## Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, we may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, and in our sole discretion. 

We will post any privacy policy changes on this page, and encourage you to check it for any changes to our Privacy Policy. If the changes are significant, we will aim to provide a more prominent notice — email notifications, for example. 

Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change. We will also keep prior versions of this Privacy Policy in an archive for your review.
