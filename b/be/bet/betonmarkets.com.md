# BetOnMarkets.com - The World of Financial Trading

The personal information that we obtain about you assists us in servicing your account. We know you may be concerned about what we do with this information, and with financial information about your account. The following outlines our privacy practices. 

**Use of Information**

The Data Protection laws and regulations place obligations on users of personal data and lay down principles for fair and lawful processing of this information. We are committed to safeguarding your privacy online. We only use your personal information to help us service your account, to improve our services to you, and to provide you with products you have requested. We do not sell your personal information to third parties, but we may provide your personal information to payment providers to facilitate transactions on your account. 

Your personal information is used primarily as a way of authenticating you as the proper owner of your account and as the person to whom withdrawal payments may be made. We collect personal data relating to you directly from you when you fill in the account opening form. In the event of any doubt as to the authenticity of your account details or of any withdrawal request, the company reserves the right to request further authentication information as may be deemed appropriate under the circumstances. 

The above personal data that we collect will be held by us and processed for any purpose as may be allowed by law or required by any law. We may also transfer such personal data to any company within the Regent Markets Group of companies or any of our business associates. 

Please note that our website generates log files that record the IP addresses of accesses to your account. This information is gathered with the sole purpose of assisting in the unlikely event of a need to investigate accesses to your account by unauthorized users. Additionally we may verify certain of the information you supply in the account opening form, or otherwise, with third-party information providers. 

Please note that you may update your personal information at any time by logging into the "Settings" section of your account. It is your responsibility to ensure that BetOnMarkets.com is promptly and continually informed of any change in your personal information. 

**Security**

We protect your account information. That's why you have to enter a unique LoginID and Password each time you want to access your account information. In addition, you can use the LogOut button located in the site to securely exit your account without closing your browser. Your Password should never be shared with anyone. Key login forms situated throughout the website are protected by SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption, which guarantees that information submitted from your browser to our server arrives unaltered and intercepted by no third party. Your password is stored on our server in an encrypted format that even BetOnMarkets.com staff may not decrypt. Therefore, in the event that you lose your password, we have no means by which to retrieve it, and therefore you must properly authenticate yourself to us so that we may issue a new password to you. 

Credit card details are submitted directly into the Visa/Mastercard network via SSL encryption in accordance with bank policy.

If you do not accept the cookie, then you will need to input your loginID and password again at every form required to enter into the system. You are advised to choose this option if you have concerns about the security of your personal browser or PC.
