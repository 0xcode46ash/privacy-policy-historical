This data may include: the IP address of the user accessing our site (i.e. the unique I.D. number of the user's computer), the type of browser (Internet Explorer, etc.) and the operating system (system software) the website the user last visited before linking to our site, how long the user accessed our site in any given session, and the date and time of access.
