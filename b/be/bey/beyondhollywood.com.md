# BeyondHollywood.com | Privacy Policy

BeyondHollywood.com (and its sister sites, including asianmovienews.com and TheSciFiBlog.com) takes your privacy very seriously. Below, find our privacy policy, which is updated as of October 8, 2004:

**Advertisers**

**  
** We currently use several outside ad companies to display ads on our site. These ads may contain 

_cookies_

. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by the ad companies to help them gauge the performance of their ads, and we do not have access to this information, nor do we want to. All information collected by advertisers do not specify you as an individual, but rather as one passing surfer out of millions a day.

**Third Party Advertising**

  
We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads . These companies may use information ( _not including_ your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you. 

  
**Third Party Cookies**

**  
** In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser. Please take note that by the time you found our site, you had received third-party cookies from all those other sites you visited as well, so they are 

_not_

unique to us. In fact, this is the norm when browsing the Internet.

**Personal Information**

We do not, nor do we desire to, collect any personal information on our visitors. All information about you, the surfer, are provided by you, the surfer, on a voluntary basis. We run web polls that helps us to gauge the "demographic" of the people who visits us. We will eventually use this anonymous information you provide us to present to potential advertisers. Again, there is 

_nothing_

about these web polls or cookies that will single you out as an individual. You are, for all intents and purposes, a faceless individual in a sea of faceless individuals. No one will ever call you up because you surfed BeyondHollywood.com.

**Email Addresses**

**  
** The only email addresses that are collected by us are those volunteered by our visitors for our message board, which is itself a voluntary part of our site which our visitors may choose to take part in or ignore completely. We will never sell or make any use of your email address, ever.

**External Links**

**  
** BeyondHollywood.com contains links to other sites that we think are interesting and that you may also find interesting. Nixflix.com is 

_not_

responsible for the privacy practices or the content of any sites outside of our own. Please surf our external links at your own choice.

**Contacting Us**

  
If you have any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or your dealings with this site, you can contact the webmaster at [ nix@beyondhollywood.com](mailto:nix@beyondhollywood.com)
