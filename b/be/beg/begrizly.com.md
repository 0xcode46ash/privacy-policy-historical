# Privacy Policy – Grizly

Grizly respects and protects the privacy of the individuals that use Grizly’s services (“Grizly Services”). Individually identifiable information about you is not willfully disclosed to any third party without first receiving your permission or as explained in this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”).

## **Grizly and Cookies**

Upon your first visit to begrizly.com, Grizly sends a “cookie” to your computer. A cookie is a piece of data that identifies you as a unique user. Grizly uses cookies to improve the quality of our service and to understand our user base more. Grizly does this by storing user preferences in cookies and by tracking user trends and patterns of how people use the Grizly Services. Grizly will not disclose its cookies to third parties except as required by a valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Be aware, however, that some parts of the Grizly Services may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

In the course of serving advertisements to this site, our third-party advertiser may place or recognize a unique “cookie” on your browser.

We require that all e-mails promoting [BeGrizly.com](http://begrizly.com/) or its products are sent only to clients who have agreed to receive such messages.

## **What Information Do We Collect?**

Grizly does not collect any unique information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.) except when you specifically and knowingly provide such information. For example, Grizly DOES collect such information from those users registering as Community Users and/or User Editors. Grizly notes and saves information such as time of day, browser type, browser language, and IP address with each query. That information is used to verify our records and to provide more relevant services to users. For example, Grizly may use your IP address or browser language to determine which language to use when showing search results or advertisements.

## **Links to Other Sites**

The stories/sites displayed and/or linked to by the Grizly.com Service are developed by people over whom Grizly exercises no control. Other links are also on sites not controlled by Grizly. These other sites may send their own cookies to users, collect data, or solicit personal information. Grizly encourages you to read the privacy policy of all web sites you visit. Grizly may choose to exhibit its results in the form of a “URL redirecter.” When Grizly uses a URL redirecter, if you click on a URL on a Grizly page, information about the click is sent to Grizly, and Grizly in turn sends you to the site you clicked on. Grizly uses this URL information to understand and improve the quality of Grizly’s technology.

## **With Whom Does Grizly Share Information?**

Grizly may share information about you with advertisers, business partners, sponsors, and other third parties. However, we only divulge aggregate information about our users and will not share personally identifiable information with any third party without your express consent. For example, we may disclose how frequently the average Grizly user visits Grizly, or which Grizly pages are most often used. Please be aware, however, that we will release specific personal information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order. Further, Grizly reserves the right to cooperate with legitimate law enforcement requests for information at its sole discretion.

## **Children’s Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13.  If we learn that we have personal information on a child under the age of 13, we will delete that information from our systems.

## **Third Party Advertising**

Grizly uses third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use cookies or web beacons to collect non-personally identifiable information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services that may be of interest to you.

In addition, Grizly collects personally identifiable information from users (including email addresses, names, gender, date of birth, and zip code) during the registration process. This information may be used by Grizly to improve our site and the overall user experience.

Grizly may, through its website, iPhone applications and related sites, request your location via a geolocation service. Through this service Grizly may collect, depending on the capabilities of your device, information about the wifi routers closest to you, indentifying information related to the cell towersclosest to you, and the strength of your wifi or cell signal. Grizly will use this information to return an estimated location. This information (including your IP address) may then be used by Grizly to develop new features, products or services. This information may also be shared on an aggregated or individual basis with our third party advertisers to display better-targeted advertising content.

## **Your consent and changes to the Privacy Policy**

By using the Grizly Services and our web site, you consent to the collection and use of your information as we have outlined in this policy and to our Terms of Service Policy.
