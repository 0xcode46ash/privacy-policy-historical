# Privacy Policy

### Protecting Your Accounts

BECU never initiates requests for sensitive information by email (such as Social Security numbers, Telephone Banking PINs, passwords, or account numbers). If you receive an email requesting this type of information, please contact BECU immediately. [Report email fraud](mailto:phishing@becu.org). 

### Online Privacy Statement

BECU and our affiliates, BECU Trust Company and BECU Financial Services, Inc., ("We") believe that you are our most important asset. We work very hard to earn and maintain your trust. To do that, we believe that it is absolutely vital that we protect your privacy by keeping the information we have about you secure and confidential. BECU has not and will not sell your account information. 

We have policies and procedures in place to protect the safety of our personal and financial information. We restrict access to information about you only to employees, affiliated and non-affiliated service providers, to the extent permitted by law and to the extent necessary for the business purpose. This enables us to provide and offer products and services to you, service your accounts, and administer our business. We also have in place other physical, electronic and procedural safeguards that meet or exceed all federal regulations to protect your personal and account information, which are applied equally to current and former members and customers.

This Online Privacy Statement is part of, and is incorporated into BECU Account Agreement and our BECU Online Terms and Conditions. To see our General Privacy Statement, [click here](https://web.archive.org/pdfsource/GeneralPrivacyStatement.pdf).

  * Applications, forms and from your transactional history with us or others.
  * Your use of our Web site.

  * Third parties, such as companies that provide demographic information and other business transactions.



## Use of Information

In order to offer you useful products and services and to make our operations more cost effective (so that you benefit with higher deposit dividend rates and lower loan rates), we may at times, share some non-public information we have about you, as described above, with non-affiliated third parties such as: 

  * Financial service providers with whom we have joint marketing agreements, such as those that provide insurance services, investment securities, and mortgage and credit card servicing. 
  * Non-financial companies, such as credit reporting agencies, to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other companies who conduct or perform services on our behalf. 
  * Other companies or entities as necessary to comply with other legal requirements or as permitted by law.



## Honoring Your Preferences

BECU may send (or arrange for others to send) emails regarding surveys, focus-groups, promotions, and products and services offered by BECU or third parties. You are not required to complete online surveys or take advantage of promotions. If you do not want to receive those communications in the future, please contact us. If you enrolled in Online Banking, you agreed to our Electronic Communications Disclosure and therefore we may periodically send other disclosures and important information to you electronically. Such enrollment process did not include an opportunity to opt-out of receiving electronic communications from us; however, you may opt-out of receiving subsequent electronic communications at the time of receipt by selecting “unsubscribe”. 

## Children's Online Privacy

From our website, we do not knowingly collect or use personal information from children under 13.

Nothing in this Online Privacy Statement affects our ability to collect, combine, use, verify, retain, and report, including sharing with our regulators, information submitted in connection with the provision of products and services. We also reserve the right to do the same with information obtained from public sources or third parties, and other information that does not personally identify you, without reference to this Online Privacy Statement.
