# Website Privacy Policy - Bechtel

Bechtel Corporation - including its affiliates, divisions, business units and subsidiaries - ("Bechtel") recognizes and respects the privacy of users of this website.

## Collection and use

Bechtel collects no personally identifiable information about individuals except when specifically, and knowingly provided by such individuals for purposes disclosed to such individuals when they provide their information (such as voluntary submission of an email address for our news email update list). Except as otherwise allowed by this policy, Bechtel will not trade, sell, or rent personal information but may collect, or provide aggregate statistics about its site and users to other parties who do not provide services directly to Bechtel.

## Disclosures

Bechtel may disclose personally identifiable information about you or your use of this site if Bechtel has a good faith belief it is necessary to: (a) protect and defend the rights, property or safety of Bechtel, employees, other users of this site, or the public; (b) enforce the terms and conditions that apply to use of this site; (c) as required by a legally valid request from a competent governmental authority, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements; or (d) respond to claims that any content violates the rights of third-parties. We may also disclose personally identifiable information as we deem necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. For these purposes, we may, for example, disclose information about you to courts and litigation counterparties, insurers, the police and other competent governmental authorities.

As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. In such transactions, user information, including personally identifiable information, generally is one of the transferred business assets. Also, if either Bechtel itself or substantially all of Bechtel’s assets were acquired, personally identifiable information may be one of the transferred assets. Therefore, we may disclose and/or transfer personally identifiable information to a third party purchaser in these circumstances.
