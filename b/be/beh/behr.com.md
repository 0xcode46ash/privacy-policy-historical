## Privacy Policy

#### Behr Privacy Policy

Last Updated December 9, 2008

Behr Process Corporation, headquartered in Santa Ana, California ("Behr"), has created this Privacy Policy for www.behr.com in order to demonstrate its firm commitment to privacy. The following discloses Behr's information gathering and dissemination practices for the information collected through this site. We encourage you to read this Policy before using this site or submitting your personal information to us. Your use of this site signifies that you agree with all terms of this Policy, so please do not use this site if you disagree with any part of this Policy.

#### Personally Identifiable Information

We will collect personally identifiable information about you, such as your name, postal address, telephone and mobile numbers, and email address when you provide it to us while on this site such as when you create an account or profile, order or register a product, enter contests or incentive programs, sign up for newsletters, participate in a survey, contact customer service, or otherwise interact with this site. Your personally identifiable information may be used by us for all legal purposes, which may include, but are not limited to, responding to your requests, processing your transactions, notifying you of new products or product-related news, and for administrative purposes such as conducting incentive programs or tracking which parts of the site are of interest to you.

If you choose to opt-in, we may share your personally identifiable information with Behr's subsidiaries and affiliated entities ("Affiliated Entities") for purposes of sending you information about the programs of Behr or its Affiliated Entities and, occasionally, sending you advertising or promotional material from some of their advertising partners. We may also use your personally identifiable information for internal business purposes, such as optimizing users' site experiences and analyzing and managing our businesses. See the Opt-In/Choice section below.

We use your personally identifiable information to provide the services you request from Behr such as responding to product information requests; registering products; fulfilling orders for products or customer service; administering contests or incentive programs; and facilitating on-line product visualization applications and preferred products catalogs. We also use personally identifiable information to send you news about our products and promotions, to conduct on-line surveys, contests or incentive programs via email, telephone or postal mail, and to notify you of special events and advertising that you might be interested in. In addition, we may use the information to improve Behr's on-line and other services, such as customer service and product support, to understand consumer preferences in developing product improvements and innovations, and to ensure that our site is of interest to you. If you apply for employment with Behr, we use the personally identifiable information you supply to process your job application.

#### Notice Regarding Use of this Site by Children 

This site is not directed to children and we request that children do not provide personally identifiable information through the site.

#### Passive Collection of Non-Personal Information 

We may also collect other information that is non-personal in nature, such as your date of birth, gender, postal or zip code, domain name, URL, browser and operating system and a record of the site pages you visit. This data helps us to understand traffic patterns at this site and may be used to tailor your experience at this site, such as showing you content including special events and advertising that you might be interested in and displaying the content according to your postal code.

This site uses cookies, which are small bits of data that a web server transfers to an individual's computer for certain purposes, such as to report usage and demographic information, which may help us to know more about site users and their interests. Cookies are an industry standard used by most web sites to help facilitate users' ongoing access to and use of a particular web site, for example, by providing information used to deliver content specific to users' interests and for administrative purposes such as security, and which may track personally identifiable information. Generally, cookies can only be read by the server that delivers them. If you want to remove cookies from your computer at any time, you can delete or automatically decline them using your browser. Please refer to your browser instructions or help screen to learn more about these functions. You should note, however, that declining cookies may make it difficult or impossible for you to use portions of the site.

The site may use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") to compile aggregate statistics about site usage and response rates. Pixel Tags allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the site and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened. Behr only uses this technology in communications that users opt-in to receive and the information received by us will only be used in the aggregate for statistical analysis.

Behr collects non-personal information for internal use as aggregate information without identifying any particular user. Non-personal information may be compiled and shared with Affiliated Entities and strategic partners, merchants and advertisers. In some instances, we may combine non-personal information with personally identifiable information (such as embedding email addresses in cookies). If we do combine any non-personal information with personally identifiable information, the combined information will be treated by us as personally identifiable information in accordance with this Policy.

Some uses of cookies in connection with the site may be under the control of unaffiliated entities that Behr retains to manage certain programs and fulfill specific visitor requests. Although Behr requires these parties to conform their use of cookies to the uses permitted by this policy, Behr cannot be responsible for third party uses of cookies.

#### How We Share Personally Identifiable Information 

Behr may share personally identifiable information, including information that you provide on the site, with Affiliated Entities or third parties as described below. You should also be aware that this means that your personally identifiable information may be transferred to or received by Behr, Affiliated Entities or third parties in other countries, including the USA, which are subject to different privacy regulations than those applicable in the country where you reside. Although these laws may not be as comprehensive as those of your home country, Behr will take appropriate steps to ensure that your personally identifiable information is handled as described in this Policy.

  * **Affiliated Entities.** We may share personally identifiable information with our subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide for the purposes described above. You may access a list of certain Affiliated Entities at http://www.masco.com/our_companies/index.html.
  * **Service Providers.** We may use third party service providers to help us operate our business and this site or to administer activities on our behalf, such as sending emails, hosting dealer locater sites, providing order fulfillment, conducting advertising or customer service, and administering contests or incentive programs. We may share personally identifiable information with these third parties for those limited purposes. For instance, if you participate in a contest or incentive program resulting in a prize or award, we will share personally identifiable information about you with our merchandise fulfillment and management agencies.
  * **Dealers and Retailers.** We may share personally identifiable information with third parties that offer our products for sale. The third party dealer or retailer may contact you directly by email or postal mail. If you provide any personally identifiable information to such a third party through its web site or otherwise, your transaction will occur with the third party (and not on this site) and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. Behr recommends that you review the privacy policy of third parties who may contact you about Behr's or Affiliates' products.


  * **Other Disclosures.** Personally identifiable information of any individual user may be shared with other companies outside Behr: (i) as permitted by law; (ii) in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets or a bankruptcy of Behr; (iii) where we determine that disclosure of specific information is necessary to comply with the request of a law enforcement or regulatory agency or other legal process, or (iv) to protect the interests or safety of Behr, site visitors, customers, business partners, employees or the public; (v) to permit us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain (vi) to enforce our Terms of Use; and (vii) to respond to an emergency.
  * **Strategic Partners.** From time to time, we may enter into a special relationship with another company that is not owned by or affiliated with Behr to provide additional features on this site. These special relationships may include business partners, sponsors, and co-branded sites (referred to here as "co-branded pages"). Any information including personally identifiable information that you provide on one of these co-branded pages will be shared with these third party partners. By participating in activities or providing your information on these co-branded pages, you also consent to our providing your personally identifiable information to those third parties. Since these third parties will use your information in accordance with their own privacy practices, you should check their web sites for information regarding their privacy policies.



#### User Generated Content Functions 

Certain pages on this site enable users to submit their own content, such as under "Comments," or "Contact Us." Any information you disclose in such a submission may be publicly available and you should exercise caution in deciding whether to disclose your personal, financial or other sensitive information there. Behr cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Privacy Policy, the law, or your personal privacy and safety, and is not responsible for the results of any postings.

#### Sweepstakes, Contests, Etc. 

We may operate sweepstakes, contests, raffles and similar promotions through the site that may require online registration with third party sponsors of such sweepstakes, contests, raffles, etc. You should carefully review the rules of each sweepstakes, contest, raffle and promotion in which you participate through the site, as they may contain additional important information about Behr's or a sponsor's use of your personally identifiable information. To the extent that the terms and conditions of such rules concerning the treatment of your personally identifiable information conflict with this Policy, the terms and conditions of such rules shall control.

#### Links and Third Parties' Privacy Practices 

This site may contain links to other sites which are not operated by Behr. BEHR IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PRIVACY PRACTICES OR THE CONTENT OF SUCH OTHER WEB SITES, INCLUDING WEB SITES OPERATED BY AFFILIATED ENTITIES. We provide such links only as a convenience, and the inclusion of a link on the site does not imply endorsement of the linked site. If you provide any personally identifiable information through any such third party web site, your transaction will occur on such third party's web site (and not on this site) and the personally identifiable information you provide will be collected by, and controlled by the privacy policy of, that third party. Behr recommends that you review the privacy policy of third party web sites arrived at from links on this site.

#### Security of Personally Identifiable Information 

Behr will take appropriate measures to: (i) protect personally identifiable information collected against unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration or destruction, and (ii) keep personally identifiable information accurate and up-to-date, consistent with applicable law. We also seek to require our Affiliated Entities and service providers to exercise reasonable efforts to maintain the confidentiality of personally identifiable information about you. For on-line transactions, we use technology to protect the personally identifiable information that you transmit to us via our site. Unfortunately, however, no security system or system of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure.

For your own privacy protection, we encourage you not to include sensitive personal information in any emails you may send to us. Please do not send credit card numbers or any sensitive personal information to us via email. Note that Behr will not request sensitive personal information in our emails to you and you should be certain of the authenticity of any such request.

#### Opt-In/Choice 

This site may provide you with the opportunity to opt-in to receive marketing communications from Behr, its Affiliated Entities and other business partners. If you do not opt-in, you will not be sent promotional offers. However, regardless of your opt-in preferences, Behr may still at times need to send program emails for administrative reasons, such as those described in "How We Share Personally identifiable Information - Other Disclosures" above.

Behr also gives you convenient methods for removing your information from our database so as not to receive future communications or to close your account:

You may opt-out on the account profile page

Please note, however, that if you "opt-out" as described above, we will not be able to remove your personally identifiable information from the databases of Affiliated Entities or other business partners with which we have already shared your personally identifiable information as of the date of your opt-out request.

#### Changing Personally identifiable Information 

To the extent required by applicable law, you may be able to request that we inform you about the personally identifiable information we maintain about you and, where appropriate, request that we update, correct, and/or suppress personally identifiable information about you that we maintain in our active database. We will make all required updates and changes within the time specified by the applicable law and, where permitted by law, may charge an appropriate fee to cover the costs of responding to the request. Note that despite any request for removal of or change to personally identifiable information, we may need to retain certain information for recordkeeping purposes, and there may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records that will not be removed or changed.

Such requests must be submitted in writing through the Contact Us section on www.behr.com. To protect your confidentiality, we can only respond to such requests to the email address that you have registered or otherwise provided to us. Please remember that if you make such a request, we may not be able to provide you with the same quality and variety of services to which you are accustomed.

In addition, in some circumstances based on applicable law, you may request that we cease sharing personally identifiable information about you with our business partners or that Behr cease the use of personally identifiable information about you on the grounds that such information was acquired by unjust means or used in violation of law by sending your written request through the Contact Us section on www.behr.com. We will seek to honor those requests consistently with applicable law.

#### Retaining Personally Identifiable Information

We retain personally identifiable information about you for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by applicable law.

#### Policy Modifications

Behr reserves the right to make changes in this Policy. In the event that Behr makes a material change to this Policy, it will be posted here. We encourage you to check this page regularly since your continued use of this site following any changes to the Policy will be deemed to constitute your acceptance of such change.
