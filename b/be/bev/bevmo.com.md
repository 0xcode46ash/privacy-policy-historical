**BevMo! Privacy and Security Policy**

  
**Disclosure of Personal Information:**

BevMo.com is committed to keeping your personal information strictly confidential. When we collect your personal information (i.e. name, address, e-mail, telephone number, and credit card information) it is in an effort to improve your shopping experience and to notify you about our products, services, answer inquiries, and promotional information. It is our policy not to disclose any of your personal information at any time, unless you tell us to do so. We do not sell, trade or rent your personal information to third parties. From time to time, we'll share aggregated (collective) information about our members as a group, or generate aggregate reports and market research for business partners. These reports will not identify individual members. 

**Opting Out:**

BevMo.com may send you newsletters, special events and promotional offers via-email when you open up an account or become a ClubBev! member. If you do not wish to receive any of this information simply enter "NO" in the box marked "It's Ok to send me information" when you create an account. If you forget to enter this information and you receive an e-mail, you can click to the "Unsubscribe" link and be removed from our mailing list. 

**Cookies:**

Our site uses cookies to personalize and improve your shopping experience. These cookies do not contain any confidential or personal information. They allow us to enhance your shopping experience at BevMo.com. For example, if you have added products to your shopping cart and suddenly have to log out of our site, you can return later that day and still have those items in your shopping cart. 

**When you pick-up your order at one of our stores:**

We allow you the convenience of picking up your order at any of our store locations. When you arrive, please be prepared to positively identify yourself. This includes legal proof that you are over 21 (driver's license or passport). We also require that you bring the credit card you used to purchase goods on the site with you. This is an added security measure to reduce credit card fraud which helps us keep our prices so low. 

**Security:**

We use industry-standard methods to protect your information from unauthorized access. Among other techniques, we store such information on a computer behind our "firewall" in a secure location, and we restrict the number of employees internally who can access such data. To ensure the safety of your personal information, including your credit card number, we use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) Technology. SSL protects information as it crosses the Internet. Any data stored is kept in a secure off-site location and stored in a password-protected server. Please be aware, of course, that there is no such thing as perfect security - on or off the Internet. 

Please keep security in mind as you reach other websites through links from BevMo.com. Each separate company has its own privacy policies and practices and may market to you accordingly. Although we choose our business partners carefully, we can make no representations concerning privacy and security on those sites. 

We do not sell alcoholic beverages to anyone under the age of 21. We request that people under the age of 21 do not register on our site, or give us any information about themselves. 

Your password is your key to your account. You should never share it with anyone and we request that you change it periodically and often. You can change your password at any time by accessing “My ClubBev!” on our home page. If you can't remember your password, the reminder phrase you entered when you last changed or set-up your password will be e-mailed to you immediately. You may also 

[email us](https://web.archive.org/misc/CustomerService.aspx) for additional help. We strongly urge you to sign off your account and close your browser window when you have finished your shopping to prevent someone else from accessing your account. 

**Changing Personal Information:**

You may at any time modify or change any information you have previously provided to us by clicking on "My ClubBev!", then choose the appropriate section to edit, review, or delete your personal information. Changes will be updated immediately. You may also 

[email us](https://web.archive.org/misc/CustomerService.aspx) and we will be happy to change, modify or delete any information for you. 

**Changes in Policy:**

If you have any concerns or questions with respect to our Privacy Policy, please feel free to 

[contact us](https://web.archive.org/misc/CustomerService.aspx). By using this site, you are agreeing to the conditions of this Privacy Policy. DO NOT USE THIS SITE IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS PRIVACY POLICY. If we decide to change our Privacy Policy in whole or in part it will be posted on the site. Please check this page periodically for changes.
