#### We will never spam you.

    

We do send notifications for new and modified transactions, but you can turn these off.

Your friends may request that we send you a reminder to pay or collect outstanding debts, but this is only ever initiated by them - never by us. These messages cannot be customized, and so they cannot be used for spam.

#### We will never disclose your personal information without your permission.

    We will never sell, rent or share your personal information with a 3rd party, especially your email addresses and phone numbers, without your express permission, unless required by law. Never ever!

#### We give you full control over your information, including the ability to wipe it from our system.

    You can update your account information and preferences at any time. You can destroy your account when you choose. Details on what happens when accounts are destroyed can be found here.

#### We will only access your personal information when:

    You specifically request us to do so (e.g. you are having technical difficulties).  
It is required by law.   
It is necessary to maintain our system.

#### We will protect your information from other users.

    Nobody can see a bill unless they're part of it. You can only be added to a bill by someone who already knows how to get in touch with you via email or phone.

#### We may sell, rent or share information about user habits in aggregate only.

    We will never do so in a manner that could even remotely be individually identifiable.   
For example, we could collect and share information like "what is the average price of dinner for people aged 22-26 living in New York City when they go out with 3 or more friends?" but we would NOT share information like "what are the spending habits of one New Yorker aged 22-26?"
