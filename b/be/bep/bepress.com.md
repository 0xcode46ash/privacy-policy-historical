# Privacy Policy - bepress

“Bepress” and “Berkeley Electronic Press” are both D/B/A/s for Internet-Journals, Inc.

Bepress is intent on protecting your privacy. The following explains how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use of bepress products and services.

By “personal information” we mean information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.

This policy only applies to bepress and its employees.

### Information Collection and Use

When you open a bepress account, we ask for information such as your name, email address, institution, expertise and the like. This information may be combined with information we obtain from public sources, business partners, or other companies. Once you open an account with us, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. We may also collect other information when you visit bepress pages or the pages of certain bepress partners.

Security of such information is a high priority for us.

For some products we may also ask for your address or credit card information. Be assured that credit card information is encrypted and stored only on secure machines.

Bepress automatically receives and records information on our server logs from the information that your browser sends to us, including your IP address, cookies, and the page you request. While we may use your IP address to identify your institution and general location, we will not use your IP address to identify you in any way.

Bepress uses information to customize the content you see or are notified of. We use it to fulfill your requests for products and services. We use it to improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. Other uses include storing names of the reviewers of manuscripts submitted to journals and displaying these names for editors.

### Information Sharing and Disclosure

Bepress does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with bepress under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help bepress communicate with you about offers from bepress and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of bepress’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.
  * We transfer information about you if bepress is acquired by or merged with another company, including the sale of substantially all of its assets.
  * When you fill out an email form or contact form and provide information in the form, that information is viewable by the recipient and the administrators of the website where you filled out the form.  That information may also be stored by bepress and used for statistical purposes, or to improve our products.



### Cookies

Bepress may set and access cookies on your computer.

Bepress uses web beacons to access bepress cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with bepress products and services.

Bepress uses Google Analytics for tracking and analysis of website usage. Google Analytics relies on cookies to collect usage information such as pages visited, network location, hostname, referring web page, and device data. We use this information to gain insights into how the sites are used, with an eye toward how they could be improved for users.

Bepress sites may also use Google Analytics Demographics and Interest Reporting to access demographic information available via third-party cookies. This information is similarly used only to identify trends in the usage of the websites.

At any time, visitors may choose to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking with the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on.

### Editing Your Account Information and Preferences

We encourage you to edit your bepress account information, including your mailing preferences, at any time.

We reserve the right to send you certain communications relating to bepress service, such as service announcements or administrative messages that are considered part of your bepress account, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

### Confidentiality and Security

We limit access to personal information about you to employees who we believe reasonably need to come into contact with that information to provide products or services to you or in order to do their jobs.

We have physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal regulations to protect personal information about you.

### Changes to this Privacy Policy

Bepress may update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your bepress account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
