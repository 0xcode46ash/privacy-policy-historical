### Privacy Policy

The Berkeley Electronic Press (“bepress”) is intent on protecting your privacy. The following explains how we treat personal information that we collect and receive, including information related to your past use of bepress products and services. 

By “personal information” we mean information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available. 

This policy only applies to bepress and its employees.

### Information Collection and Use

When you open a bepress account, we ask for information such as your name, email address, institution, expertise and the like. This information may be combined with information we obtain from public sources, business partners, or other companies. Once you open an account with us, and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us. We may also collect other information when you visit bepress pages or the pages of certain bepress partners. 

Security of such information is a high priority for us.

For some products we may also ask for your address or credit card information. Be assured that credit card information is encrypted and stored only on secure machines. 

The Berkeley Electronic Press automatically receives and records information on our server logs from the information that your browser sends to us, including your IP address, cookies, and the page you request. 

The Berkeley Electronic Press uses information to customize the content you see or are notified of. We use it to fulfill your requests for products and services. We use it to improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. Other uses include storing names of the reviewers of manuscripts submitted to journals and displaying these names for editors.

  * We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with The Berkeley Electronic Press under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help The Berkeley Electronic Press communicate with you about offers from The Berkeley Electronic Press and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information. 
  * We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims. 
  * We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of The Berkeley Electronic Press's terms of use, or as otherwise required by law. 
  * We transfer information about you if The Berkeley Electronic Press is acquired by or merged with another company.
