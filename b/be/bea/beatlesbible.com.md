# Privacy policy | The Beatles Bible

The Beatles Bible takes your privacy seriously. This privacy policy describes what personal information we collect and how we use it.

**Firstly, a note from the site creator:**

This site uses various scripts and tracking mechanisms. However, absolutely no personal information is collected and retained by me. You will never be contacted by this site as a result of visiting, unless you get in touch yourself and your message requires a response. In honesty, I'd rather spend my time writing about The Beatles than crunching visitor data to devise complex and devious marketing strategies.

The tracking is used mainly for stats collection (WordPress and Google Analytics), to indicate which countries visitors are coming from, which pages are the most popular, how long people spend on the site and how many pages they click on. I don't really know much more than that; nor do I need to. I certainly don't know your name, phone number, email or postal address.

There are Twitter, Facebook and Google+ buttons for sharing content. These have to connect to your accounts to work, otherwise nothing can be shared. I don't get to see who you are or which pages you like, although I'm very grateful if you choose to share my content. The aforementioned services may use cookies to track browser behaviour, but these are not set by the Beatles Bible.

There are options to subscribe to keep up-to-date via Twitter, Facebook or email (the latter via Google's Feedburner). These are all third-party facilities and are optional, but please check the privacy policies of those sites if you're concerned about what they do. Again, I don't know who you are unless you choose to tell me (with the exception of Twitter, as the list of people following me is publicly accessible).

Lastly, the adverts on this site come from Google Adsense, iTunes and Amazon. Only the first of these uses targeting advertising to display appropriate content related to your browsing history. Again, I don't see or keep any of this information.

You're welcome to use adblockers or noscript add-ons, but please be aware that the Beatles Bible depends on advertising revenue to exist. This site is not a business - there is no multi-millionaire backer, just one person sharing his Beatles knowledge with the world. I love good web content as much as you do, but if everyone blocked the display of advertisements this site - and many others - would no longer be sustainable and its closure would be likely. I have tried to make the adverts as unobtrusive as possible, and have no plans to use popups, overlays or other annoyances.

TL;DR: I'm more interested in The Beatles than I am in spamming or tracking visitors to this site.

What follows is more of a standard message to comply with Google Adsense's terms and conditions.
