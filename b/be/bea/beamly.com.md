# zeebox - Privacy and Cookies

## Who we are

Zeebox Inc. is a corporation incorporated in Delaware, USA with its principal office at 84 Wooster Street, Suite 703, New York, NY 10012, USA. 

We are committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of our website located at http://zeebox.com ( **"Site"** ), the zeebox digital app ( **"App"** ), our **"** **Software"** (which includes the software we developed to run our App, any related documentation or data distributed to you and any future fixes, updates and upgrades), and the various services that we provide ( **"Service"** ) (we refer to the Site, the App, the Software and the Service collectively as **"zeebox"** ). 

This Privacy and Cookies Policy ( **"Privacy Policy"** ) sets out how we deal with data we collect from you when you are using or accessing zeebox. It also covers our treatment of any data that our business partners share with us or that we share with our business partners. 

## What data do we collect?

We may collect "personal data" (data that identifies you). For example, when you download zeebox, you will be asked to create a zeebox account by registering with your name, email address, a password and your date of birth (or using your Facebook account log in details). You may also choose to connect to a third party social networking service (e.g. Twitter or Facebook) via zeebox which authorizes us to interact with your accounts including for the purpose of accessing and publishing data (e.g. your image, your tweets) within zeebox as well as on these third party services. It is our policy not to ask you for personal data that we don't really need. 

We may also collect non-personal data. For example, we may track and compile data with respect to general viewing trends / Site usage on a non-personally identifiable basis. When you visit our Site or use the App we may automatically log your IP (internet protocol) address which is a unique identifier for your computer or other access device. This will typically tell us the date and time of your visit to our Site, your choice of ISP (internet service provider) and your geographic location. Other non-personal data, such as randomly assigned numeric identifiers, may be collected by our partners for statistical purposes. Non-personal data relating to application usage such as the kind of mobile devices our users use, the operating system on our users’ mobile devices, when the App is downloaded and how and how often the App is used may be collected by our analytics service providers through receiving and storing users’ unique device identifiers such as the Apple Advertising Identifier (a non-permanent, non-personal device identifier associated with users’ Apple mobile devices). All of this information is used by us internally for the purpose of understanding how zeebox is being used and improving the App. 

Some features of zeebox allow you to provide content to zeebox, such as written comments. All content submitted by you to the zeebox may be retained by us indefinitely, even after you terminate your account. We may continue to disclose such content to third parties in a manner that does not reveal personal information, as described in this Privacy Policy.

## How do we use the data we collect?

### Personal data

Information about your viewing habits and information you post is shared with the public according to the preferences accepted or set by you when you join zeebox or updated by you at a later time under the Settings menu. Your profile is visible to your friends in accordance with your settings.

If you submit any information to zeebox by way of posting or tweeting, you should have no expectation of privacy with respect to any such submission. Please keep in mind that whenever you give out personal information online, that information can be collected and used by people you don’t know. We cannot guarantee the security of any information you disclose online; you make such disclosures at your own risk.

We may collect other personal data from you so that we can provide zeebox to you and enhance your experience of zeebox. For example, we may use your previous viewing habits to recommend other programming to you and to make you aware of special offers, new products or services or functionality changes relating to zeebox. We may personalize your repeat visits to our Site and formulate our marketing on our Site so that it is targeted based on your television viewing or online behavior. We may use your personal data to contact you and, if you agree, to enable our affiliates/partners/advertisers to contact you. For example, we may contact you to give you notices about your zeebox account, app updates, new zeebox services and features or to fulfil the purpose of a zeebox feature (such as when you click on the “Follow” Button on our (or on certain of our partners’) website, you automatically elect to allow us and/or certain of our partners to contact you via email with feeds and reminders about the shows you are following). We may also use your personal data to contact you about certain of our partners’ services that may be of interest to you. If you do not want us to use your information in this way, please adjust your Alert Settings in your account profile or email us at info@zeebox.com.

### Non-personal data

We may use anonymous data collected from zeebox for site administration, analytics, advertising and promotional purposes, and we may share such information with other entities (such as service providers) for such purposes. We may also aggregate data to enable research or analysis so that we can better understand and serve you and others. For example, we may conduct research on your demographics and viewing behavior. Although this aggregated data may be based in part on personal data, it does not identify you personally. zeebox may share this type of anonymous data with others, including service providers, our affiliates, agents and current and prospective business partners. We may use your anonymous data outside of zeebox to improve third party marketing or use your data in combination with third party data to improve your experiences both in and outside zeebox. We may retain your IP address and/or other device-identifying data in order to help us diagnose problems with our servers, to administer zeebox including personalizing content or links relevant to your geographic area or device-type, to verify that your account is not being used by others, to gather broad anonymous demographic data (such as the number of visitors from a geographic area), to enforce compliance with our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/help/terms-of-use) or otherwise in order to protect our services, Sites, customers, or other third parties.

We use analysis tools including Mixpanel and Flurry Analytics. These provide us with information about how our users use the App. Mixpanel and Flurry Analytics use the data they collect (such as platform, application version, device identifier, device model, manufacture and operating system version, session stop/start time, location, time zone and network status (e.g. WiFi)) to create reports for us to analyze our user base and improve the app. 

## What control do I have over zeebox's use of my personal data?

We want you to retain as much control as possible over your personal data and your use of zeebox generally. You may use certain zeebox features without any registration. If you would like us to delete/correct personally identifiable data, let us know and we will action your request as soon as practicable. If you would like to dictate what is published and what others can see, please update your preferences accordingly. If you would like to modify the ways we access and use data we obtain as a result of our interaction with third party login services such as Twitter or Facebook, please change your app settings on these third party login services. 

Make sure you keep your account and password secure and that access to your device is protected by password. Your account information will be protected by a password for your privacy and security. You need to prevent unauthorized access to your account and personal information by selecting and protecting your password appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and by signing off after you have finished accessing your account. 

If you are a registered user, you can access information associated with your account by logging into zeebox. 

_California Privacy Rights_ : Under California Civil Code sections 1798.83-1798.84, California residents are entitled to ask us for a notice identifying the categories of personal customer information which we share with our affiliates and/or third parties for marketing purposes, and providing contact information for such affiliates and/or third parties. If you are a California resident and would like a copy of this notice, please submit a written request to the following address: 84 Wooster Street, Suite 703, New York, NY 10012, USA. Email: [info@zeebox.com](mailto:info@zeebox.com) . 

## Will we share your data with third parties?

We may share non-personal data with third parties to, for example (but not by way of limitation), improve zeebox and to enable data aggregation (as described above). 

With your consent, we may share your personal data with subcontractors (only when necessary), our affiliates and/or partners (subject to confidentiality obligations to use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them and pursuant to our instructions) and advertisers. For example, our partners may use your email address to contact you in relation to your favourite shows. We will require our partners to allow you to notify them if you want to opt-out from receiving any such emails or other promotional materials from them. If you do not want to receive such emails from our partners, please contact them directly or use the relevant ‘Unsubscribe’ link in our partners’ emails (or our partners’ opt-out mechanism, as applicable). 

We may also share personal data with interested parties in the event that zeebox anticipates a change in control or the acquisition of all or part of our business or assets or with interested parties in connection with the licensing of our technology.

If zeebox is sold or makes a sale or transfer, we may, in our sole discretion, transfer, sell or assign your personal data to a third party as part of or in connection with that transaction. Upon such transfer, the Privacy Policy of the acquiring entity may govern the further use of your personal data. In all other situations your data will still remain protected in accordance with this Privacy Policy (as amended from time to time).

We may share your personal data at any time if required for legal reasons or in order to enforce our [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/help/terms-of-use) or this Privacy Policy.

## How does zeebox protect customer data?

zeebox is concerned with keeping your data secure and protecting it from inappropriate disclosure. We implement a variety of security measures to ensure the security of your personal data on our systems. Any personal data collected by us is contained behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of employees who have special access rights to such systems. Where sensitive data is collected by us it will be transmitted and protected via Secure Socket Layer technology and HTTPS protocol and encrypted in our databases to be accessed only as stated above. If and when we use subcontractors to store your data, we will not relinquish control of your personal data or expose it to security risks that would not have arisen had the data remained in our possession. However, unfortunately, no transmission of data over the internet is guaranteed to be completely secure. It may be possible for third parties not under the control of zeebox to intercept or access transmissions or private communications unlawfully. While we strive to protect your personal data, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any personal data you transmit to us. Any such transmission is done at your own risk. If you believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure, please contact us. 

## Cookies

Cookies are small files of letters and numbers downloaded onto your computer or access device when you access certain websites. The use of cookies is standard on the internet and many websites use them to improve the user experience. There are different types of cookies (described further below). For more information about cookies and how they work see [allaboutcookies.org](http://www.allaboutcookies.org/)

BY USING ZEEBOX, YOU AGREE THAT WE CAN PLACE THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF COOKIES ON YOUR DEVICE :

(a) **Strictly necessary cookies** – These cookies make our Site work. These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around our Site and use our features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies, we would not be able to remember your previous actions, determine whether you are logged in or not or enable you to see the electronic programme guide tailored to your chosen provider/region. 

(b) **Performance cookies** – These cookies improve the performance of our Site. These cookies collect information about how visitors use our Site, for instance which pages visitors go to most often, and if visitors get error messages from web pages. These cookies don’t identify you personally. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and anonymous. These cookies enable us to manage errors and the performance and design of the Site, to track ad response rates and your visits to our affiliate websites, and to show you which shows are most popular. 

(c) **Functionality cookies** – These cookies save you time. These cookies remember your user name and can also be used to remember settings that you can customise. These cookies allow us to remember choices you make (e.g. whether you want to share your activity on Facebook) and provide enhanced, more personal features. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as watching a video or commenting. Without these cookies, we won’t be able to distinguish you from other users and, as a result, save you time. We also won’t be able to remember your family mode setting (which allow you to hide profane tweets). 

(d) **Targeting or advertising cookies** – These cookies make the advertising you see relevant. These cookies are used to deliver adverts or links more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the number of times you see an ad as well as help measure the effectiveness of ad campaigns. They may be placed by us, or advertising networks with our, or our affiliate’s, permission. Without these cookies, you may still receive advertising – the advertising, however, will be less relevant to you. 

(e) **Third party cookies** \- Our Site allows third parties to set cookies on your device (e.g. Facebook and Twitter). This means that when we display content or widgets from a third party (e.g. from a streaming video service) this third party may set their own cookies or similar technologies onto your device. We do not control the use of such cookies and in many instances have no access to the data collected by these third parties. Third party use of cookies is subject to their respective privacy policies. 

### How to manage cookies

If you are aged 13-18 you should have a parent’s or guardian’s approval to use zeebox and review our Terms with a parent or guardian to make sure you and your parent/guardian understand them. 

If you are under 18, and you access zeebox by lying about your age, or are otherwise in breach of our Terms and this Privacy Policy,you must immediately stop using zeebox and terminate your Account. We will block your access to zeebox if we determine that you are misrepresenting your age or in breach of these Terms.

zeebox is not directed at children under 13. If you become aware that your child has been using zeebox without your consent, please contact us at info@zeebox.com. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If we become aware that a child has provided us with personal data, we will take steps to remove such information and terminate the child’s account. 

If you become aware that your child under 13 has provided any of our partners with personal data without your consent, you may elect to notify such partner directly and request that it remove or destroy any personal information in its possession concerning your child. zeebox cannot be responsible for ensuring that our partners remove or destroy such personal information. However, zeebox requires its partners to agree to remove or destroy such personally identifiable information if requested to do so.

## Third party links and co-brand relationships

In an attempt to enhance users' experiences of zeebox, we may choose various third party websites to link to, and frame within zeebox. We also participate in co-branding and other relationships to offer e-commerce and other services and features to our users. However, even if the third party is affiliated with us, we have no control over these linked sites, each of which has separate privacy and data collection practices independent of us. Data collected by our co-brand partners or third party web sites (even if offered on or through zeebox) is not received by us. As such, we have no responsibility or liability for the treatment of your data by these sites. These linked sites are for your convenience and you access them at your own risk. When you sign into zeebox using a third party login service (e.g. Twitter or Facebook), your use is also subject to these third party’s Privacy Policies and in accordance with your account settings with these third parties. 

## Transfer of Business Assets

In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, user information is typically one of the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.

## International transfer of data

Your information may be stored and processed in the US or other countries or jurisdictions outside the US where zeebox has facilities. We are currently storing data in the EU and so, by using zeebox, you are permitting and consenting to the transfer of information, including personal data, outside of the US.
