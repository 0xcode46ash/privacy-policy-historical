# BearingPoint - Privacy policy

## Privacy policy

BearingPoint’s privacy and data protection practices on the web. This notice describes the privacy and data protection practices for web sites of BearingPoint Inc and its affiliates (“BearingPoint”), such as the type of information gathered and tracked on bearingpoint.com and linked BearingPoint sites, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared.

**Links to Other Sites**

This privacy statement applies only to information collected by a BearingPoint web site.

The BearingPoint web site contains links to other sites that are not owned or administered by BearingPoint. Please be aware that BearingPoint is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other third party sites. We encourage you to read the privacy statements of every web site you visit.

**Active and Passive Collection**

On our sites, we collect information in two ways: actively and passively. Active information collection refers to instances in which you voluntarily provide information to us, such as by completing a registration form, signing up for an electronic newsletter, or sending us a message via an e-mail reply mechanism provided by any of our sites. Passive information collection refers to instances in which we collect information from you that you have not actively provided.

Generally, collected information can be in a personally identifiable form (“personal data” or “personally identifiable information”) as well as in a manner that does not allow you to be identified.

**Collection and Use of the Personal Data You Provided To Us**

You can visit most of our sites without disclosing your personally identifiable information and we do not collect personal data from you unless you may choose to voluntarily provide it to us. When a visitor chooses to provide personally identifiable information to BearingPoint, BearingPoint uses this information solely for the purposes for which it was provided as described at the time of collection. For example, you may choose to provide us with your name and postal or e-mail address to correspond with you or to provide you with the service or information you requested but we will not contact you for any unrelated reasons. If you give us personal information about somebody else, we assume that you have that person’s permission to do so.

We generally retain personal data only for as long as necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected.

**Personal data submitted online through our global careers portal**

Personal data you submitted in connection with your application to be considered for employment is kept on file as long as the information is necessary to complete the employment application process, for as long as required by law, until the employment application is no longer under consideration, or until you request that such information be disposed of, whichever comes first. If the employment application process does not result in employment, BearingPoint may keep the application on file for future reference, unless the applicant requests it to be removed. By submitting personal data through the BearingPoint web site, the visitor is providing explicit consent to the cross-border transmission of this information.

Please be advised that if you join BearingPoint, BearingPoint may share the information you provided to us during the recruitment process with third parties assisting BearingPoint in the administration and management of your employment relationship with BearingPoint such as a payroll management companies, pension plan companies, health insurance companies or agencies, credit card companies and other BearingPoint agents and services providers and that your personal data may be transferred globally to be processed. 

If you have questions regarding your personal data in connection with our recruitment sites, please contact us and indicate that your inquiry relates to recruitment.

BearingPoint does not generally seek to collect and discourages applicants and visitors of its sites to provide sensitive personal data. Sensitive personal data includes information such as information about a person’s private life, racial and ethnic origin, religious and philosophical beliefs, pregnancy and physical or mental disabilities. If you choose to provide such information, you explicitly consent that BearingPoint processes it as part of its ordinary recruitment process. Please note that BearingPoint may be required by local law to solicit certain personal information such as ethnicity or gender from applicants.

**Information We Collect when You Access our Sites**

When you access our sites, our servers automatically log information about your visits in the normal course of establishing and maintaining web connections. Server logs record statistical information, such as visitors' IP addresses, type of operating systems, time and duration of visit, web pages requested, and identify categories of visitors by items such as domains and browser types. These statistics are reported in aggregate form and are used to optimize the web experience for visitors. 

This site uses Internet protocol (IP) addresses. IP addresses are unique identifiers automatically assigned to each computer when logging onto the Internet. IP addresses allow us to collect much of the same information we collect through cookies, including browser type, what pages you visit, and how long you stay on the Site. In general, IP addresses allow us to identify problems with our servers, prepare aggregate demographic information and other information regarding this use of this Site, and improve the functions of this site.

We use “cookies” and other technologies to collect personally non-identifiable information from your visits to our website to enhance your overall site experience and for statistical purposes. A cookie is a block of data that a web server places on a user’s PC. Typically, it is used to ease navigation through the site. However, it is also a useful means of the website identifying the user, tracking the user’s path through the site, and identifying repeat visits to the site by the same user (or same user’s machine). This can then lead to a website owner being able to profile an individual user’s browsing habits - and all potentially done without the knowledge, or consent, of the user. 

Most browsers can be set to prevent cookies being downloaded onto a PC. You can look into the “cookie” or “Temporary Internet” folder of your PC and see if you can identify a cookie placed by your site. Cookies often, but not always, contain site names. However, if you turn off the “cookies”, some websites may not work properly. 

We employ a technique called data tagging to collect web site traffic information. Data tagging works by embedding tags on the website that transmit relevant data to a centralized data collection facility. The data tags are a small piece of JavaScript code that transmits page-specific information via query string parameters. We do not tie the information gathered by data tagging to our visitors’ personally identifiable information. 

We generally do not link passively collected non-personally identifiable information with personal data you have actively provided elsewhere on any of our sites. We do not link server log information to any other data in a way that would enable us to identify individual visitors. However, we may review server logs for security purposes, for example, to detect threats to our IT system. Please be advised that it is possible for server log data containing IP addresses to be used in instances of suspected criminal activities to identify an individual. In such instances, raw data logs may be shared with authorized law enforcement agencies.

**Global Transfer**

BearingPoint has business operations and affiliates world-wide. When information is collected and processed over the Internet, it usually involves transferring data internationally. Given the international nature of the Internet and BearingPoint, personal data collected on our site may therefore be transferred and shared amongst BearingPoint affiliates globally. Some countries may provide for less legal protection of your personal data than your home jurisdiction. BearingPoint binds its global affiliates with contractual safeguards to a level deemed adequate under the EU Data Protection Directive in case of a data transfer from one of its EU affiliates. Our privacy practices as described here are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for your personal data. By browsing our site and communicating electronically with us you demonstrate your consent to the global transfer and processing of your personal data in accordance with our Privacy Statement.

**Disclosure to Third Parties**

BearingPoint does not share personal data provided by visitors of BearingPoint web sites with external third parties unless explicitly requested by the visitor. We sometime provide information to other companies that work on our behalf in order to help deliver publications or services as requested by a visitor or to facilitate the purpose for which the personal data was received. BearingPoint’s website is hosted on servers owned and operated by a third party. These third party agents are required to keep personal information confidential and are prohibited from using it for any unrelated purpose.

BearingPoint does not use personal data collected from its websites to facilitate unsolicited marketing activities. 

Please be aware that it is possible that personal data you provide to BearingPoint may be subject to disclosure under the law (e.g., pursuant to a statutory provision, a court order, or a subpoena) or in case BearingPoint needs to defend its rights.

Access, Correction and Deletion of Personal Data   
You have the right to reasonably access your personal data collected by BearingPoint and we will provide you with a possibility to verify that your personal data is accurate and up to date. You can request access, correction and deletion of your personal information by [contacting us here](mailto:contact%40bearingpoint.com). We will use reasonable efforts to accommodate your request. To update or delete your data or correct an inaccuracy, we may ask you to verify your identity.

In case you chose to be on a mailing list for periodic email updates regarding BearingPoint services and events, you can [contact us here](mailto:contact%40bearingpoint.com) if you no longer want to receive such communications. We will make reasonably efforts to honor your choice and refrain from sending you such announcements in the future as soon as possible. 

**Security of Your Personal Data**

BearingPoint takes various organizational and technical steps to protect your personal data from unauthorized or unintended use or disclosure. However, you should note that no transfer of data over the internet is completely secure. While we use reasonable efforts to protect personal data under our control, when data is transferred over the Internet it may potentially be accessed and used by unauthorized parties. BearingPoint has no control over the performance or security of the Internet and does not warrant that any communication through the Internet is secure and is not liable for any damages resulting from a data breach due to any reason beyond BearingPoint’s reasonable control. 

**Changes in this Privacy Statement and How to Contact Us**

We may modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to our privacy practices, we will notify you here or by means of a notice on our home page.

If you have questions regarding our web privacy practices and the protection of your personal data collected through our website, please [contact us here](mailto:contact%40bearingpoint.com).
