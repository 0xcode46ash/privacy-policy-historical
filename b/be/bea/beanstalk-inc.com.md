# Privacy Policy | Beanstalk-inc.com

We take your right to privacy and to protect the information you give us very seriously. While the basic rule at Beanstalk Search Engine Positioning is essentially, if it's about a client - it stays at work, we feel it's necessary to outline clearly what this means for you.

**Privacy For Our Newsletter Subscribers**  
We receive email addresses from people wishing to subscribe to "Climbing The Beanstalk", our bi-weekly newsletter of search engine news and positioning strategies. These emails are kept confidential and are used for no other purpose than to send our newsletter to our subscribers.

**If you wish to subscribe to "Climbing The Beanstalk" simply enter your email address in the right-hand column of this page.**

**Privacy For Those Requesting Reviews**  
Search engine positioning reviews give us an opportunity to demonstrate to our visitors how search engine positioning works, how it can help their website, and to give them an idea of how we work and what sorts of things we are looking at. In requesting a review we require some personal and site information such as contact information, website address, targeted keyword phrases, etc. This information is used for no other purpose than to provide those requesting one with a custom search engine positioning review.

None of this information leaves Beanstalk Search Engine Positioning with the sole exception of the review that we send to the email address given to us.

**[Submit your website for a search engine positioning review](https://web.archive.org/search-engine-positioning/review.htm)**

**Privacy For Our Search Engine Positioning Clients**  
There is no more serious offence that can be made by a search engine positioning firm that to share the information given to them by a client with those outside the company. We realize that the information that we receive as SEO's can be extremely confidential and often includes credit card information, FTP information and more. This information will be kept in the hands of [Mary Davies, of Beanstalk Search Engine Positioning](https://web.archive.org/search-engine-positioning/about-us.htm) and will be given to staff solely on a need-to-know basis (for example, the SEO working on your site will need FTP access to your server).
