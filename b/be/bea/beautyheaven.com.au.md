# Beauty Heaven - Privacy Policy

Directories Group P/L (Directories Group) treats the privacy of your Personal Information very seriously.

To ensure the Privacy of your Personal Information, we have developed this Privacy Policy to comply with the Privacy Act 1998. (“the Privacy Act”)

Directories Group is bound by the National Privacy Principles which are set out in the Privacy Act. This Policy should be read together with those Principles.

### Collection of Personal Information

Personal Information is information or an opinion (including information or opinion forming a database), whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an individual whose identity is apparent or can be reasonably ascertained from the information or opinion.

From time to time, we may collect information that is personal information.

For example, we may collect personal information when you complete a registration form or enter competitions. We may also collect personal information by the use of “Cookies”. Cookies enable us to assign a unique permanent identifier to a computer that can be used to associate the requests made to our website from a particular computer. If you wish, you may be able to disable the use of Cookies by changing the settings on your Internet Browser, or using software products that will reject or manage Cookies for you.

We will only collect personal information when it is necessary for us to do so, for conducting market research in relation to consumer preferences. (which we call the “primary purpose”)

We will only collect your personal information by lawful and fair means and not in an unreasonably intrusive way.

Before you provide us with your personal information, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that you are aware of our “Collection Statement”. (provide hyperlink)

As you are providing information to us through this website, it is not reasonable and practicable for us to obtain the personal information directly from you.

We do not ordinarily obtain personal information about an individual from someone else. In the event that we do, we will take reasonable steps to ensure that the individual has been made aware of our “Collection Statement”, except to the extent when making the individual aware of the matters would pose a serious threat to the life or health of the individual.

### Use and Disclosure

The primary purpose of us collecting personal information is for market research in relation to consumer preferences. We may disclose this information to organisations that advertise their products and services on our website for evaluation.

We may also use your personal information for direct marketing, for example, to send you our Newsletter (which we call our “secondary purpose”). The personal information may also be used by organisations that advertise their products and services on our website for the purpose of direct marketing (see When we send personal information overseas below).

We will not use your personal information other than for these purposes.

If we use the information for the secondary purpose of Direct Marketing, we will:

  1. where practical, seek your consent to the use of personal information for that use; and



  2. we will not charge you for giving effect to a request by you to us, not to receive direct marketing communications; and



  3. you have not made a request to us not to receive direct marketing communications; and



  4. in each direct marketing communication with you, we will draw your attention, prominently display a notice, that you may express a wish not to receive any further direct marketing communication; and



  5. each written direct marketing communication by us with you (up to and including the communication that involves the use), sets out our business address and telephone number and, if the communication with you is made by fax, telex or other electronic means, a number or address at which we can be directly contacted electronically.




We do not collect health information as defined in the Privacy Act about you.

### The quality of information.

We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date.

Our ability to ensure that any personal information that we hold is accurate, complete and up to date will depend on the following things:

  1. the accuracy and the completeness of the information that you give to us;
  2. the fact that some personal information may change over time;
  3. the fact that this information is not provided to us by you in person.



### Security of information

We will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed as set out above.

### Openness

This Policy sets out how we manage your personal information. If you are unable to print a hard copy of this policy, please contact us and we will forward a copy to you upon request. Should you request, we will take reasonable steps to let you know generally what sort of personal information we hold, for what purposes and how we collect, hold, use and disclose the information.

### Access and correction

We will provide you access to the information that we hold on request by you, except to the extent that:

  1. in the case of personal information other than health information – providing access would impose a serious, imminent threat to the life or health of any individual, or;



  2. providing access would have an unreasonable impact upon the privacy of other individuals; or



  3. the request for access is frivolous or vexatious; or



  4. the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings between us and you; and the information would not be accessible by the process of discovery in those Proceedings; or



  5. providing access would reveal the intentions of the organisation in relation to the negotiations with the individual in such a way as to prejudice those negotiations;



  6. providing access of the unlawful; or



  7. denying access is required or authorised by or under law; or



  8. providing access would be likely to prejudice an investigation of possible, unlawful activity;



  9. providing access would be likely to prejudice:



    1. prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution or punishment of criminal offences, breaches of a law imposing a penalty or sanction or breaches of the prescribed law;

    2. the enforcement of laws relating to the confiscation of the proceeds of crime; or

    3. the protection of the public revenue;

    4. the prevention, detection, investigation or remedying of seriously improper conduct or prescribed conduct;

    5. the preparation for all conduct of Proceedings before any Court or Tribunal, or implementation of its orders;

    6. by or on behalf of an enforcement body;



  10. an enforcement body performing a lawful security function may ask the organisation not to provide access to the information on the basis that providing access would likely cause damage to the security of Australia.




Should we provide access to you and that would reveal evaluative information generated within our organisation in connection with a commercially sensitive decision making process, we may give you an explanation for the commercially sensitive decision rather than the direct access.

If we are not required to give you access to the information because of one of the reasons stated above, we will, if reasonable, consider whether the use of a mutually agreed intermediatory would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both Parties.

We may charge you for providing access to personal information, but those charges will not be excessive and will not apply to lodging a request for access.

If we hold personal information about you and you are able to establish to us that the information we hold is not accurate, incomplete and up to date, we will take reasonable steps to correct the information, so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

If there is a disagreement about whether the information is accurate, complete and up to date, and you ask us to associate with the information a statement claiming the information is not accurate, complete or up to date, we will take reasonable steps to do so.

Should we deny access to personal information or refuse to correct your personal information, we will provide you with reasons.

### Anonymity

Wherever it is lawful and practicable, we will give you the option of not identifying yourself when entering transactions with us.

### When we send personal information overseas

As part of our primary purpose, we may disclose personal information about you to organisations in a foreign country that advertise products and services on our website.

We will not disclose personal information to an organisation in a foreign country, unless we are satisfied that we believe that the organisation in the foreign country is subject to a law, binding scheme or a contract which effectively up holds principles for fair handling of the information that are substantially similar to the National Privacy Principles as contained in the Privacy Act, or you otherwise consent to us giving this information.

We will not allow the organisations in a foreign country to send you direct marketing material about its products or services, unless you otherwise consent.
