# Privacy Policy | beautyheaven

Updated July 2014

Welcome to www.beautyheaven.com.au ("Site").

This Privacy Policy applies to the activities of beautyheaven Pty Limited (ABN 19128545620) (“we” or “our”).  We treat the privacy of your Personal Information very seriously.

### Collection of Personal Information

From time to time, we may collect your personal information. We will only collect personal information when it is necessary for us to do so in order to conduct market research in relation to consumer preferences or for direct marketing or to enable you to register and obtain logon details for contribution to the Site’s discussion forums. When you use the Site, information about how you use the Site may be collected by us. We may also collect personal information from you if you complete a registration form or enter a competition. You do not have to provide this information. This may mean you will not be able to use some of our services or enter competitions. The categories of personal information we may request when you register or interact with the Site include your name, user name, and contact information (email, address and phone number), product preferences and other marketing information.

We may also collect personal information by the use of “Cookies”. Cookies enable us to assign a unique permanent identifier to a computer that can be used to associate the requests made to our website from a particular computer. If you wish, you may be able to disable the use of Cookies by changing the settings on your Internet Browser, or using software products that will reject or manage Cookies for you.

If you contact us, we may keep a record of that contact.

### Use and Disclosure

We will use your personal information to enable us to operate the Site, including the operation and, moderation, of discussion forums that are provided on the Site from time to time.

Personal information in aggregated and de-identified form may be used to develop statistics about the profile of users and readers of the Site and this information may be used to improve the quality and relevance of the Site to its users. It may also help us select products and services which we feature and discuss on the Site.

We may disclose your personal information to organisations that advertise their products and services on our website for evaluation. Your personal information may also be used by our affiliates, or, organisations that advertise their products and services on our website, for the purpose of direct marketing of products and services (and for the opportunity of participating in product trials from time to time) unless you indicate that you wish to opt-out of receiving such marketing and product trial information.

Content and reviews that you upload to our website (and any information about you that you disclose therein), and, only your username, age and the country, state or territory where you live (as per the information you provided in your website user profile), may be disclosed, at our discretion, to third party hair, cosmetic and beauty organisations for use in their marketing activities and materials. These organisations may be overseas.

Apart from the above, we will not use or disclose any information about you without your consent, unless:

required by law;

we believe it necessary to provide you with a service which you have requested;

to implement our terms of service;

to protect the rights, property or personal safety of another Site user, any member of the public or us; or

the assets and operations of the business are transferred to another party as a going concern.

### Direct Marketing

You acknowledge and agree that we may contact you at the email or other address which you provide to us in order to:

provide you with direct marketing information; or

provide you with other information about our products and services which you may enjoy.

If you receive promotional information from us or one of our affiliates and do not wish to receive this information any longer, you may remove your name from our list either by visiting our website and following the instructions on how to withdraw your information from that site (where that facility is available), or emailing us at diana@beautyheaven.com.au and asking to be removed from our mailing list. Please allow 10 business days for this request to be processed.

### The quality of information

We will take reasonable steps to make sure that the personal information we collect, use or disclose is accurate, complete and up to date.

### Storage and Security of information

We will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information we hold from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure.  Personal information that we hold will be stored on servers operated by us or by our third party service providers engaged to provide storage services in accordance with good industry practice.

Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot give an absolute assurance that the information you provide to us will be secure at all times.  We will not be held responsible for events arising from unauthorised access to your personal information.

We will take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or disclosed as set out above.

### Openness

 This Policy sets out how we manage your personal information. If you are unable to print a hard copy of this policy, please contact us on info@beautyheaven.com.au and we will forward a copy to you upon request.

### Access and correction

We will provide you access to the information that we hold on request by you. If at any time you want to know exactly what personal information we hold about you, you are welcome to access your record by emailing us at info@beautyheaven.com.au. Our file of your information will be made available to you within 14 days.  We will only withhold your access to such information in limited circumstances where it is permitted by law.

If we are not required to give you access to the information because of one of the reasons stated above, we will, if reasonable, consider whether the use of a mutually agreed intermediatory would allow sufficient access to meet the needs of both parties.

We may charge you for providing access to personal information. If at any time you wish to change personal information that is inaccurate or out of date, please contact us by emailing us at info@beautyheaven.com.au and we will amend this record. You may also enquire about your personal information at (02) 9555 9520. If you wish to have your personal information deleted, please let us know in the same manner as referred to above and we will take all reasonable steps to delete it unless we need to keep it for legal reasons.  If we hold personal information about you and you are able to establish to us that the information we hold is not accurate, incomplete and up to date, we will take reasonable steps to correct the information, so that it is accurate, complete and up to date.

Should we deny access to personal information or refuse to correct your personal information, we will provide you with reasons.

### Complaints

If you believe that we have not abided by the Australian Privacy Principles or this Privacy Policy, you may lodge a complaint in writing at diana@beautyheaven.com,au briefly outlining the facts and circumstances giving rise to the complaint, what action you would like us to take to resolve your complaint and how we may contact you to discuss the matter or obtain further information.

We may:

1\. agree to take the action you propose;

2\. try to discuss the matter with you or ask you to provide further information for us to consider your complaint;

3\. suggest an alternative action in response to your complaint, giving reasons; or

4\. if we feel we cannot address them in the manner you propose, give reasons why.

We will acknowledge receipt of your complaint within 10 business days and will endeavour to reach a resolution within 30 days of receiving your complaint, subject to any additional time required to consider further information or other relevant materials. If we think that more than 30 days is required, we advise you of the estimated additional. 

### Anonymity or Pseudonymity

Wherever it is lawful and practicable, we will give you the option of not identifying yourself, or, using a pseudonym, when entering interacting with the Site.

### When we disclose personal information overseas

We may disclose personal information from time to time about you to organisations in a foreign country that advertise products and services on our website.

We will not disclose personal information to an organisation in a foreign country, unless we are satisfied that we believe that the organisation in the foreign country is subject to a law, binding scheme or a contract which requires that personal information disclosed to overseas organisations is subject to obligations that are substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles as contained in the Privacy Act, or, if not subject to such obligations you have granted consent to us disclosing this information that organisation.
