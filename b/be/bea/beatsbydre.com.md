# Beats by Dr. Dre - Privacy Policy

Welcome to BeatsByDre.com. This Privacy Policy is provided to inform you of our policies and practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about you.

* ## OUR PRIVACY COMMITMENT

Beats ("Beats," "we," "us" or "our") is committed to respecting the privacy rights and concerns of all users of the Beats website where this Privacy Policy is posted (the "Site") (we refer to the Site and the services made available through the Site, collectively, as the "Beats Features"). As such, we have established and implemented this Privacy Policy to inform visitors to the Site and users of the Beats Features how we use and protect the information we collect through the Site and the Beats Features. By visiting the Site or using any of the Beats Features, you consent to Beats' collection, use, storage, deletion and disclosure of information relating to you as set forth in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy is effective as of the date set forth above and is only applicable to the Site and not to any other website that you may be able to access from the Site which may have its own data collection and use practices and policies.

This policy answers the following questions:

  * What information do we collect about you and how do we use it?
  * Will we share your personal information with third parties?
  * What choices do you have about the collection and use of your personal information?
  * What security measures do we take to safeguard your personal information?


* ## WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT ABOUT YOU AND HOW DO WE USE IT?

**Types of Information We Collect**

Personal information means information that can be used to identify and contact you. You need to submit personal information to access certain aspects of the Site and the Beats Features. 

We collect personal information when you subscribe to our newsletter; participate in feedback forms, questionnaires, contests or sweepstakes; purchase a product through the Beats Features; or receive customer or technical support.

We collect information from you such as your name, address, email address, telephone number and date of birth when utilizing the Site and Beats Features. When registering products through the Site we also collect information about your products and where you purchased your products. When you are purchasing products through the Beats Features, you will also be required to provide a billing address and credit card or other payment information. No information of this type will be collected unless you have decided to purchase one of Beats' products.

**How We Use Your Personal Information**

The personal information you provide to us will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle your customer service questions or issues; administer promotions, contests and sweepstakes; register your products; and notify you of promotions, updates, or special offers that we think may interest you. We also use your email address and phone number as part of the Beats Features in sending you messages about the Beats Features and other general announcements. 

We keep track of your interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Beats Features. We may use personal information that you provide to us to send messages to you in response to your request to perform an activity in connection with your use of any of the Beats Features. We may also use your personal information to contact you when necessary.

We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user of the Beats Features. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This process is known as de-personalizing your information. 

You grant us a royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in providing the Beats Features (the " ** _Analytical Data_** "). We are expressly authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without limitation, sharing the Analytical Data with third parties, provided that we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally identifies any Beats Features users.

**Cookies**

"Cookies" are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a visitor's browser and are stored on the visitor's hard drive. Like many websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience of the Beats Features by, for instance, tailoring content to you. Cookies also prevent items placed in a shopping basket from disappearing by the time you checkout.

**Log Information**

Our servers automatically record information that your browser sends whenever you visit the Site. This information includes your Internet Protocol address, your browser type and version, the search engine you used to find the Beats Features, if any, which Beats Features you use and when and how long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the Beats Features, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Beats Features.

**Children's Privacy**

We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. We take children's privacy seriously, and encourage parents to play an active role in their children's online experience at all times.

* ## WILL WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES?

Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you through email and/or a prominent notice on the Site.
  * Service Providers. We may share your personal information with service providers that we engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf. For example, we may partner with other companies to process payments for the Beats Features. Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, and/or store data, including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for us, these companies may access your personal information. To the extent applicable, we require these entities to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
