# Privacy Policy

At Beamdog, we respect the privacy of our online visitors and the users of our Beamdog Player product. We realize how important it is to keep your information safe and we go to lengths to protect your information. This policy guides how we work with your information to create a better experience for the users on our site and in our player.

As part of our efforts to make our services better we collect two major kinds of information which are described below:

"Aggregate Information" is non-individually oriented data, such as usage habits, patterns or demographic data which does not reveal the identity of the user.

"Individual Information" is data which identifies you as an individual and is used to identify your and your account in the store and player. As part of using our service, we require you create a Beamdog account. As part of the account creation we will collect some personal information, including your name, e-mail address and display name. We store this information securely on our servers to provide the Beamdog service. We also collect additional information at the time of purchase to pass along to our payment provider. This information is not stored on our servers.

Beamdog may use the contact information provided to send information about Beamdog, such as product updates, news and promotional information, but only if the user agrees to such communication. We will not share your individual information with any third parties unless required to satisfy a court order or protect our property. Beamdog may allow third party contractors or service providers access to the data if it is required in the performance of services by those groups. In that instance, the third party will be bound by the terms of this privacy policy. Additionally, the access provided to the third party will be limited to the minimum extent required to provide the requested service.

As a service provider, we have links to and from our online sites to various third party sites. Our privacy policy does not extend to these sites and companies. Please refer directly to the third party website regarding their privacy policy.

Beamdog will never knowingly collect personal information for any person 12 years of age or under. We encourage parents to participate in the online activity of their children and ensure they do not give out personal information when online.

Beamdog has put in place appropriate physical, electronic and managerial processes to secure and safeguard the information we collect. We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption on all pages of the website where personal data is entered or transmitted. We do not store credit card information on our servers.

As part of our online store we make use of cookies in a number of means, such as to store cart contents when you exit the store and return later. Some of the features of the Beamdog website require cookies and if disabled, some features may not function properly.

At Beamdog we will continue to add features and functionality to our offerings. We may make forums or other user-content driven services available through our service. Any information disclosed in these areas is public information. You should exercise caution before disclosing any personally identifiable information through these means. Any user-driven content does not reflect the views of Beamdog or any of its affiliates.

By using our website or service you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy and our Conditions of Use. Please review the conditions of use using the link at the bottom of the page. If you fail to agree with both policies you are not authorized to use the website or the Beamdog Player.

We reserve the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy, provided we give you notice of such changes. Your continued use of the Beamdog Player or Website will signify your acceptance of these changes.

Thanks to our handy dandy privacy policy, you can use Beamdog without worry! Well, the privacy policy and the fact that I'm quite adept at bashing heads with my shield. Nobody is getting at your precious, precious bits!
