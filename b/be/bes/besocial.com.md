**Collection of Information**

**In General**  
We may collect personal information that can identify you, such as your name and e-mail address, and other information that does not identify you. BeSocial.com is the sole owner of the information collected on its Website. We will not sell, share or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this policy.

This information may include your name, address, e-mail address, telephone number, financial information such as your payment method (valid credit card number, type, expiration date or other financial information), and information you provide about other people such as the name and address of a gift recipient. We also may request information about your interests and activities, your gender and age, and other demographic information as well as public information such as user ratings and reviews, saved restaurant and event listings, and other information you view on the Website.

**Information Collected Automatically**  
We automatically collect information from your browser when you visit our Website, which helps us track users' movements around the Site and understand trends. This information includes your IP address, your browser type and language, the date and time of your visit, the content of any undeleted “cookies” that your browser previously accepted from us (see “Cookies” below), and the referring website address.

**Cookies**  
When you visit our Website, we may assign your computer one or more “cookies” to facilitate access to our Site and to personalize your online experience. Cookies may also be used to help save you time by remembering the information that you have already provided to us. We do not use cookies to retrieve information from your computer that was not voluntarily provided by you. The use of cookies is an industry standard and most browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser settings to decline cookies. If you choose to delete or decline cookies, some of the interactive features and services of our Website may not function properly.

**Web Beacons**  
We may use standard Internet tools, such as “web beacons” and other similar technologies, to track your use of our Site. Web beacons (also known as clear gifs, pixel tags or web bugs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of web users or to access cookies. Web beacons may be used to deliver or communicate with cookies, to count users who have visited certain pages and to understand usage patterns. We also may include web beacons in promotional or other e-mail messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the services we offer our Site visitors, to monitor how visitors are navigating and/or interacting with our Site, to track transactions processed through our Site, and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming or other activities. We also may receive an anonymous identification number if you come to our Site from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party website.

**Job Applicants**  
If your personal information is submitted through our Website when applying for a position with our company, the information will be used solely in connection with considering and acting upon your application. We may retain your personal information for a period of time, but only for the purpose of considering your application for current or future available positions.

 **Disclosure of Information**  
**  
In General**  
We will not share your personal information with others except as indicated below, or except when we inform you in advance and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your personal information shared.

**Authorized Service Providers**  
We may share your personal information with our authorized service providers that perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business and sales analysis, supporting our Website functionality, and supporting contests, sweepstakes, surveys and other features offered through our Website. In order to perform their jobs, these service providers may have limited access to some of the information we maintain about you. We require all such service providers to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information, limit their access to any personal information to the minimum necessary to perform their obligations, and not to use the information they may access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us or on our behalf. We are not responsible for any additional information you provide to these parties, and we encourage you to become familiar with their privacy practices before disclosing information directly to them.

**Business Partners:**  
When you make purchases or engage in promotions offered through our Website or our services, we may share personal information with the businesses with which we partner to offer you those products, services, promotions, contests and/or sweepstakes. When you elect to engage in a particular merchant's offer or program, you authorize us to provide your e-mail address and other information to that merchant.

**Other Situations**  
We also may disclose your information:

    •    In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us.

    •    When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our website terms and conditions or other agreements or policies.

    •    In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. The personal information, which you provide to us, is an asset of the company and may be included in the assets transferred in the event of a substantial corporate transaction.

We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. However, aggregated information is not linked to any personal information that can identify any individual or company. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our Website and the most popular features or services accessed. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop Website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising. For merchants, we may share your business contact information with third parties, including but not limited to, business name, address, telephone number, e-mail address and name of owner or proprietor of the business.

**Updating Your Information**

**How You Can Access and Update Your Information**  
You may access, update or correct your personal information at any time by going to “My Account Information” in the “My Account” section of our Site. You can also review and update your personal information by contacting us. More information about how to contact us is provided below.

**Your Choices**

    •    You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of our Website because such information may be required in order for you to register as a member or user; purchase products or services; participate in a contest, promotion, survey, or sweepstakes; ask a question; or initiate other transactions on our Website.

    •    At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional e-mails or newsletters from us by signing in with your account information, clicking on the "My Account" link, then clicking on the "My Account Information" link and selecting those portions of your communication settings you would like to update. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial e-mail that we send to you, to opt-out of receiving such messages in the future. It may take up to 10 days for us to process an opt-out request. We may send you other types of transactional and relationship e-mail communications, such as order confirmations/receipts, service announcements, administrative notices, and surveys, without offering you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving them.

 **Security** **In General**  
BeSocial.com is committed to taking reasonable steps to ensure the security of your information. In an effort to prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the appropriate use of information while it is under our control, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online via the Site. Your credit card security is our highest priority. BeSocial.com utilizes Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption, an advanced encryption technology that protects the information you send us against unauthorized access.

When you register for an account on our Website, we ask you to create a password. To protect the confidentiality of your personal information, you must keep your password confidential and not disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for all uses of our Site by any person using your password.

We want you to feel confident using our Website to transact business. However, no system can be completely secure. Therefore, although we take steps to secure your information, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Users should also take care with how they handle and disclose their personal information and should avoid sending personal information through insecure e-mail. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission's website at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/menus/consumer/data.shtm for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.

**Children**  
We encourage parents to take an active interest in their children's use of the Internet. BeSocial.com has no intention of collecting, and will not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. Should we ever do so, we will comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. If you are under 13, you should not provide information on our Website and should ask your parent to do so for you.

**Links to Third-Party Websites**  
This Website may contain links to other websites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites, as this Privacy Policy applies solely to BeSocial.com. We encourage our users to remain vigilant when they leave our Website and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
