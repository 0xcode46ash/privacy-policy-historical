#### Information Sharing 

BestCollegesOnline.com will only share users’ personal information in ways that are consistent with this privacy policy. Under no circumstance will BestCollegesOnline.com sell your information to other companies with inappropriate marketing intentions. Meanwhile, there are some cases in which we will share your personal information. One of those cases is if we hire a third party service company to assist us in our business undertakings and it needs users’ personal information to complete its duties. In such a case, a service company contracted by us will use this information only for BestCollegesOnline.com’s business purposes, not its own.

Another instance is when we have your permission and are legally ordered to do so if we’re engaged in merging, acquiring, or selling some or all of our business assets. In this case, if we feel with good reason (i.e. in good faith) that doing so will meet a government demand, aid us in investigating fraud, or necessarily safeguard yours, another’s, or our physical safety or rights, we may give a third party your personal information.
