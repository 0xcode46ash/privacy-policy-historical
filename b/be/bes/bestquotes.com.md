###  **1\. What information do we collect?**

We collect several different types of information from you:

 **A. Information collected at registration**

We collect personal information when you register with us and when you use our Services. We may combine this information about you with information we obtain from our business partners or other companies. During registration for some of our services, we may require users to give us basic contact information (such as your first and last name, e-mail addresses, and mobile phone number). The information requested on the registration form may change from time to time. Although additional demographic information may be requested at the time of registration, only information marked “required” is necessary for registration and utilization of our services.

We do not accept registrations from persons under the age of eighteen. If you are between the ages of 16-18 you must have your parent’s approval to register. If we learn that a user is under the age of eighteen without valid parental approval, we will terminate the account and delete the user’s information. We will not be liable for any content or advertisements viewed by minor children in violation of the terms of this policy.

In compliance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the Site is not directed at or designed to attract children. Accordingly, we do not knowingly or intentionally collect personally identifiable information from anyone under 13 years of age.

 **B. Information collected through use of the Site and Services**

In addition to the specific questions you answer when you register for our Services, we may also collect information from winners of our contests, such as their street address, phone number, and date of birth so that we can comply with various state and federal reporting requirements.

We collect system information such as IP addresses (in other words, the location of your computer on the Internet) for system administration, troubleshooting, security, and to examine overall traffic trends. This information, in aggregate form, is recorded for administrative purposes.

We also may use cookies, a small data file stored on your computer, to customize portions of our Services and Site to your preferences. For example, we may use this cookie to identify you as a registered user of our Services. If you do not allow your browser to accept cookies, please understand that some of the areas or functionality within our Site may be limited.

If you opt in to this Privacy Policy, Provider may share, sell, or license cookies collected from you browser and hard drive to third-party advertisers. These authorized third parties may link your name, address, and e-mail address to other information which they collect, such as past online/offline purchase information and Web usage from other sites. These authorized companies are contractually bound to secure the data they receive. To learn more about this practice click here: http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp. You may disable cookies by adjusting the settings on your web browser.

The use of cookies by our partners is covered by our privacy policy. We do not have always access or control over these cookies. Our partners use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, in order for you to use the shopping cart, etc.

Our Web pages contain electronic images known as Web beacons (sometimes called single-pixel gifs) and are used along with cookies to compile aggregated statistics to analyze how our site is used. We may also use Web Beacons in some of our emails to let us know which emails and links have been opened by recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of our customer communications and marketing campaigns.

Our Web site includes social media plug-ins and features (“Social Media Features”), such as the Facebook “Like” button and Widgets, such as the “Share This” button or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Social Media Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Social Media Features to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing such features.

###  **2\. What do we do with the information we collect?**

Without limiting the foregoing, by providing your personal information on the Site, you agree that such act constitutes an inquiry and/or application for purposes of the Amended Telemarketing Sales Rule (16 CFR §310 et seq.), as amended from time to time (the “Rule”) and applicable state do-not-call regulations. As such, notwithstanding that your telephone number may be listed on the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call List, and/or on applicable state do-not-call lists, we retain the right to contact you via telemarketing, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice dialing, in accordance with the Rule and the applicable state do-not-call regulations.

Your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Site constitutes your express written consent to receive telemarketing calls from third-party marketers, including by means of a pre-recorded message and automated voice dialing. Your consent will be effective regardless of whether the number you have provided: (a) is a home, business, or cell phone line; or (b) is or will be registered on any state or federal Do-Not-Call (DNC) list, and such consent shall remain in effect until you revoke your consent by contacting us, as described in Section 5 (“OPT OUT”).

You further consent to receive autodialed and/or pre-recorded telemarketing calls from or on behalf of Provider and Provider’s third-party marketing partners at the telephone number you provide to us, including your wireless number, if applicable. You understand that consent is not a condition of purchase.

  * provide the Services to you,

  * confirm your agreement with us for use of the Services,

  * improve our Services,

  * award contest prizes,

  * customize certain pages or Services for you, and

###  **3\. With whom do we share information?**

  * We may disclose such information to third party vendors (e.g., data storage and processing facilities) that we use to assist us in providing our services, subject to similar obligations of confidentiality to those contained in this Privacy Policy.

  * We may disclose the name of winners of our contests as may be required by law on our Site and in winner’s lists.

  * We may disclose your personal information upon a transfer or sale to another entity of all or substantially all of our stock or assets in the line of business that this privacy policy relates or upon any other corporate reorganization. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you may have regarding your personal information.

  * With your permission, we will provide your personal information to other companies so that they can market their products or services to you.




With your permission, we may also share aggregate demographic and other information regarding use of our Services with third parties for marketing and other purposes.

###  **4\. Access to your account**

Please note that users cannot update or delete previously submitted information. If your information (such as your email address) should change, we ask that you re-submit a registration form or request.

###  **5\. OPT OUT**

By submitting your information to us, you are consenting to receive marketing communications from Provider and its third party marketing partners. If, after you have shared your information with us, you decide that you do not want to receive marketing communications from Provider, you can discontinue the communications by sending an email to [**privacy@bestquotes.com**](mailto:privacy@bestquotes.com "Contact Us") with the phrase “opt out” (or similar language) in the subject heading, or by calling **1-888-bestquotes** (888-237-8786). You may also send opt-out requests to the following address:

If you have registered or submitted information under more than one email account, you must submit separate opt-out requests for each account.

We may provide information to third parties, and third parties may independently collect information about users. Information shared with, or collected by, these third parties is subject to those third parties’ policies governing use and disclosure of personal information. Users should contact those third parties directly if they do not wish to receive communications from them, do not want those third parties to collect information about them, or wish to take any other actions with regard to such information.

###  **6\. Data Retention**

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you the Services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

###  **7\. Other websites**

Our Site may contain links to other websites. We cannot be responsible for their content or for personal information you may choose to share with them. Please note: any information you release directly to parties who provide services to us, such as any vendors who advertise on our Site or Services, may be subject to different rules of use or disclosure. We encourage you to investigate the privacy policies and practices of any third parties prior to disclosing personal information to them.

###  **8\. Security**

Your privacy is important to us and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect the security of the personal information we collect. Because this site does not encrypt incoming e-mail, you should not send information that you consider highly sensitive through this Web site. We use commercially reasonable security measures to ensure that your personally identifiable information is not lost, misused, altered, or unintentionally destroyed. We also use software programs that monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information, or otherwise cause damage. Except for authorized law enforcement investigations, no attempts are made to identify individual users or their usage habits. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

When you enter sensitive information on our site, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).

###  **9\. Disclaimer Notice**

The Provider makes no claims, promises or guarantees about the accuracy, currency, completeness, or adequacy of the contents of this Web site and expressly disclaims liability for errors and omissions in its contents. No warranty of any kind, implied, express or statutory, including but not limited to the warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given with respect to this Web site, the Services or its links to other Internet resources.

###  **10\. Endorsement Disclaimer**

When visiting our Site, your Web browser may produce pop-up advertisements. These advertisements are typically produced by other Web sites you visited or by third-party software installed on your computer. The Provider does not endorse or recommend products or services you may view when you receive a pop-up advertisement on your computer screen while visiting our site.

Reference in the Site to any specific commercial products, processes, or services, or the use of any trade, firm, or corporation name is for the information and convenience of the public, and does not constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the Provider.

###  **11\. Notice of changes**

We may update this privacy policy to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any change in how we use your personal information we will notify you by email (sent to the e-mail address specified in your account) or by means of a notice on this Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review this page for the latest information on our privacy practices.
