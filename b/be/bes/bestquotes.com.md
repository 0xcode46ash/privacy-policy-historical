**_[](https://web.archive.org/web/20091223174435id_/http%3A//www.bestquotes.com/contact.htm)PRIVACY POLICY_**

Best Quotes Corporation ("Best Quotes") is committed to protecting the privacy of personal information collected from visitors to our web site.

**Our Security Measures**  
Best Quotes uses appropriate technologies to ensure the security of information transmitted via our web site and maintained in our possession.

**Your Personal Information**  
Best Quotes does not collect personally identifiable information on our website, such as your name, address, e-mail address or telephone number, without your knowledge. Such information is collected only when you knowingly and voluntarily submit it to us (as, for example, when you contact us via e-mail). Best Quotes uses such voluntarily submitted information for the purposes for which it was submitted.

The personal information you submit when filling out our online mortgage application is treated as confidential by Best Quotes. We use this information to process your transaction, and we share the information with trusted parties necessary to qualify, process, close and service your mortgage.

When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as receiving daily rates via email, Best Quotes may ask you to provide certain information about yourself, such as your name, mailing address, or e-mail address, by filling out and submitting an online form. Best Quotes does not sell or share this information with third parties. This information is collected in order to support your participation in the activities you select.

Best Quotes may also use information provided by you to give you information and special offers on other services that we may provide that we think would be useful to your needs. However, at any time, you may choose to not receive such information or offers from Best Quotes simply by contacting us at the email address listed below.

At any time, you may also access and correct personal information that you have submitted to Best Quotes by contacting us at the email address listed below.

**Non-Personal Information**  
Best Quotes collects non-personal user information (for example, IP addresses) in aggregate form. An IP address is a number given to you by a web server. Examples of information provided by an IP address include service provider, type of browser and type of system used. An IP address is not used to obtain personal information about a user. Best Quotes may use non-personal user information to make its site better and more responsive to your needs. This non-personal information is also shared with third parties for marketing, advertising or research purposes.

Best Quotes does not utilize cookies, although our online mortgage application suite may require that your browser be enabled to accept cookies in order for the browser to access our technology. (Cookies are small bits of information that are placed on your hard drive when you visit a web site, making it possible to track your activity on the site. Cookies are used by most major sites on the Internet. Most major browsers can be adjusted not to accept cookies.)
