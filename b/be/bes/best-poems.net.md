Such Personally Identifiable Information may include your name, address, email address and telephone number.  
You do not have to provide us with any Personally Identifiable Information to visit our Website. However, if you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to publish texts online. 

**WHERE AND WHEN INFORMATION IS COLLECTED ON OUR WEBSITE**  
We may collect Personally Identifiable Information from you in different manners and at different places on our Website, such as when you register to the Best Poems Newsletter, or create New Account in our Website. In all of these cases, we will collect Personally Identifiable Information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. 

**USE OF INFORMATION THAT WE COLLECT**  
In general, we use the information collected on our Website to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website. On occasion, we may send you information on new offerings or upcoming events. However, if you do not wish to receive E-mailed marketing messages from us, please let us know by sending an E-mail to [postmaster@best-poems.net](mailto:postmaster@best-poems.net) or writing us using the contact form in our Contact Page. 

**WHEN WE DISCLOSE INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES**  
Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, we will not disclose any information we gather from you on our Website.  
We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information if we believe in good faith that we are required by law to do so. We may disclose Personally Identifiable Information in special circumstances when we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to protect the safety and/or security of our users, our Website, or the general public.

**DOES THIS PRIVACY POLICY APPLY WHEN I LINK TO OTHER WEBSITES?**  
Our Website contains links to other websites not owned or operated by the Best Poems Encyclopedia. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy, privacy practices and performance of those websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to the information collected by our Website. 

**IS THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT SECURE?**  
We want your information, including your Personally Identifiable Information, to remain as secure as possible. We strive to secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. 

**3\. General Information**

**UPDATING AND CORRECTING MY PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION.**  
You can always contact us in order to (1) update or correct your Personally Identifiable Information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you may receive from us, or (3) delete the Personally Identifiable Information maintained about you on our systems, by contacting our Postmaster at the address set out below. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third-parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. 

You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us on our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your Personally Identifiable Information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all Personally Identifiable Information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted as appropriate, as soon as reasonably practicable.

If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by posting changes on our Website in this Privacy Policy, or by email or otherwise, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your Personally Identifiable Information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your Personally Identifiable Information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Website.
