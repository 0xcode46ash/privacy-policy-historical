**Best Friends Privacy Policy**

**General Statement**  
Best Friends Animal Society has established security policies to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information collected online. The following is an explanation of our policies regarding the collection and use of personal information from our online visitors. 

This privacy statement applies to information collected on our website only. There are several places on our site where we link to other websites or to services hosted by other websites. Please be advised that the privacy policies on other sites may not be consistent with our own privacy policy. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of a website before engaging in transactions with that site. The sections of our site that link to other sites include forums/bulletin boards, the Pet Club store, Best Friends Visa credit card application, and the Telecare program. 

**Information Collection**  
In several areas of this site we collect personally identifiable information. “Personally identifiable” refers to information that could be used to contact a person, such as full name, home address, email address, and telephone number. Any personally identifiable information collected online by Best Friends is provided entirely on a voluntary basis by our visitors, in areas involving voluntary transactions such as making a donation online, joining a forum or bulletin board, signing up to become a member of the Best Friends Network, and subscribing to the Best Friends magazine. Personally identifiable information collected online is used by Best Friends solely for internal purposes. For more information on the collection and use of personally identifiable information, please see “Security” and “Cookies” below.

**Use of Information**  
We do not sell, rent, or exchange personal information collected online on our website with other companies. We may use email addresses collected on our website to circulate news about Best Friends Animal Society and its programs, to promote events, and to acquire new members and subscribers. We may share aggregated demographic information with our funders for the purpose of demonstrating that we are meeting our organizational goals. A visitor who receives email from us may opt out of email at any time by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email, or by sending an email to [info@bestfriends.org](mailto:info@bestfriends.org). 

**Children**  
Best Friends operates a general audience website. We have a section for humane education (called “Schoolhouse”) that provides material of interest to students and teachers. If we receive personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13, we may use it to seek consent from a parent or teacher in order to fulfill information requests. (We follow the [COPPA guidelines ](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/coppa.htm)established by the FTC.) Purchases in our online store may be made by valid credit card holders only. Our forums/bulletin boards are intended for adults.

**Security**  
Best Friends uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to protect and encrypt online donation and order information while it is being transferred across the Internet. SSL is an industry standard security technology. To further enhance security, stored donation and order information is also encrypted to prevent unauthorized access to the data. 

**Cookies**  
Cookies are used on the Best Friends website for the convenience of our site visitors and members. We don't collect personal information via cookies. We do use "per-session" cookies in the Best Friends Pet Club section of the site. Visitors with "per-session" cookies disabled cannot shop at the online store or post to the bulletin boards/forums.
