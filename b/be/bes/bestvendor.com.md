# Privacy - BestVendor.com

**General Statement**

BestVendor, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company”), maintains this site (“Site”), among other reasons, to help people at startups and small businesses make faster, smarter purchasing decisions through social recommendations (collectively, the “Services”), subject to the Terms and Conditions of Use [HYPERLINK TO THE TERMS] (the “Terms”) and this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”).

This Privacy Policy only applies to this Site and describes the information we collect, how we use it, with whom we share it, and other matters related to such information. **By accessing and using this Site, including by providing information to us, you signify your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you here, by means of a notice on our home page so that you may access and review the changes to this document in advance of your continued use of the Services. If you object to any changes, you may close your account. You will signify your agreement with the new policy by continuing to use this Site after the changes have been posted.**

The Company controls, owns, and manages the information collected on the Site and may use the information solely for its own purposes.

If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, contact our privacy team at: privacy@bestvendor.com.

**The Information We Collect**

1\. **_Information You Provide_.**

(a) When you sign up at the Site for the Services you provide us with access to your profile information from LinkedIn or other social networking site(s) to which you provide us with access. You may choose to supplement this information with additional profile information and product and service usage information after your initial registration. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. We may also supplement the information you provide with information we receive from third parties.

(b) When you send email or other communications to us for customer service or other reasons, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Services.

**2. _Transactional Information_. We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the Site. If you do not want us to store your payment source account information, please contact our privacy team to have it removed.**

3\. **_Cookie Information_.** We use “cookies” (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make the Site easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and the Company. For example, we use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Site. We also use cookies to confirm that you are logged into the Site, and to know when you are interacting with the Site and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies by using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Site.

4\. _Clear GIFS_. We also employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”) that helps us better manage content on the Site by providing us feedback as to what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on a website page, web-based document or email message and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to confirm receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to other recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the “Opt-out” section below.

5\. _Site Information_. Due to communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our Site. Additionally, advertisers receive the URL of the page you were on when you click on an ad on our Site. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device and mobile operating system, as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled.

6\. _Site Analytics_. We analyze your use of the Site with third party software that allows us to monitor and record your navigation of the Site, in order to better customize our offerings and improve our products. 

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:

1\. **_To Manage the Services._ ** We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support.

3\. _Email Communications_. If you do not want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process or by opting out as described below.

7\. _Association with Personally Identifiable Information_. We may associateyour online navigational information and transactional information gathered by cookies and clear gifs to your personally identifiable information. We associate this information only for our purposes, to deliver services and products to you, to improve our business and to market our products and services through email, mobile advertising, direct mail and other media. The association of navigational information, cookies, clear gifs and personally identifiable information results in a more personalized experience on the Site that is tailored to your interests.

**How the Information We Collect May Be Shared**

1\. _Promotional Partners_. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy. We will also not share other personal information not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other Services without your explicit consent or to carry out your instructions unless disclosure is reasonably necessary in our opinion to (i) comply with legal process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (ii) enforce this policy; (iii) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties, whether or not the third party is a Site user, individual, or governmental agency; (iv) respond to customer service inquiries; or (v) protect the rights, property, or personal safety of the Company, Site and Services users or the public.

2\. _Public Profile_. The Site may offer a “public profile” feature that allows users to publish portions of their profile to the public internet. This public profile will be crawled by and displayed through search engines when someone searches for your name. When this feature is available, you will be able to opt-out of it by editing your account settings; however, we do not warrant how often third-party search engines will update their caches, which may contain old public profile information.

3\. _Testimonials and Advertisements_. If you provide any testimonials about the products or services advertised on the Site, we may post those testimonials and examples of advertisements you place in connection with our promotion of these services to third parties. Testimonials and advertisements may include your name and other personal information that you have provided.

In order to deliver relevant and valuable ads to you and your network, we may use your name and profile photo in connection with social advertising based on content shared on the Site. This advertising may include the fact that you have recommended or endorsed a product or service on the Site, followed a company, established or added content to your profile, etc., and will only be displayed to other users of the Site. You can opt out of allowing your name and/or profile photo being used in social ads by contacting our privacy team.

5\. _Outside Contractors_. We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers to support our services and products and the Site, such as hosting, monitoring and maintaining the Site, administering or monitoring emails, analyzing our visitors’ preferences, developing applications for the Site and providing general consulting services. These outside contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected from you, including your personally identifiable information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your personally identifiable information by these outside contractors is limited to the information we determine, in our sole discretion, to be reasonably necessary in order for them to perform their function for us. While we will seek to require outside contractors to protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information under a policy at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of outside contractors.

6\. _Business Transfers_. We may also disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties in connection with a corporate transaction, such as a merger, acquisition by another company or sale or other transfer of all or a portion of our business or assets (including our associated customer lists containing your personal information).

7\. _Non-Private or Non-Personal Information_. We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information about the usage of the Site or the Services to third parties for purposes that we deem, in our sole discretion, to be appropriate, including to prospective advertisers on the Site.

**Links and Advertising**

From time to time, the Site may contain hyperlinks (“Links”) to third party websites as well as banner advertising and sponsorships operated by or referring to third parties and their goods and services (“Advertising”). Such Links and Advertising are for your reference only, and we neither control the privacy policies of such linked or advertised websites nor are we liable or responsible in any way for the use of any personally identifiable information that you may provide such sites. We recommend that you remain aware when you leave the Site and review the terms of use and privacy policies of each and every linked website.

You should also be aware that if you voluntarily disclose personally identifiable information in an email or other communications with any third party listed on the Site or in other materials, that information, along with any other information disclosed in your communication, can be collected and correlated and used by such third parties and may result in your receiving unsolicited messages from other persons. Such collection, correlation, use and messages are beyond our control.

**Security**

1\. **_Steps we take to keep your information secure_.**The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us. We have put in place commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to adequately safeguard and secure the information we collect on the Site from unauthorized access.

2\. **_Risks inherent in sharing information_.** Notwithstanding our commitment to protect your information, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet. Additionally, there also is some risk our security systems could be circumvented or breached. As a result, while we strive to use commercially reasonable means to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. If you have any questions regarding the security on the Site or of the Services you can contact our privacy team at the address and email set forth above.

**How You Can Change or Remove Information**

1\. **_Editing your information_. **You are responsible for providing accurate information when registering with any portion of the Site that requires registration, or performing other functions that might require you to submit personally identifiable information to the Site. If you wish to correct any personally identifiable information you have provided to us, you may do so by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above.

2\. **_Deactivating or deleting your account_. ** If you want to stop using your account you may deactivate it or delete it. The account can only be deleted by providing notice to us by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above. When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted. We save your profile information in case you later decide to reactivate your account. Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to the Site. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from the Site. You should only delete your account if you are certain you never want to reactivate it.

3\. **_Backup copies_.** Removed and deleted information may persist in backup copies, but will not be available to others.

**Opt-out**

As noted above, you may at any time opt-out of receiving promotional communications from us and/or request that we discontinue providing your basic contact information to third parties by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above. Please note that if you decide to opt-out of receiving promotional information or request that we discontinue providing your basic contact information, your change in preference will only affect future contacts; if the information already has been provided to third parties, they may continue to use it.

Even if you choose to opt-out, we reserve the right to contact you as necessary in our sole discretion regarding any request you have made for our services or products and changes to this Privacy Policy and also to use, transfer, sell and share aggregated, anonymous data about our users as a group for any business purpose, such as analyzing the Site’s usage trends and seeking compatible advertisers and partners.

**Children’s Policy**

**The Site is for general audiences and is not directed toward those under 13 years of age.**

**Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States**

**By using the Site, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States.**
