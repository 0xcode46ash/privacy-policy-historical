The Company controls, owns, and manages the information collected on the Site and may use the information solely for its own purposes. Except as stated elsewhere, all amendments to our Privacy Policy shall automatically be effective as soon as they are initially posted, except if we write in any future version of the Privacy Policy that we are giving advance notice of any amended term to be effective on a date in the future. Because we reserve these rights, you agree that you will visit this page periodically to review the Privacy Policy.

For purposes of this provision, a "writing" does not include an email message, text, chat, or the like, sent from any device existing now or later developed and a signature does not include an electronic signature. 

When You visit the Site or send Us e-mails, You are communicating with Us electronically. You consent to receive communications from Us electronically. We may communicate with You by e-mail or by posting notices on the Site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures, and other communications that We provide to You electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.

**The Information We Collect**

1\. **_Information You Provide_.**

(a) When you sign up at the Site for the Services you provide us with access to your profile information from LinkedIn or other social networking site(s) to which you provide us with access. You may choose to supplement this information with additional profile information and product and service usage information after your initial registration. In some cases we may ask for additional information for security reasons or to provide specific services to you. We may also supplement the information you provide with information we receive from third parties.

(b) When you send email or other communications to us for customer service or other reasons, we may retain those communications in order to process your inquiries, respond to your requests and improve the Services. 

**2. _Transactional Information_. We may retain the details of transactions or payments you make on the Site. If you do not want us to store your payment source account information, please contact our privacy team to have it removed.**

3\. **_Cookie Information_.** We use “cookies” (small pieces of data we store for an extended period of time on your computer, mobile phone, or other device) to make the Site easier to use, to make our advertising better, and to protect both you and the Company. For example, we use cookies to store your login ID (but never your password) to make it easier for you to login whenever you come back to the Site. We also use cookies to confirm that you are logged into the Site, and to know when you are interacting with the Site and our advertisements. You can remove or block cookies by using the settings in your browser, but in some cases that may impact your ability to use the Site.

4\. _Clear GIFS_. We also employ a software technology called “clear gifs” (also known as “web beacons” or “web bugs”) that helps us better manage content on the Site by providing us feedback as to what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on a website page, web-based document or email message and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to confirm receipt of, and response to, our emails, including those that you forward to other recipients. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see the “Opt-out” section below.

5\. _Site Information_. Due to communications standards on the internet, when you visit the Site we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our Site. Additionally, advertisers receive the URL of the page you were on when you click on an ad on our Site. We also receive the internet protocol (“IP”) address of your computer (or the proxy server you use to access the World Wide Web), your computer operating system and type of web browser you are using, email patterns, your mobile device and mobile operating system, as well as the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have enabled.

6\. _Site Analytics_. We analyze your use of the Site with third party software that allows us to monitor and record your navigation of the Site, in order to better customize our offerings and improve our products. 

**How We Use the Information We Collect**

We use the information we collect to try to provide a safe, efficient, and customized experience. Here are some of the details on how we do that:

1\. **_To Manage the Services._ ** We use the information we collect to provide our services and features to you, to measure and improve those services and features, and to provide you with customer support. We use the information to enforce our Terms. We also use a variety of technological systems to detect and address anomalous activity.

3\. _Email Communications_. If you do not want to receive commercial email or other mail from us, please indicate your preference during the registration process or by opting out as described below.

4\. **_To Serve Advertisements_.** We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you.

5\. **_To Advertise Our Services_.** We may ask third party advertisers to display advertisements promoting our services. We may ask them to deliver those advertisements based upon the presence of a cookie, but in doing so we will not share any other information with the advertiser.

The association of navigational information, cookies, clear gifs and personally identifiable information results in a more personalized experience on the Site that is tailored to your interests.

**How the Information We Collect May Be Shared**

1\. _Promotional Partners_. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your personally identifiable information to third parties, except as described in this policy.

2\. _Public Profile_. The Site may offer a “public profile” feature that allows users to publish portions of their profile to the public internet.

We may employ independent contractors, vendors and suppliers to support our services and products and the Site, such as hosting, monitoring and maintaining the Site, administering or monitoring emails, analyzing our visitors’ preferences, developing applications for the Site and providing general consulting services. These outside contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected from you, including your personally identifiable information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your personally identifiable information by these outside contractors is limited to the information we determine, in our sole discretion, to be reasonably necessary in order for them to perform their function for us. While we will seek to require outside contractors to protect the privacy of your personally identifiable information under a policy at least as restrictive as this Privacy Policy and will not authorize them to use this information except for the express purpose for which it is provided, we do not bear any responsibility for any actions or policies of outside contractors.

**Consent to Collection and Processing in the United States**

By using the Site, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the United States. The information You enter on or through a BESTVENDOR Site or otherwise provide to BESTVENDOR may be transferred outside of the European Union to the United States of America, which does not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union. In particular, You are advised that the United States of America uses a sectoral model of privacy protection that relies on a mix of legislation, governmental regulation, and self-regulation. Article 26 of the European Union's Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC, 1995 O.J. (L 281) 31) allows for transfer of personal data from the European Union to a third country if the individual has unambiguously given his consent to the transfer of personal information, regardless of the third country's level of protection. By agreeing to the terms of use and this privacy policy, You consent to the transfer of all such information to the United States of America, which may not offer an equivalent level of protection to that required in the European Union and to the processing of that information by BESTVENDOR on its servers located in the United States of America as described in this Privacy Policy.

We regularly review our compliance with this Privacy Policy. Please let us know of any questions or concerns you have regarding this Privacy Policy by contacting our privacy team at the address and email set forth above. When we receive formal written complaints, it is our policy to contact that complaining user regarding his/her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between the Company and an individual.
