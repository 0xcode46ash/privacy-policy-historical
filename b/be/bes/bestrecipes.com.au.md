## Log Files

We collect and use visitor data contained in server log files. The information in these log files includes your IP address, your ISP, your web browser, the date and time you visited and the pages you accessed throughout our site.

## Cookies and Web Beacons

We use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. The main purpose of this is to retain your login information when returning rather than requiring you to login each time.

We also use third-party advertisements on Best Recipes to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP, your browser, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (e.g. showing ads for Sydney cooking schools to someone in Sydney) or showing certain ads based on other sites you have visited.

You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to easily login to your account.
