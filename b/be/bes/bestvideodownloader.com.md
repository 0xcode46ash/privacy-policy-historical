###  Yontoo Layers Information Collection and Transfer

To provide services to the User, Best Video Downloader requires Yontoo Layers software to be installed. Yontoo is a browser plugin platform that enables application developers to build browser applications such as Best Video Downloader.

When you install Yontoo Layers a set of non-personally identifiable values are stored on your computer and transferred back and stored on Yontoo’s servers. This set of data consists of a randomly generated value that identifies the Yontoo Plug-in associated with each of your Yontoo supported browsers, and a randomly generated value representing your computer. These non-personally identifiable values enable Yontoo to provide you with the services and Layer Apps that you have selected to enable.

Once you have installed Yontoo Layers, each time you load or refresh a page in one of the Yontoo supported browsers, a request will be made to a Yontoo owned server to determine whether or not you have enabled any Services for the domain you are currently browsing. To determine this, the request made by Yontoo Layers will collect and pass back the following non-personally identifiable information: The unique identifier representing the Yontoo Layers plug-in installed in your browser and the URL representing the domain and page you are currently browsing. This data is used for the sole purpose of determining whether or not you have enabled any Layer Apps for the given domain and page. This Web usage information is never stored on Yontoo’s servers.

If you utilize one of the Layer Apps that runs on the Facebook domain, Yontoo may also collect your Facebook username and user ID. This information will be stored in a cookie on your computer, and passed back as part of the aforementioned request. The sole purpose of this additional information is to provide you with a more personalized experience while utilizing Facebook related Layer Apps. This information will be stored on Yontoo’s servers and is correlated with the above-mentioned Yontoo plug-in identifier.

No information from children under age 13. If you are under age 13, please do not attempt to register for Yontoo Layers or provide any personal information about yourself to Yontoo. If Yontoo learns that they have collected personal information from a child under age 13, they will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that Yontoo might have any information from a child under age 13, please contact Yontoo through its support page (http://www.yontoo.com/Support.aspx).

Parental participation: Yontoo strongly recommends that minors ask their parents for permission before sending any information about themselves to anyone over the Internet and we encourage parents to teach their children about safe internet use practices. 

This information collection, transfer and storage as described in this section, is required for Yontoo Layers functionality. If you do not wish for any of this information to be collected or potentially shared as described in the following section (Yontoo Layers Information Sharing), you should not use the Yontoo Software or Services.

###  Yontoo Layers Information Sharing

Yontoo may collect and analyze your usage patterns such as which sites you visit, that are not personally identifiable. These non-personally identifiable data are used to improve Yontoo’s services, and may be shared with third parties.

Yontoo Layers may engage with third party analytics providers, such as Google Analytics, to provide Yontoo with data to improve its software and services. Any information, such as URL visited, that Yontoo provides to one of these third parties is not personally identifiable.

Yontoo reserves the right to track and use aggregate information about users of Yontoo Layers, such as operating system, browser type and locality, for a variety of purposes. Such aggregate information does not identify individual consumers. We may share such aggregate and related demographic information with third parties.

###  Yontoo Layers Privacy Policy
