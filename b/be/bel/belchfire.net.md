Privacy Policy  
Belchfire.net's Privacy Policy  


> **Your privacy is important.**
> 
>   * At Belchfire.net, we know that your privacy is important to you. It is important to us too. That is why we want you to know about the personal information we collect, how we use that information and with whom it may be shared. 
> 

> 
> **You are always in control.**
> 
>   * The only personal information that we collect is information that you give us when you register. We use that information to service your account and to personalize your experience at Belchfire.net. We'll never share that information with third parties interested in e-mailing you or send you our own promotional offer e-mails without your consent. To see (or change) your information, just visit the [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204210520id_/http%3A//belchfire.net/modules.php?name=Your_Account) page at Belchfire.net (you will need to do this for each account, if you have more than one). 
>

> 
>   * When you register at the site, we ask for certain basic information to service your account: your e-mail address and a Nickname. We assign you a password that you can change using the [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204210520id_/http%3A//belchfire.net/modules.php?name=Your_Account) page.

We only use this information to provide the requested service.  
>

>

> **What you should know about cookies:**
> 
>   * Cookies are small pieces of information that we send through your browser to your hard drive. Belchfire.net uses cookies to let us recognize you and provide a more meaningful and personalized experience when you logon to our site.

> 

> 
> **With whom is information shared?**
> 
>   * We may release specific personal information for the following reasons:  
> 
> 

>
>>   1. We use outside companies to provide you with some of the services you use on our site as well as for managing some of our internal operations such as databases, data analysis and e-mails. As a result, these companies do have access to the specific information necessary to provide you with your goods or services, but we require them to keep this information confidential and not to use it for any other reason.
>>   2. We will release your personal information to the proper persons when we believe, in good faith, that we are required to comply with a law or legal process, enforce our user agreements, or protect the rights, property or safety of Belchfire.net or other persons or entities.  
> 
>> 

> 
> **Aggregate Statistics.**
> 
>   * From time to time we provide aggregate statistics about our members, site traffic and other site-related information to reputable companies. "Aggregate" is the key word here. You can be assured that we never include information that allows these companies to identify you individually. 
> 

> 
> **E-Mail Addresses.**
> 
>   * We never rent or sell your name and e-mail address to other on-line marketers of products or services without your consent. You make the decisions on how you would like to hear from us and if you are interested in receiving our newsletter and any valuable offers from reputable marketers of products and services. You can change your preference at any time by going to your [Your Account](https://web.archive.org/web/20021204210520id_/http%3A//belchfire.net/modules.php?name=Your_Account) page at Belchfire.net (you will need to do this for each account, if you have more than one).

When you choose to participate in these sweepstakes or promotional offers, you may link to these businesses' websites and be asked to give them personal information or we may send over your personal information if you enter it on the Belchfire.net website. These businesses operate independently from Belchfire.net. Any personal information that is given to them is at your option and is no longer controlled by our privacy policy. To avoid confusion, we will identify these businesses as independent from Belchfire.net, if the information entry point is inside of the Belchfire.net's website. We encourage you to read these businesses' privacy policies, if you should have any concerns about how they will care for your personal information.
