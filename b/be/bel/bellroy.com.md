## PRIVACY POLICY

Bellroy is dedicated to keeping your details private. Any information we collect in relation to you is kept strictly secured. We do not pass on, sell or swap any of your personal details with anyone else. We use this information to identify your orders, provide you with Bellroy updates (if requested) and to personalise your shopping experience with us.

Bellroy uses cookies to allow you to login to your account and to maintain a shopping cart between sessions. Bellroy will work without cookies enabled, but they allow us to give you a more friendly, interesting and enjoyable shopping experience.

We use remarketing (sometimes called retargeting) to better target our ads to interested customers. When you visit the Bellroy site, you may see additional Bellroy ads on participating websites, including the Google Display Network and Facebook. You can change your advertising preferences and view additional information using the [Ads Preference Manager](https://www.google.com/settings/ads/onweb/?hl=en&sig=ACi0TCg4VHd0m21adYaAg9yNDxJFQTiTSdorWliAwloVbVUTgmchctwp2GJgAjNVdX5eTnvU_liK7Nw1FGvAO2MinLUps2ts4sc__SSyVF7FCU6gglVus727677iacDuZaJDGl9s2vkWKy9gmbFnJTyVHgeNeMVjqG3WCh_5C10Gqr73KbdwD0__6mf5ax3UV_6tHffg9HzX). Personally identifiable information is never disclosed.

Whenever you use our web site, or any other web site, the computer on which the web pages are stored (the Web server) needs to know the network address of your computer so that it can send the requested web pages to your Internet browser. The unique network address of your computer is called its "IP address," and is sent automatically each time you access any Internet site. From a computer's IP address, it is possible to determine the general geographic location of that computer but otherwise it is anonymous.

We do not keep a record of the IP addresses from which users access our site except where you have specifically provided us with information about yourself, in which case we also record your IP address for security purposes. An example of this would be when signing in to your account or proceeding to a checkout to finalise an order you may wish to make.
