# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 24, 2016 

## Welcome to BeLive Studios! 

We, BeLive Studios Ltd. and our corporate affiliates ("we" or "us"), highly value and respect your privacy. This privacy policy ("Policy") outlines which information we collect when you ("you" or "your") access and use the website, mobile application (the "App"), products and services provided by us (which, together, are referred to as the "Services"), for the broadcast of live streams via Facebook Live, and how we protect and use it. The Policy also wishes to make sure that you are aware of the options available to you when you access and use our Services. 

Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the Policy before using our Services, and e-mail us at team@belive.tv to let us know if you have any questions. 

By accessing or using our Services, you agree to this Policy and to our [Terms of Service](https://belive.tv/tos). If you do not agree to this Policy or Terms of Service, please do not access or otherwise use our Services or any information contained herein. 

We reserve the right, at our discretion, to amend, change, update, or modify this Policy from time to time by modification and posting on our website and/or on our App. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting, and will apply to causes of action arising after the effective date of the change. It is your responsibility to check the website, the App and this Policy for changes to ensure that you continue to agree with all of its terms. Your continued use of our Services following the posting of changes to this Policy or providing notice to you, whichever occurs first, means that you accept those changes. 

As a user-generated live video broadcasting platform, we allow you to submit, upload, post or broadcast content (including without limitation information, video, sounds, images, photos, clips, musical works, works of authorship, usernames, data, notes, text, documents, files, messages, signs, symbols, icons, drawings, animation, graphics, charts, designs, scripts, code, audio, comments, software, applications, links, and other materials) via Facebook Live. Anything that you or other users submit, upload, post, broadcast or otherwise make available on our Services is referred to as "User Content". This Policy does not govern in any way our relationship with respect to User Content (including without limitation, any rights, obligations, licenses, etc. we or you may hold in that respect). The User Content that you share, submit, upload, post, broadcast or otherwise make available is neither private nor confidential. This means that others via Facebook Live and third parties may search for, see, use, view, copy or share any of your User Content that you make publicly available through the Service and you should not have any expectation of privacy with respect to it. Therefore, you must exercise caution and common sense when sharing, submitting, uploading, broadcasting and/or posting User Content. For the relevant terms and conditions, please see our Terms of Service. 

## Information We Collect 

A. Information you provide us or give us permission to obtain. 

When you register to any of our Services or use any of them, you may be asked to provide us with certain personal information ("Personal Information") and other information that does not identify you. If you access our services through our mobile App, we may collect information from your mobile device’s photos/gallery, following receipt of confirmation from you. Any information you provide us is provided by you voluntarily. However, certain information is required in order for you to register and enjoy the full benefits of our Services. You may also give us permission to access your personal and non-personal information contained in services provided by other sources. For example, when you register for a BeLive account, you will be asked to connect this account with your Facebook or Twitter account, which will allow us to obtain information from it (e.g., your profile picture or its URL, friends list, Facebook ID number, gender, your birthday or age range, and other publicly available information on Facebook). The information we obtain from Facebook usually depends on your privacy settings, your friends' privacy settings or the Facebook privacy policy, so you should also check what those are. You can always revoke your consent to our ongoing ability to collect information from your device’s phonebook and photos by changing the settings on your device, if your device offers that option, or by simply deleting our App from your device. 

  
B. Information we collect from your use of the Services. 

Website Log and Device Information - When you use our Services, we may automatically collect certain information, including information that your browser sends whenever you visit a website. This information may include, for example, your Internet Protocol (IP) address, how you used our Services, the frequency and scope of your use of the Services, the content you viewed (including advertisements you clicked on), pages you visited, your communications with other users and third parties, your browser type and settings, language, access times cookie data, the referring website address, version of software installed, and the geographic location of the computer system that you are using to log-in. When you submit, upload, post or broadcast User Content such as videos on our Services, we may receive additional related data (or metadata), such as the time, date, and place you took the video. In addition, we may collect information about the device you are using our Services on, such as the type of the device, the hardware model, operating system version, your device and hardware settings, unique device identifiers, and crash data. As such, the information we collect may be “personally identifiable” (meaning it can be used to specifically identify you as a unique person) or “non-personally identifiable information” (meaning it can’t be used to specifically identify you). We use both types of information, and combinations of both types, as described above. 

Mobile Device - When you use a mobile device like a tablet or phone to access our Services, we may automatically collect and store information, such as your operating system, version, device manufacturer and model, and other information about your mobile device as well as time spent in the App. We may also generate a unique device identifier for use by us to operate the Service. Device identifiers are small data files or similar data structures stored on or associated with your mobile device, which uniquely identify your mobile device. We may also collect different types of information about your location, including general information (e.g., IP address, zip code) and more specific information (e.g., GPS-based functionality on mobile devices used to access the Services), including Personal Information, and may use that information to customize the Services. You hereby authorize us and our App to access such components of your mobile device. You can grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent us from continuing to access your GPS information by disabling the GPS or other location-tracking functions on your device, provided your device allows you to do this. 

Local storage - Certain features of the Services may require access to your device's media storage applications. Although you decide whether or not to use these features, on most devices you can easily grant or revoke your consent at any time and prevent the App from accessing your video storage applications by changing the settings on your mobile device according to the specific instructions provided by the technology provider. 

Information collected by Cookies and similar technologies – A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device for record keeping purposes. Cookies can only be read by the server that sent them, and they cannot read data from the hard drive. We and/or our service providers, may use cookies (and similar technologies) to collect and store certain information, such as your registration information, language preferences and other account settings, so you don't have to set them up every time you use our Services. We may also use these technologies to recognize your browser type as you navigate on the Internet and to collect aggregate and statistic information about your online activity on our site, such as the web pages you visit, the links you click, and the searches you conduct on our site. This allows us to better serve you with more tailored information and facilitate your ongoing access to and use of the Services. Any user IDs, passwords, and any other user or account related data that we store in such cookies are encrypted for security purposes. We may allow our authorized service providers to access the information collected by cookies from our website or App to allow them to assist us in various activities, such as doing analysis and research on the effectiveness of our site, content and advertising. To learn more about cookies, please visit <http://www.allaboutcookies.org/>. You may delete or decline cookies by changing your browser settings. However, if you refuse to accept cookies, you won't be able to access and take advantage of many features of our Services properly. 

Please be advised that the cookies of other third-party vendors or ad networks may also be used to serve ads, and therefore, please be informed as follows: 

• Third-party vendors and ad networks may serve ads on our website/App. 

• You may visit the websites of such third-party vendors and ad networks to opt out of the use of cookies for interest-based advertising (if the vendor or ad network offers this capability). Alternatively, you can opt out of some third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting <http://www.aboutads.info/>. 

Information collected by third parties - We may allow third parties, including our authorized service providers, advertising companies, and ad networks, to display advertisements on our site and/or App (we do not sell your Personal Information to any of the foregoing). Note that these parties may use tracking technologies, such as cookies, to collect information about users who view or interact with their advertisements. This information allows them to deliver targeted advertisements and gauge their effectiveness. Some of these third party advertising companies may be advertising networks that are members of the Network Advertising Initiative, which offers end users a single location to opt out of ad targeting from member companies ( [www.networkadvertising.org](http://www.networkadvertising.org/)). Unless expressly stated otherwise, our website does not provide Personal Information to these third parties. This Policy does not apply to, and we cannot control the tracking technologies and activities of, those other advertisers, third-party advertising networks, or third-party advertising servers. 

While using the Services, you may be directed to a third party site, for example to login to your Facebook or Twitter account which may take you to Facebook’s site. Once you’ve left this site, you will be subject to that site’s Privacy Policy (and other terms and conditions of use), and you should review it to determine how your data will be used. In other words this Privacy Policy will no longer apply to Personal Information or any other data collected from or provided by you after you have left this site.

## When And With Whom We May Share The Information We Collect? 

We value your privacy and will not share your Personal Information with third parties, except in the following instances: 

A. When we received your permission. This includes sharing information with other services (like Facebook or Twitter) when you have chosen to link those services to your account or publish your activity on our Services to them. 

B. When we have given you notice. Such as by sending you an e-mail to the e-mail address you provided us when registering for our Services, or by informing you about it in this Policy. 

C. When we employ third parties to process Personal Information on our behalf. Such third parties' use will be subject to instructions given by us and in compliance with this Policy. For example, we may provide data to our accountants to make sure we are keeping our books right, or we may engage a security consultant to help us better identify spam. 

D. With our affiliates. This relates to entities that are legally part of the same group of companies that we are part of, or that become part of that group. 

E. In case of change of control. If we engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganization, or similar transaction or proceeding, we may transfer the information to our new owner. 

F. We may disclose Personal Information (i) as a response to a legal request (such as a court order, search warrant, or subpoena) if we believe that we are required to do so by applicable law; or (ii) when we believe that such disclosure or use is necessary in order to: reveal, prevent and address fraud and other illegal activities; enforce this Policy or our Terms of Service, including in order to investigate potential breaches; protect our rights, property or safety, or those of our users or from members of the public from harm, as required or permitted by applicable law; and prevent death or imminent bodily harm. 

G. Non-Personally Identifiable Information. We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information that we collect under any of the above circumstances with our business partners, affiliates or other third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on our websites and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-personally identifiable information we collect with additional non-personal information collected from other sources. We may also share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. This information does not contain any personal information and may be used to develop website/App content and services that we hope you and other users will find interesting and to customize content and advertising. 

## How Can You Access Your Information? 

You can change your information at any time by editing your profile. You are responsible to make all necessary changes to correct any information on your account which is not accurate, complete or updated. Please keep in mind that false, incorrect, or outdated information may prevent you from registering to our Services and impair our ability to provide you with Services. 

Your Choices with Respect to Your Information 

Here are some examples to how you can manage your information and the access of others to it: 

A. Even though this may limit or preclude your access to our Services altogether, you can of course choose not to provide us with any information. 

B. You can add or update information. 

C. You can modify your notification settings in your account settings at any time.

E. You may be able to limit access to your Personal Information stored on the mobile device or software you use to access our Services (see the information provided by the mobile device or software provider). 

## How Do We Secure Your Information? 

We consider data security a top priority and we do our best to keep your Personal Information secure. For that purpose, we: 

A. Encrypt all of our services using SSL. 

B. Employ firewalls and intrusion detection systems. 

C. Practice administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect the information you provide us. 

Although we take organizational, technical and administrative measures to protect your Personal Information, no method of transmitting or storing electronic data is ever completely secure. Therefore you cannot reasonably expect and we cannot promise or guarantee that such information will be immune from any wrongdoings, malfunctions, unlawful interceptions or access, or other kinds of abuse and misuse. Please be aware that we may use third-party cloud service providers that provide hosting, data storage and other services pursuant to their standard terms and conditions that are generally non-negotiable, and accordingly, we may be unable to impose contractual obligations on them with respect to the measures they use to protect Personal Information. 

If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the "Contact Us" section below. 

## Protection of Children’s Privacy 

IF YOU ARE UNDER 13 YEARS OF AGE, THEN PLEASE DO NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR IN ANY MANNER. 

Our Services are not directed to children under 13. 

Protecting the privacy of young children is especially important. For that reason, we do not knowingly collect or maintain Personal Information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If we learn that Personal Information of persons under 13-years-of-age has been collected by us on or through the Services, we are committed to take the appropriate steps to delete this information. 

If it comes to our attention through reliable means that a registered user is a child under 13 years of age, we will cancel that user's account and/or access to the Services. 

General, Governing Law and Jurisdiction 

We reserve the right to discontinue or modify any aspect of the Services at any time. This Policy, together with our Terms of Service and any other legal notices published by us on our website and in the App, shall constitute the entire agreement between us concerning the Services. If any provision of this Policy is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Policy, which shall remain in full force and effect, provided, however, that in such event this Policy shall be interpreted so as to give effect, to the greatest extent consistent with, and permitted by, applicable law, to the meaning and intention of the excluded provision as determined by such court of competent jurisdiction. 

This Policy shall be governed by the laws of the State of Israel, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. We each agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Tel Aviv, Israel, and waive any jurisdictional, venue, or inconvenient forum objections to such courts. Our Services are controlled and operated from Israel, and we make no representations that they are appropriate or available for use in other locations. 

### NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL USERS: 

We are private company headquartered and incorporated in Israel. If you are located outside of such country, the personal information you provide to us may be transferred to it and governed by its applicable laws and regulations and this Policy. Some of this information may be transferred to, processed and stored temporarily by our service providers in other countries. By submitting your personal information, you consent to its transfer to and storage in the country where our headquarters are located and other countries designated by us, its governance by Israeli laws and regulations, and its use in accordance with this Policy
