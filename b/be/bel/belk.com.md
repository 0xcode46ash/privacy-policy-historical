**What personally identifiable information does belk.com collect?**

Belk collects personal information that you provide when using belk.com. This personal information is gathered when you register on belk.com, make a purchase on belk.com, create a wedding registry on belk.com, or register with one of our other services such as Belk mobile, Belk apps, or a Belk social media application (i.e. Facebook) or a Belk software application (i.e., a widget).

When you register on belk.com, you provide us with your email address and a unique password.

When you make a purchase on belk.com, we collect your name, address, phone number, email address and other personal information necessary to fulfill, track and bill your order. In order to bill you for your purchase we also collect credit card information including your card type, credit card number, and expiration date. We also collect shipping address information that allows us to ship your order. This includes the name, address and phone number of the intended recipient.

When you register and checkout, we save your shipping and billing address information. You may elect to have us save your credit card information to expedite future purchases. If you so elect, we save your card type, credit card number, expiration date, and name on the card. You may checkout as a guest if you don't want us to save your shipping, billing or credit card information.

You may change saved shipping, billing, or credit card information at any time. Simply go to the My Account page, login with your email address and password, follow the appropriate links and edit or delete whatever personal information you wish.

We also collect personal information when you become a registrant of our wedding registry. When you sign up for a wedding registry with belk.com, only one account is needed for you and your future spouse. If you already have a belk.com account, you can add the wedding registry to your current account. However, if you do not have an account, you can register for one by providing an email address and a password.

The following information is collected and required from the bride or groom to complete the registry process: name, address (able to use up to 3 shipping addresses), phone number, email address, a local Belk store(s) your guests may shop, your special event(s) details and any email addresses of the guests/family members with whom you wish to share your registry. When you register with Belk you are given the option to 'share your registry' with your family and guests. After you provide the email addresses of family members/guests, only one email will be sent out pertaining to your wedding registry. This email will come directly from the bride's or groom's own email account, not Belk's. Your family/guests have the option of receiving future emails about your registry, if they so choose. Again, anyone who receives this email from the bride or groom has the option of unsubscribing to any email about her or his registry. Under no circumstance will Belk send any store promotional events or sales to your family/guests email accounts, unless they specifically stated they wish to receive them.

You can update your Belk wedding registry at any time. Simply login to your account with the email address and password you created when you registered with Belk.

There are a few other instances when belk.com may collect other personal information from you. Occasionally we conduct contests on belk.com. If you choose to participate in an online contest, we may request personal information from you that will permit us to administer the contest and notify the winner(s). If you contact our Customer Service department, we may store your email address or phone number in order to respond to your questions or requests for assistance. Belk.com reserves the right to keep a record of any communication between you and Belk. 

**How will my personal information be used?**

Information collected on belk.com or one of our other services such as Belk mobile, Belk apps, or a Belk social media application (i.e. Facebook), may be used in the following ways: 

  * Ship merchandise that you purchase online
  * Register you as a member of belk.com 
  * Prevent fraud and bill your credit card for your purchases 
  * Confirm and track your orders 
  * Respond to your customer service inquiries 
  * Provide promotional communication and other information to you, if you choose to receive them
  * Source and offer the products you want 
  * Customize your shopping experience 
  * Improve our website design
  * Comply with valid legal procedures, requirements, regulations or statutes



**Is my personal information shared with third parties?**

When you visit belk.com or visit one of our other services such as Belk mobile, Belk apps, or a Belk social media application (i.e. Facebook) and submit personal information, you are sharing that information with belk.com and the Belk-owned and controlled family of companies. We may provide your personal information to our agents, representatives and service providers for limited purposes, including but not limited to, billing customer orders, fulfilling customer orders; communicating to customers; providing customer service; administering opt-in contests or sweepstakes; offering targeted marketing communications to users that opted-in to receive such communications; providing a personalized shopping experience; and preventing online fraud. In addition, we may share your information with Synchrony Bank, the issuer of the Belk Rewards Card to allow them to provide you with information and offers relating to the Belk Rewards Card program. Except as stated herein, we do not sell, trade, rent or give out your personal information to third parties for their marketing purposes. 

If you make a transaction on belk.com with your Belk Rewards Card, the information sharing terms of the Synchrony Bank (SYNCB) Privacy Policy will apply. If and when you choose to sign up for a Belk Rewards Card, administered by Synchrony Bank, you will be informed of the SYNCB Privacy Policy which includes its disclosure on information sharing. The SYNCB Privacy Policy is also always available on the Belk Credit Services Online. All Belk Rewards Cardholders have the right to opt-out from having personal information shared with certain third parties. For more information, please see the 'It's Your Choice' section in the SYNCB Privacy Policy: 

[Synchrony Bank Privacy Policy ](https://www.onlinecreditcenter2.com/Belk/privacy.html)

Finally, we may be required to disclose your personal information to third parties if necessary to comply with applicable laws, subpoenas or court orders. 

**How you control the collection, usage and distribution of any personal information you provide to belk.com**

As customers ourselves, Belk understands and values the importance of giving you, the customer, complete control over the collection, usage and distribution of your personal information. 

If you are a registered customer on belk.com, we will store the information you provide for a quick and easy checkout process every time you place an order with us. However, if you want to make a purchase, but do not want to register with belk.com, you can do so without belk.com having access to your information. During this 'Checkout as a Guest' process, you will still be asked for your name, shipping address, billing address, phone number, email and credit card number. Once you have made your purchase, we will send you an email confirming your order and a shipping notification email that includes a tracking number for your reference. The information you provide during the Guest Checkout process will only be used to process your order and will not be accessible again to anyone at belk.com, or to you. Unless you elect to register for a belk.com account, you will have to re-enter your information each time you make a purchase. 

You may update, correct or delete your personal information at any time by logging into your belk.com account and saving any changes you make. At Belk, we encourage you to keep any information you provide to us as current as possible, so we can ensure we are serving your needs to the best of our ability. 

**How we protect the security of your personal information**

The security of your personal information is very important to Belk. Belk.com uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard for Internet Commerce transaction security, to encrypt your credit card and personal information as it travels over the Internet to our secure servers. SSL technology encrypts, or encodes, your credit card and personal information, preventing an unauthorized party from accessing and viewing it. When you enter a secure portion of belk.com, such as 'Checkout' or 'My Account', your web browser should display a URL address with an "https" prefix and an image of a closed lock or a solid key should appear in the bottom bar of your browser window. In addition, we employ an outside third party company to periodically test the security of our servers and ensure that all credit card and personal information is properly safeguarded. As a result, you can shop with confidence on belk.com. 

In the unlikely event unauthorized charges (as determined by your card issuer) are made on your credit card as a result of purchases made on belk.com utilizing our secure servers, Belk will reimburse you for up to $50 of any amount you are required to pay by the card issuer. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA), Federal law limits your responsibility for unauthorized charges to $50; thus, Belk will cover you for this liability. In the event of an unauthorized use of your credit card, please notify the card issuer in writing as soon as possible. 

For your convenience, below are the toll-free numbers of the credit cards we accept on belk.com:

Belk Rewards Card'1-800-669-6550  
MasterCard'1-800-627-8372  
Discover'1-800-DISCOVER or 1-800-347-2683  
Visa'1-800-847-2911  
American Express'1-800-528-4800 

Finally, your personal information is protected by the password you created when you signed up for an account at belk.com. You may change this password anytime by accessing the My Account section of belk.com. Please keep this password confidential. No representative of belk.com, including our Customer Service representatives, will ever ask you for your password. 

**Mobile Privacy**

Belk offers mobile applications (commonly known as "apps") that allow you to shop online, check product availability, learn about store events, or receive other information from Belk. This Privacy Policy protects all personal information collected by Belk from our mobile applications.

Although you do not have to provide your location information to Belk to use our mobile applications, some store-specific services may require a zip code to function. You may manually enter your zip code and Belk will save your zip code(s) for future reference. Or, when you download our mobile application, you may choose to allow it to obtain your precise location from your mobile device when you click the "location finder" button. In this case, we will determine your zip code from the precise location data received from your mobile device. We do not store precise location data; we only store the zip code associated with the location. Our mobile applications offer push (or "automatic") notifications. We will provide push notifications only to customers who opt-in to receive such notifications from Belk. If you have questions about location and notification privacy, please contact your mobile service provider or the manufacturer of your device to learn how to adjust your settings.

In the future, we may offer updated or enhanced versions of our mobile applications that include additional features created by us or using third party functionality. Our applications or the third party may automatically collect information about your precise location from your device, but only if you allow it.

**Cookies and other computer information**

When you visit belk.com, or visit one of our other services such as Belk mobile, Mobile apps, or a Belk social media application (i.e. Facebook), small text files known as "cookies" will be stored on your computer's hard drive. The purpose of these cookies is to identify you when you visit belk.com, so that we can enhance and customize your online shopping experience. 

You can choose to browse on belk.com without cookies. However, if you disable cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of certain features of our site such as storing your shopping bag for a future visit and providing a more personalized experience. However, disabling cookies will not prevent you from shopping and purchasing on belk.com in the future. You may also change the settings of your browser to reject cookies. Each browser is different, so check your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to update your cookie preferences. 

Cookies also collect certain technical information from your computer. This technical information may include your Internet Protocol (IP) address, your computer's operating system, browser type and the address of a referring website, if any. The information stored in a cookie cannot be used to personally identify you unless combined with information that you have provided in connection with a registration or purchase, or when choosing to sign up for promotional emails or contests. 

We also contract with third parties to provide us with survey data and web analytics data such as tracking the navigation activity of browsers and buyers on our site. We also use third parties for tracking and measuring performance of our marketing efforts and your response to our marketing efforts; and the delivery of relevant marketing messages. All these third parties may use cookies and Web beacons (1 x 1 pixels), and may receive anonymous information about your browsing and buying activity on our site. None of your personally identifiable information (such as your name, address, email address, credit card number, etc.) will be received by or shared with these third parties. If you do not want your non-personal information used by these third parties, you can change the settings of your browser to reject cookies. Again, each browser is different, so check your browser's "Help" menu to learn how to update your cookie preferences. 

The Network Advertising Initiative also provides consumers with a tool for examining your computer, to identify which companies have placed an advertising cookie file on your computer. By following some simple directions, you can then choose to opt out of any online advertising that you do not wish to receive. Visit the [NAI Opt-Out Tool](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp) webpage for more details. 

**How can I decide what promotional email communications I will receive?**

Occasionally, belk.com will send you email to inform you of special events and promotions about our products and services, but only if you indicated interest when you registered for an account on belk.com or opted-in to receive Belk emails. 

If you originally signed up to receive promotional emails, but you have decided you no longer wish to receive them, it is easy to let us know. When you receive an email from us, at the bottom of your email we give you instructions to unsubscribe to Belk email. 

**How can I receive promotional text messages (SMS/MMS)?**

By joining Belk's text messaging program you may receive reoccurring promotional SMS (text messages) about Belk products, services, sales or sweepstakes. To choose to receive Belk promotional messages via SMS on your mobile phone please follow the below steps. 

  * To opt-in to Belk SMS Alerts, text JOIN to 23551 for coupons and sale notifications. Subscribers will receive messages each week. 
  * To opt-out of Belk SMS Alerts, text STOP to 23551.
  * At any time, you can choose to discontinue receiving such promotional SMS by unsubscribing.



**Location Based Offers:** Belk enables you to receive special discounts when you are in the neighborhood of a Belk store. When you have opted-in and we have a deal for you, Belk will check how close you are to one of our stores and send you a text message deal based on how near you are to a Belk store. Your physical location is being collected in order to provide this service. **You can opt-out at any time from both messaging and location checks by sending STOP to 23551.**   
Belk location based messaging is available only on AT&T, Boost Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Nextel, Sprint, T-Mobile®, Verizon Wireless, Tier 2/3 Carrier Group and Associated Carrier Group. The location service will not be available if the phone is roaming or is turned off. Other Network Carriers will be added as they become available. Location coordinates (longitude, latitude, and radius) will be obtained only when we have proper authorization from you, as a registered user. Mobile phone user privacy is extremely important to us at Belk. Location coordinates are only gathered after you have agreed to use this service. We will not disclose your location information to other users without your consent. Your location information is retained only as long as necessary to provide the service.

**Privacy Protection of Children**

At Belk, we want to make sure that everyone in your family is protected. Belk acknowledges and abides by all website requirements in accordance with The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act that has been in effect since April 21, 2000. We do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13 at any time. Belk.com is a website for a general audience, not geared towards children. The only instance where we would collect information from a child under the age of 13 is if the child's parent or guardian was given notice and the option to provide their personal information. For more information about this act, please visit the Federal Trade Commission's website: 

[Facts for Consumers: How to Protect Kids' Privacy Online](http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/tech/tec08.shtm)

If this act changes in anyway, we will revise the Privacy Policy of belk.com to comply with all requirements of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. 

**Linking to Third Party Web Sites**

Belk.com may provide links to certain third party websites. This Privacy Policy applies only to activities conducted and personal information collected on belk.com.
