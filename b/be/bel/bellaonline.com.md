 **How We Collect Information**

This Website collects information that falls into one of two categories - personally identifiable information and aggregated information. Personally identifiable information is information that can be used to identify you. Aggregated information is information that is not associated with a specific user, such as the number of people who visit the Website from various states.

We collect personally identifiable information whenever you voluntarily submit it to the Website. Examples of this type information include when you answer our polls, enter sweepstakes or contests, fill out the registration page, send us feedback or post in our chat rooms or message boards. You always have the option of choosing not to reveal this personally identifiable information to us, although certain services may be unavailable if you do not. In the event of a complaint, we may also receive and collect personally identifiable information about you from other parties in our Website or from other users or third parties who may communicate information to us about you in relation to that complaint.

In addition, we collect and store statistics and other information about the online activities of our visitors on an aggregated (collective) basis. For example, we track the number of people who view each page, the order in which pages are viewed, and other information to learn which features are the most popular and to refine our design and marketing efforts.

 **Information We Gather or Track**

Information on general usage and any optional personal details you provide to us will be used to provide you with enhanced features such as customized content, access to our Chat Rooms and message boards, and the ability to participate in any of our BellaOnline communities. The following are details of the information we collect: 

  * BellaOnline, Inc. collects data so that we may display personalized content to our visitors. Additionally, usage information may be analyzed so that we can judge our system's performance or execute your customized features. 
  * Your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (InternetProtocol), address. This can tell us things like what part of the world you're connecting from. Or what service provider you are using. 
  * Your browser offers so-called "cookies" which -- if you allow their use -- store small amounts of data on your computer about your visit to any of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features you like best. And when you re-visit our site, cookies can enable us to customize our content according to your preferences. However, cookies tell us nothing about you personally unless you specifically give us additional information. 
  * Our registration form asks for contact and demographic information used to send news about our products or promotional material from our partners. You will be able to opt-out of receiving any mailings. Demographic information may be used to customize the display of our site to you by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to your past visits. 
  * Surveys may ask for contact information or unique identifying information to increase the value of the results. Contests may require contact information or other demographic/personal information in order to determine your eligibility. 
  * Some of the banner ads displayed in our site are provided by outside companies. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about you. 



**How We Use and Disclose Your Information**

Both aggregated and personally identifiable information is used to operate and enhance our site and enhance your on-site experience by displaying content and marketing messages that we believe will be of interest to you.

We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. _However this does **not** include personally identifiable information about you or your online usage patterns._ Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to you. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers. 

We'll use your email contact information to provide you with newsletters to which you subscribe, or for similar information we think you may find of interest. However, you can choose to opt out of these mailings.

  * Please be aware that if you voluntarily disclose information online, personal or otherwise, that information can be collected and used by others.
