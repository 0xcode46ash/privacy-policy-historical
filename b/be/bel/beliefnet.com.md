# Privacy Policy - About Us - Beliefnet.com

**Effective as of October 20, 2008.**

Beliefnet, Inc. (“Beliefnet” or “we” or “us”) is part of the News America Group, which has adopted a set of Privacy Principles (the “Principles”) (<http://www.newscorp.com/privacy.html>) applicable to all its U.S.-based companies. Beliefnet has implemented those Principles in this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”), which describes how we collect, use and share personally identifiable information (“PII”) we obtain online from and about individuals located in the U.S.

Beliefnet’s web site ([http://www.beliefnet.com](http://www.beliefnet.com/)) and all other related web sites owned or controlled by us (collectively or individually the “Site”) are general audience web sites, and we do not knowingly collect PII from children under 13 years of age.

Our Privacy Policy applies to "Visitors,” which means that you simply browse the Site, “Subscribers,” which means that you have subscribed to receive one or more Beliefnet newsletter or partner emails and "Members," which means that you have registered with Beliefnet. The term "User" refers to a Visitor, Subscriber or a Member. By using our Site, you signify your agreement with all the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use our Site.

From time to time Beliefnet may revise this Privacy Policy to reflect industry initiatives or changes in the law, our PII collection and use practices, the features of our Site or technology. If we make revisions that change the way we collect or use your PII, Beliefnet will post those changes in this Privacy Policy and the effective date will be noted at the beginning of such Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Site after Beliefnet posts a revised Privacy Policy signifies your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy. Therefore, you should review it periodically so that you are up to date on our most current policies and practices.

This Privacy Policy describes the types of other companies that may want to send you information about their products and services and therefore may want to share your PII, provided you have given Beliefnet permission to do so (See Section D (Use: _Beliefnet’s Use of PII_ ) below).

Beliefnet’s Site may be linked to Internet web sites operated by other companies. Some of these third party web sites may be co-branded with a Beliefnet logo, even though they are not operated or maintained by Beliefnet (for example, the co-sponsored chat pages, or advertising sponsor pages). Beliefnet’s Site also carries advertisements from other companies. Beliefnet is not responsible for the privacy practices of web sites operated by third parties that are linked to our Site or for the privacy practices of third party or national Internet advertising companies.

_**C. CHOICE: BELIEFNET WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH CHOICES ABOUT THE USE OF YOUR PII**_

Beliefnet will not use the PII you provide to us for purposes different from the purpose for which it was submitted, or share your PII with third parties that are not affiliated with Beliefnet (i.e., not part of the News America Group), unless we obtain your permission.

**_D. USE: BELIEFNET’S USE OF PII_**

Beliefnet will use your PII provided under this Privacy Policy in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If Beliefnet obtains PII from a third party, such as a business partner, our use of that information is governed by this Privacy Policy.

Beliefnet may share your PII with companies that are affiliated with us, that is, are part of the News America Group of companies. Provided you have given us permission, Beliefnet may also share your PII with advertisers and business partners that are not affiliated with Beliefnet, but would like to send you information about their products and services. For example, Beliefnet may share your PII with the companies who supply prizes for Beliefnet’s contests and may have special offers or promotions that might be of interest to Beliefnet users. However, you will always have the opportunity to instruct us not to share your information with third parties when PII is collected. Moreover, we will never share your credit card information with third parties except those Beliefnet uses to perform tasks (such as order fulfillment and payment processing) required to complete purchases you make through Beliefnet Sites.

Beliefnet employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate business reason to obtain access to your PII. Beliefnet may share your PII with outside contractors or agents who help us manage our information activities (i.e., sweepstakes administration, order fulfillment, statistical analyses) but they may only use your PII to provide Beliefnet with a specific service and not for any other purpose.

Beliefnet may also enter into agreements with outside companies that possess the technology that allows Beliefnet to customize the advertising and marketing messages you receive on our Site. Your non-PII and click stream data about your activities on our Site may be shared with these companies so this customization may be accomplished. These companies will not share your information with any third party or use it for any other purpose. Anonymous click stream and demographic information may also be shared with Beliefnet’s advertisers and business partners.

There may be instances when Beliefnet may disclose PII without providing you with a choice in order to protect the legal rights of Beliefnet, other companies within the News America Group or their employees, agents and contractors; to protect the safety and security of visitors to our Site; to protect against fraud or for risk management purposes; or to comply with the law or legal process. In addition, if Beliefnet sells all or part of its business or makes a sale or transfer of assets or is otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, Beliefnet may transfer your PII to a third party as part of that transaction.

**_E. SECURITY: BELIEFNET PROTECTS THE SECURITY OF PII_**

Beliefnet uses reasonable administrative, technical, personnel and physical measures to safeguard PII in its possession against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure or modification. In addition, Beliefnet uses reasonable methods to make sure that PII is accurate, up-to-date and appropriately complete. However, no security system is impenetrable. Beliefnet cannot warrant or guarantee the security of its servers, nor can it guarantee that information that you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to Beliefnet over the Internet.

_**F. ACCESS: HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT OR DELETE YOUR**_ _**PII**_

Whenever possible, Members and Subscribers may review the PII we maintain about them in our records. We will take reasonable steps to correct any PII a Member or Subscriber informs us of in writing is incorrect. If you are a Member, you can view, change and remove your PII, Member preferences and Your Profile information by logging into your account and accessing “Edit Profile.” Section A(1)(b) above describes how to change your subscriptions preferences.

If for any reason you want Beliefnet to stop using your PII, Beliefnet will honor that request; however, Beliefnet will retain any record of your PII that is necessary to comply with applicable federal, state or local law. Keep in mind, moreover, that there will be residual information that will remain within Beliefnet's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such PII. Even after removal of PII and User Content by you or Beliefnet, PII and User Content may still be viewable in cached and archived pages or if another User has stored your User Content.
