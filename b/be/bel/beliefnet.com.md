|  **Information About All Beliefnet Visitors**   
In general, our service automatically gathers certain usage information, for example the number and frequency of visitors to Beliefnet and its areas. We use such data only in the aggregate.

|  **Cookies**   
In our effort to provide you services customized to your interests, we use "cookies" to keep and sometimes track information about you. A cookie is a small piece of data that is sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to: access your account information (stored on our computers) in order to deliver better and more personalized services; estimate our audience size for our advertisers; identify which areas of our site you have visited; and prevent users from voting in polls more then once.

We may also use that information to let you know about additional products and services that may interest you. You can choose not to receive such information by letting us know on the registration screen when you sign up for the product or service. We may ask you for information about your interests so that both you and we can take advantage of the interactivity of the online medium, but you may always choose not to respond.
