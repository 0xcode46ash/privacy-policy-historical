Last Revised: October 05, 2007 

Beliefnet ("Beliefnet", "we"â€šÂ orâ€š "us"Â) is strongly committed to protecting the privacy of your personal information, and providing a safe and secure environment for our users. For that reason, we follow a privacy policy (the "Privacy Policy"Â) that applies to our web site (the"Site"Â) and our distribution of various newsletters. As part of our Privacy Policy, we want you to understand what kinds of information we may gather about you when you visit the Site and when you receive e-mails from us, how we may use that information, whether we will disclose it, and how you can correct the information. Our Privacy Policy applies to visitors who browse the materials on our site and to users who choose to register with Beliefnet and become "Members"Â. Please note that by using the Site, you signify your agreement with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site. 

If we decide to change our Privacy Policy, we will post those changes here and indicate the date on which the Privacy Policy was updated so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information, and whether we will disclose it. Your continued use of the Site after any changes to the Privacy Policy will mean that you have accepted these changes.

If you are under 13 years of age, you should not register to become a Member or provide any personally identifiable information through the Site.

**_Security_**

Beliefnet uses reasonable security methods to protect the data that resides on our servers. However, no security system is impenetrable.

**_The Information We Gather and How We Use It_**

Beliefnet collects information from you at several different points on the Site in the manner set forth below: 

**1\. Member Registration and Profile**

In order to access certain information and services on the Site, a user must first become a Beliefnet member ("Member") by completing our member registration form. During the registration process you will be required to give information such as your name, e-mail address, zip code, and birth date. The information from your registration will automatically become incorporated into "Your Profile." In the "Your Profile" section of the Site, you have the option to provide further information about yourself, such as your interests, organizations and affiliations, and a written statement of your beliefs. Whenever you make a posting to a message board or otherwise post information or material on our Site, your profile information will be available to users on the Site to view. 

**_Important Information about Changing and Updating Your Member Profile_**

If your profile information changes, or if you no longer desire to be a Member, you may correct, update or remove the personal data that you provided. This can be done at the "Your Profile" page by clicking on the "Edit Your Profile" button. Keep in mind, however, that there will be residual information that will remain within Beliefnet's databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain such personally identifiable information. 

**2\. Surveys, Contests and Quizzes**

We do not use these quiz responses for any purpose. 

On our Site you may also have the opportunity to participate in contests and other promotions which may require you to provide information about yourself.

In addition, if and when we sponsor contests or other promotions, or third parties sponsor such promotions with us, either we or the third party will post relevant privacy information in the official rules and/or registration area for the sweepstakes or promotion. That privacy information, to the extent it conflicts with this Privacy Policy, will govern that particular contest-please remember to read it carefully.
