|   |  Privacy Policy  
Please read this carefully  
28 March 2003 

Before using the Website (that is, any site operated by **Independent News & Media plc** companies) it is your responsibility to read the Privacy Policy. You can notify us in the manner set out below if you do not want us to share information about you with third parties. 

**The basic principles**

By accessing and using the Website you are agreeing to be legally bound by the [**Terms of Use**](https://web.archive.org/web/20031202021310id_/http%3A//www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/story.jsp?story=55087) and this Privacy Policy. You should therefore also read the Terms of Use before using the Website. 

ID is determined to protect your privacy. It is very important to us that you should be able to use and enjoy the Website without having to compromise your privacy unacceptably. 

Knowing something about our users is, however, necessary to ensure that our service is continually improved. We need to build an accurate picture of the needs and wishes of our users, and to be able to communicate with you. That enables us to offer a service that is relevant and truly interactive, which is what our users expect. It also helps us to maintain free-to-user access to much of the Website. 

**We answer your important questions**

_"What information do you collect about me?"_

  * We automatically collect some data about our users' browsing actions and patterns. This is aggregate data and does not identify any individual. 
  * We may also ask you to provide personal information on a voluntary basis in order to get a clearer picture of our users. It is then entirely up to you whether you are happy to give us this information. 
  * In the course of entering competitions, promotions and other online offers you will be asked to give some details about yourself. You may also choose to e–mail us or make contact with us in other ways. Such contact gives us information about you. 
  * If you have any financial dealings or make purchases with our trading partners on co–branded sites, they will ask for certain information. This information may be shared with us. 

_"For what purposes do you collect and use this information?"_

  * We use aggregate audience details (where no individual is identifiable) to help us improve our understanding of our users and their preferences. We use it to assist us in arranging relevant advertising, commercial opportunities and competitions, as well as ensuring the best editorial coverage. It also helps us develop the Website and audit its use. 
  * The information about you as an identifiable individual, including contact details, may be used in the following ways: 
  * to conduct market research and other surveys. 
  * to create and draw to your attention editorial material and commercial opportunities that may be of interest to you. 
  * to be shared with advertisers, trading partners and other commercial entities with whom we have or might have an association. We may also share the information that they obtain about their users, which may include you. 

_"How private are my details?_

  * Apart from other companies in the Independent News & Media group, we only share personal information about you with third parties whom we have selected carefully and with whom we have, or may have, a commercial relationship. ID complies with the relevant legal requirements and takes all reasonable care to ensure that your information is secure and private and is only seen by responsible third parties. However we cannot be held responsible for the actions of any third party who receives or obtains access to the information, nor for any breach of security. 
  * If you tell us that you do not want us to use your details, then data about your use of the Web Site would then only form part of aggregated statistics and would not be related to you as an individual. 
  * You can ask to see the information we have about you by e-mailing a request to [customerservice@independent.co.uk](mailto:customerservice@independent.co.uk). 

_"What do I do if I am not happy for you to share information about me with others?"_

  * You may not wish us to share personal details about you with third parties outside the Group, or to use your information in the other ways we have described in this Privacy Policy. You can e-mail us at [customerservice@independent.co.uk](mailto:customerservice@independent.co.uk) at any time to let us know of any objections you may have to how we use or disclose your data in the ways set out in this Privacy Policy..Your personal details may in any event be shared with third party organisations we have contracted to provide services to us, on an agency basis, which include processing data. We may also have to release information (which could include the contents of e-mail communications between any persons) because of a legal requirement on us or pursuant to a court order. 

_"Do you use cookies?"_

  * Like many other web sites we do use cookies as they enable us to identify you when you visit the Web Site and to develop a clearer picture of our users' preferences. 
  * Cookies are small text files that are sent to your browser when you visit the Web Site and are stored on your hard disc. By identifying your previous visits, they enable you to use the site more effectively and enable us to tailor the site better to suit your needs. 
  * You can find out more about cookies at [www.cookiecentral.com](http://www.cookiecentral.com/). 

**International transfer of personal data**   
As you will know, the Internet does not recognise national boundaries. Services on the net are accessible globally so collection and transmission of personal data is not always confined to one country. You should be aware that by using the Website and those of our partners or any site we link through to, your personal data may be processed in or transferred to other countries, the USA for example, and you agree to your personal data being transferred or processed in this way. 

**Further information**   
If you want further information, or wish to communicate with us about this Privacy Policy and your wishes about your personal information, please e-mail us at [customerservice@independent.co.uk](mailto:customerservice@independent.co.uk).
