Use of Information  
Information about our customers is an important part of our business, and we do not sell it to others.  
Name, address, phone number, customer number, and credit card information are used to ship and bill orders and for future marketing purposes. In addition, phone number and customer number are used in case there is a problem with your order and customer service needs to contact you. Personal information allows our websites to make product recommendations to you. If you provide us with your e-mail address, you may receive periodic e-mail promotions and special offers. 

We also gather data on visitor's movements through our sites. This information is used to improve our service to you and to administer our websites. Data on visitors' home servers is aggregated for internal review. The aggregate information on what pages are visited is used to improve the site content and also for error tracking purposes related to the functioning of the site. Individually identifiable e-mail addresses are not captured or stored for future use, unless you choose to communicate with Bellacor.com, Inc. by posting a message to Bellacor.com, Inc. 

In any communication, be sure to include your name, mailing address, and customer account number.   
Persons who communicate with Bellacor.com, Inc. and therefore supply Bellacor.com, Inc. with an e-mail address may receive future communications from us by e-mail. You can unsubscribe at any time by e-mailing your request to [Customer Service](http://www.bellacor.com/contactUs.cfm?subject=Other). Simply state, "Do not email" in the body of the message. Finally, please note that we also offer links to other third party sites and services. Be aware that these outside parties operate under their own privacy and security policies, and Bellacor.com, Inc. has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies or actions. All internal/external Bellacor.com, Inc. parties, such as employees, agents, and contractors are similarly bound by these privacy and security policies.

Third Party Policy  
Third Party Marketing is defined as a company that has no direct relationship with Bellacor.com, Inc. customers. Third parties will not contact you as a result of your subscribing to our e-mail newsletter and promotions lists except through advertisements within the newsletters themselves. 

We use a third-party service provider to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. They may collect anonymous information about your visits to our Web site, and your interaction with our products and services. They may also use information about your visits to this and other Web sites to target advertisements for goods and services. This anonymous information is collected through the use of a pixel tag, which is industry standard technology used by most major web sites. If you would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this anonymous information used by our third party service provider, please [click here](http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).

To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Cookies  
At Bellacor.com, Inc., we may use cookies to help us provide you with a fast, convenient shopping experience at our online store. A cookie is a data element a website sends to your browser. It is stored on your computer hard drive and tells a website that a previous visitor has returned. It doesn't automatically give personal information about you, like your e-mail address or name. 

If you want to give us personal information through registration, then a cookie will help us deliver content based on your interests and preferences. Cookies also help us monitor whether our websites are functioning properly and to perform site traffic analysis.

Encryption  
Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble sensitive information while it is in transit to Bellacor.com, Inc. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL). SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. It is based on a key that has two different parts: public and private. 

The public part of the key is distributed to those you want to communicate with. The private part is for recipients' use only. When you send personal information to us, you use our public key to encrypt your personal information. That means if your information is intercepted during the transmission, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once we receive your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of our key to decode it. 

Making a credit card purchase online at Bellacor.com, Inc. is just as safe as making a credit card purchase over the telephone. However, if you would prefer to use the phone, just call 1-877-723-5522, and one of our product specialists will gladly take your order (8 am - 5 pm CT, Monday - Friday).

Commitment to Children's Privacy  
Protecting the online privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, Bellacor.com, Inc. voluntarily complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the US Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. (16 C.F.R. Part 312). We neither collect nor maintain information at our site from those actually known to be under the age of 13, nor is any part of our sites directed to children under the age of 13.
