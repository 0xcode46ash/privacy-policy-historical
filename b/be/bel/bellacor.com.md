Bellacor.com, Inc. is committed to the security of information collected on our sites. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online.

Cookies  
At Bellacor.com, Inc., we may use cookies to help us provide you with a fast, convenient shopping experience at our online store. A cookie is a data element a website sends to your browser. It is stored on your computer hard drive and tells a website that a previous visitor has returned. It doesn't automatically give personal information about you, like your e-mail address or name. 

If you want to give us personal information through registration, then a cookie will help us deliver content based on your interests and preferences. Cookies also help us monitor whether our websites are functioning properly and to perform site traffic analysis.

Encryption  
Encryption is a process by which we use software to scramble sensitive information while it is in transit to Bellacor.com, Inc. We use Secure Socket Layering (SSL). SSL technology is the industry standard for secure online transactions. It is based on a key that has two different parts: public and private. 

The public part of the key is distributed to those you want to communicate with. The private part is for recipients' use only. When you send personal information to us, you use our public key to encrypt your personal information. That means if your information is intercepted during the transmission, it is scrambled and very difficult to decrypt. Once we receive your encrypted personal information, we use the private part of our key to decode it. 

Making a credit card purchase online at Bellacor.com, Inc. is just as safe as making a credit card purchase over the telephone. However, if you would prefer to use the phone, just call 1-877-723-5522, and one of our product specialists will gladly take your order (8 am - 5 pm CST, Monday - Friday).

Protecting the online privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, Bellacor.com, Inc. voluntarily complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the US Federal Trade Commission's Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule. (16 C.F.R. Part 312). We neither collect nor maintain information at our site from those actually known to be under the age of 13, nor is any part of our sites directed to children under the age of 13.
