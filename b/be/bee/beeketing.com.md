## Collection of Information from Customer Site End Users

This section describes our policies for internet users that visit Customer Sites. 

Information Collected by Beeketing 

In the course of providing user and usage data analytics Services to our customers, Beeketing collects both non-personally identifiable and personally identifiable information about end users of Customer Sites. Personally Identifiable Information ("PII") collected by Beeketing includes data such as your name, address, phone number, or email address, which you have provided to the Customer Site. Beeketing will not collect your password for any Customer Site or credit card information you have supplied to any Customer Site. We do not purchase or receive information about you from third parties (other than our customers). 

Beeketing also collects non-personally identifiable information about you from Customer Sites you visit, including the following types of data: 

Standard Data – common information found in every communication sent over the internet. Using this information, Beeketing can infer information such as browser type (e.g., Chrome or Internet Explorer); operating system (e.g,. Macintosh or Windows); browser language (e.g., Java or Unix); and internet service provider (e.g., Verizon Fios or AOL) 

Clickstream Data – Beeketing can infer how you use our Customer Sites and various pages on the internet. 

Beeketing may use this PII and non-personally identifiable information to provide our Services to our customers. 

Aggregated Personal Information: In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of the Services, Beeketing often conducts research on its customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal Information and other information provided to us. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and Beeketing may share this aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and business partners. This aggregate information does not identify you personally. Beeketing may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our services to current and prospective business partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes. We partner with third parties that collect information across various channels, including offline and online, for purposes of delivering more relevant advertising to you. We may share personal information with them if you have submitted such information to us, such as your email address, solely in hashed, or non-human readable form. Our partners may link the personal information we share with them to the cookie stored on your browser or device, and they may collect information such as your IP address, browser or operating system type and version, and demographic or inferred-interest information. Our partners use this information to recognize you across different channels and platforms over time for advertising, analytics, attribution, and reporting purposes. To learn more about interest-based advertising in general and to opt out, please visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices.
