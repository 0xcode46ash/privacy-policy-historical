**Statement of Responsible Online Marketing**

Developments in Internet technology have allowed companies to locate, contact, and track potential customers with astonishing ease. While these advances have allowed for fantastic growth in online commerce, they have also opened the way for abuses. To help maintain an online marketplace that benefits all parties, Be Free commits to protect the privacy of consumers and to refrain from unsolicited commercial e-mails. 

**Privacy**

**Be Free does not track the identity or contact information of end users**. Be Free does not record names, phone numbers, or e-mail addresses of end users. It does record IP addresses and it uses cookies to analyze the behavior of anonymous users. These techniques allow Be Free to understand and serve the interests of web users in general, without violating the anonymity of any individual user. For example, the Be Free server can recognize if the same individual clicks through multiple affiliate links, but it cannot identify who that individual is. If visitors prefer that this anonymous tracking not occur, they always have the option to refuse cookies. 

As Be Free manages affiliate programs for its merchant clients, it is possible that Be Free has access on its servers to personally identifiable information on end users. This information belongs to the merchants, and Be Free does not share such information with third parties. Be Free reserves the right to release information on end users to mandated parties if compelled to do so by proper judicial or governmental authorities. At present, all information processing occurs in the United States. 

**Be Free shares neither personally identifiable information about an affiliate nor information about an affiliate's performance with any party but the merchant with whom that affiliate has a contract**. While Be Free does record such information in the application process and retains it in order to serve its merchant clients through processes such as performance reporting and commission payments to affiliates, this affiliate information is owned entirely by the merchant. Merchants' use of affiliate data is governed by the merchants' contracts with the affiliates. Affiliates are always free to verify, alter, or delete the information recorded about them by updating their profiles through reporting.net, Be Free's affiliate interface. 

**Be Free ensures the security of merchant and affiliate data through passwords on all accounts**. These case-sensitive, alphanumeric passwords are stored on an encrypted database. Access to these passwords is limited to the merchants and affiliates who created the accounts, and to a handful of users within Be Free who require system level access in order to perform their jobs. We are always on the lookout for threats to data integrity or for ways to improve the security of our partners' data. We believe that the security of merchant and affiliate information is crucial to the services that we provide, and in that light we constantly reinforce the importance of data security with all employees. 

**Information gathered through Be Free's website is used only for the purposes expressed on the website and is shared with no outside parties**. All information gathered through the Be Free website is provided entirely on a voluntary basis, and resulting communications continue only so long as the outside party so desires. The "Merchants" contact information form and the "Stay in Touch" form allow interested parties to request more information about Be Free, and we use the contact information from those forms only to reach these interested parties. The site provides a number of e-mail addresses on the "Partners" page (Solutions Partners, Joint Marketing Partners, etc.) and on the "Contact Us" page (Sales, Careers, etc.). These e-mail addresses are provided so that visitors can send their inquiries directly to the people at Be Free best equipped to handle their questions. Be Free endeavors to respond to such inquiries as quickly as possible. The identity of the inquirers and the content of their messages is not shared with any outside parties. The "Rate this Site" form allows users to volunteer feedback about the site's design and content. This feedback is used solely to improve the appearance and functionality of our site. 

While we encourage merchants and affiliates to adopt a responsible approach to online marketing, Be Free is not responsible for any of the ways in which affiliates and merchant clients may collect data from their own websites. Merchants' and affiliates' privacy policies may differ from Be Free's policy. 

If Be Free changes any of these policies at some future date, the changes will be highlighted in a notice on this statement. 

**Spam**

**Be Free pledges never intentionally to send unsolicited e-mail messages that could legitimately be construed as spam. And we will educate and encourage our merchant clients to uphold the same standards.**

Mass e-mail programs, spidering bots that hunt out e-mail addresses, and commercial e-mail lists make indiscriminate mass solicitation easy and cheap. Be Free, however, believes that successful online marketing is created by understanding buyers and their interests, not by using mass e-mail programs that bother large numbers of uninterested parties. Consequently, Be Free has developed the following policies against the practice of spam. 

**Be Free policies regarding spam**

  * All e-mail sent by Be Free on behalf of our merchant clients must have an enclosed opt-out. 
  * Affiliate recruiting activities that include e-mail messaging must rely on opt-in methods. 
  * Be Free will advise its merchant clients that we believe spam is both inappropriate and ineffective. 
  * Be Free will recommend to all of its merchant clients that affiliates found to be sending spam be removed immediately from their sales channels.
