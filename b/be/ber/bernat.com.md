# Bernat: Privacy Policy

### Our Pledge

Bernat respects your privacy and pledges to earn and keep your trust. All personal information you give us is maintained in accordance with our privacy policy and will not be used in ways that are contrary to that policy. 

  


### Use of Information

Information collected by Bernat about its users is used internally by authorized employees of Bernat for three main purposes: First, we collect information to figure out which areas, features, and products our users like the most and find most helpful, so we can continue to improve the site. Second, we collect information in order to personalize the site for our users (for example, it allows us to know if you&#146;re a member or not). Finally, we collect information to enable our users to participate in sweepstakes, contests, services, and other activities on our site. 

  


### Cookies and IP Addresses

We do not and cannot use cookies or IP address tracking to retrieve personal information from your computer. To find out what cookies and IP addresses are, keep reading. 

### Cookies:

At times we send your computer a "cookie," a small piece of data that's stored in a file on your hard drive. We use cookies to give you better, more personalized service once you've become a member of Bernat. This information is for internal use only; we don't share it with others. You're always free to decline our cookies if your browser permits, but some parts of our site may not work properly for you if you do. 

  


### IP Address Tracking:

All computers and servers on the Internet use IP addresses to recognize and communicate with each other. Collecting IP addresses allows us to administer and analyze our site and report non-personal information (such as how many members we have). When you call up a Bernat page on your computer, Bernat servers enter the IP address of that computer into a log. 

  


### Online Contests

Sometimes we might require your name and e-mail address to participate in a contest. Because the rules and terms of each promotion can vary, all information about the contest is posted during the event, and those disclosures shall override anything to the contrary in this policy. 

  


### General security

Your personal information and your password are safe. We use the latest encryption technologies, rigorous password protections, and limits on the number of people who have access to your information, all to guard against unauthorized access to your data. 

  


### Reviewing and Changing Your Member Profile

As a member of Bernat, you can review and change the information in your Member Profile at any time. To do that, click the Membership link at the top of any page.

  


### Changes

Bernat may modify this privacy policy at any time, and such modifications shall be effective as soon as the modified policy is posted. Accordingly, you agree to review the policy periodically, and your continued access or use of this site shall be deemed your acceptance of the modified agreement. 

  


### Email

If you send us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may save your questions or comments for future reference. However, aside from our reply to such an email, it is not our standard practice to send you email unless you request a particular service that involves email communications. There may be times when you will have the opportunity to subscribe to an email list or electronic newsletter that will send information about our websites or our advertisers to your email address. However, we will provide you with the option to change your preferences and opt-out of receiving those communications. You may request at any time that we not email you in the future by clicking the "unsubscribe" link which is included at the bottom of any email that you receive from us. If you unsubscribe, we will make reasonable efforts to discontinue these email communications as soon as practicable.
