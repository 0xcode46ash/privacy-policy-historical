                     Berkeley College Internet Privacy Policy
Berkeley College understands that your privacy is important. We want you to know what
information may be collected through this site and how it may be used. Continued use of this
resource constitutes your agreement to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree,
please do not use the site.
What Personal Information May Be Collected
When you visit the Berkeley College website, our web server automatically receives and records
information on its server logs from your browser, including your computer operating system,
web browser, IP address, geo-location data, cookie information, and the pages you visit on the
site. We do not attempt to match or link such information to an individual’s personal
information.
In addition to the information that is recorded automatically, we also collect information that
you provide to us when you complete an online form or send us e-mail. Such information may
include your full name, address, phone number, email address or other personally identifiable
information. Berkeley College makes no representations concerning the reliability of
information collected by, displayed on, or transmitted from this website. Berkeley College
takes reasonable measures to protect the security of personal information collected in
accordance with prevailing industry standards. Furthermore, while we take reasonable
precautions to secure the information we gather through the site, any sharing of personal
information over the internet involves some security risk. Berkeley College does not warrant
that the information transmitted through or displayed on the site will not be accessed by
unauthorized individuals, or that it will be delivered free of viruses or other potentially harmful
material. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Berkeley College specifically disclaims any
warranties in connection with the use of this website including, but not limited to, warranties
of merchantability, non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose.

How We May Use or Disclose Personal Information
The information our web server automatically receives and records (such as your web browser,
IP address and cookie information) may be used to facilitate “re-marketing,” a practice through
which your visits to linked sites or advertisements may be shared with and used by our
affiliated companies or third party advertisers to send you additional communications in which
you may be interested. In addition, we may share information about you with employees of
Berkeley College and affiliated entities involved in activities to which it is relevant; with our
attorneys, accountants and other professionals; and with third parties who work with us in
developing and maintaining the site. We may also use that information for internal testing or
training purposes, to help us develop our website to better meet visitors' needs and
expectations, or to communicate with you for any purpose. Some information may be stored
subject to lengthy retention requirements.
Furthermore, Berkeley reserves the right to disclose personal information to law enforcement
officials, investigators, or other third parties as we deem necessary to prevent or address
abuses of the site including, but not limited to, violations of this Internet Privacy Policy, or when
such disclosure is required by law.
Occasionally, we may use certain information that we have collected to send you information
about programs, products or services offered by Berkeley College or other organizations that
we think may be of interest to you. However, Berkeley College does not sell or rent any
personal data submitted by visitors to any unrelated third parties.
Berkeley College respects the privacy of users visiting our site and will abide by all applicable
laws concerning the release of personal information. If you tell us that you do not wish to have
this information used as a basis for further contact with you, we will respect your wishes.
Please e-mail info@BerkeleyCollege.edu to request that your name be removed from our
mailing lists.
Online Tracking
Your internet browser may allow you to select a “Do Not Track” setting, which sends a signal to
websites that you do not want information about your internet activity to be collected or
tracked. Berkeley College does not respond to internet browser “Do Not Track” signals.

Links to Other Sites
This site may contain links to other sites operated by non-affiliated third parties. If you choose
to access such third-party sites, the operators of such sites may acquire access to your personal
information. You should be aware that Berkeley College does not control the information
privacy and security policies or practices of such unaffiliated third parties. Therefore, we
cannot be held responsible for either the content of such third-party sites or their use (or
abuse) of any information they receive from or about you.

Berkeley College may modify this Internet Privacy Policy at any time, without prior notice. If we
choose to do so, then the effective date of the change will be identified above the title of this
document as the “Last Modified” date. You will be deemed to have agreed to any such
modifications by your continued use of this site on or after the “Last Modified” date. We
