**How is my information used?**  
Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a customized experience. New England Newspapers Inc. uses information collected from server log files, such as IP addresses, to help diagnose problems with our services, to administer our web site, and to report and gather aggregate information about site usage and user demographics.
