# Privacy

We take the issue of data protection very seriously, and want to ensure that your privacy is always protected when using our pages. In the following Privacy Policy we will therefore explain how your data is handled.

## 1\. Access data without personal details

To improve our website offer we collect and store certain access data without personal details. When you request a file from our website, access data is collected and stored as a default.

These data include:

  * the page from which the file was requested,
  * the name of the file,
  * the date and time of the request,
  * the time spent on the page,
  * the amount of data transferred,
  * the access status (i.e. if the file was transferred or not found etc.),
  * the IP address of the requesting computer,
  * a description of the type and version of the web browser used,
  * the installed operating system and the resolution set.



These data is analysed for internal statistical purposes, as well as for technical administration of the website; they are not transferred to third parties in whole or in part. These anonymous data is stored separate from personal data, and in no case connected to your personal details, meaning that no connection to a specific person is possible.

## 2\. Collection and storage of personal data

Personal data is only collected if you voluntarily share them with us. The following personal data is mainly collected as part of your order or when opening a customer account: Title, name, address, email address, telephone number. Payment information such as bank details or credit card number are also collected as part of an order.

The personal data disclosed (title, name, address, email address, telephone number, bank details, credit card number) are stored lawfully and in accordance with the provisions of the Federal German Data Protection Act (BDSG) and the Telemedia Act (TMG). Your data is always treated confidentially.

## 3\. Usage of personal data

Your personal data will only be used for order processing unless you give separate consent for further usage. However, for delivery of the goods transfer of your address details to a parcel service is required. They are obligated to treat your details as confidential, and only use them for the purposes of the delivery. For payment processing your payment details will be transferred to the credit institute we appoint. There will be no other transfer of your personal customer data to third parties. However we are authorised, on a case-by-case basis, to provide the authorities with your details if they request the data as part of their legal powers (e.g. criminal prosecution).

We do not use the collected data for the purposes of advertising or market/opinion research without your consent.

## 4\. Newsletter

When registering for our newsletter you agree to us using your email address for our own advertising purposes. You can at any time, with future effect, revoke your consent to the storage and usage of your email address for distribution of the newsletter, e.g. by sending an email to: [service@bergfreunde.eu](https://www.bergfreunde.eu/contact/) or by unsubscribing from the newsletter.

## 5\. Cookies

The sales page uses cookies to make usage of the website easier. Cookies are small text files that your internet browser saves on your computer. If you open the corresponding page again the cookies make it possible to recognise your computer. This means, for example, that you only need to enter the details entered on an order form once. In general we use cookies that are automatically deleted from your hard drive after closure of the internet browser (so-called "session cookies"). Other cookies remain on your computer and mean that your computer can be recognised when you visit again (so-called "persistent cookies"). You can at any time change your cookie storage settings by going to your browser settings and selecting the option "do not accept cookies". However we would like to point out that this will mean that you may not be able to use all the features of our website.

  * Deltavista GmbH, Diefenbachgasse 35, A-1150 Vienna, Austria
  * Deltavista GmbH, Freisinger Landstraße 74, D-80939 Munich, Germany
  * SCHUFA Holding AG, Kormoranweg 5, D-65201 Wiesbaden, Germany

The credit check may include a probability value (score) that is calculated on the basis of a scientifically proven mathematical statistical process, and for which the address details are used. Your legitimate interests are considered in accordance with the legal provisions. You may at any time revoke this review with future effect. However this may mean that we cannot offer you certain payment options.

## 8\. Data security

Because the security of your data is important to us, we transmit your personal data via a secure SSL connection. If personal details are collected then the transmission of data is encrypted using an SSL process. Your personal details are then transmitted via the internet with at least 256-bit SSL. The SSL encryption protects your personal data from third-party access. SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is a protocol for the encryption of messages on the internet, which offers particularly high levels of security.

We also secure our website and other systems with technical and organisational measures to prevent loss, deletion, access, alteration or dissemination of your data by unauthorised persons. Despite regular inspections a total protection against danger is nevertheless not possible.

## 9\. Web analysis & retargeting

### 9.1 Google Analytics

This website uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google"). Google Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your computer, to help the website analyse how you use the site.

The information generated by the cookie about your use of the website will generally be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the USA. If IP anonymisation is activated on this website then your IP address will first be truncated by Google within a member state of the European Union or within another contracting state to the agreement on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases will your full IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and truncated there. Please note that this website uses Google Analytics with the "_anonymizeIp()" extension and the IP address is therefore only processed in a truncated form, meaning that personal identification is prevented.

On behalf of the operator of this website, Google will use this information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the website, compiling reports on website activity for website operators and providing other services relating to website activity and internet usage to the website operator. The IP address transmitted by your browser to Google Analytics will not be connected with other Google data. You can refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings in your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website.

You can furthermore prevent the collection by Google of the data provided by the cookie and related to your usage of the website (including the IP address), as well as the processing of this data by Google by downloading and installing the browser plugin available via the following link: http://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=de.

More information about the terms of use and privacy can be found at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/de.html and https://www.google.de/intl/de/policies/. Please note that on this website Google Analytics is expanded with the code "gat._anonymizeIp();" to guarantee an anonymised collection of your IP address (so-called IP masking).

### 9.2. Using the Google Inc. Remarketing feature

We use the "Remarketing" feature offered by Google Inc., 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, US ("Google") on our website. This feature allows us to readdress users who have visited our website in a targeted way through pinpointed advertising on Google's Partner Network pages. Personalised, interest-based advertisements can then be displayed on other websites that the user may visit within the Google Display Network. Cookies are used to display these advertisements. Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's computer. These text files help to collect anonymised data about the use of the website, which cannot be traced back to an individual.

You can permanently disable Google's use of cookies by clicking on the following link and downloading and installing the available plugin: https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin. Alternatively, you can disable the use of cookies by third-party providers by accessing the Network Advertising Initiative's deactivation page at http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/ and following the more detailed information provided there about opting out.

You can find information about the type, scope and purpose of the collection, usage and further processing or usage of the data by Google, as well as your rights and settings options for protection of user privacy in Google's privacy terms at http://www.google.com/privacy/ads/.

### 9.3. Retargeting

In a similar way to Google Analytics, this website collects data by the following services:

  * Criteo, a web analysis service of Criteo SA, 32 Rue Blanche, 75009 Paris, France.
  * Sociomantic, a web analysis service of sociomantic labs GmbH, Münzstrasse 19, 10178 Berlin, Germany.



The data collected and stored by these web analysis services are always compiled using pseudonym usage profiles. These web analysis services analyse the surfing behaviour based on an algorithm, and can then provide targeted product recommendations as personalised advertising banners on other websites (so-called publishers). The data is never used to personally identify the users of this website. The collection and storage of data by these services for the purposes of web analysis can at any time be objected to with future effect by following the instructions on the following websites:

  * Criteo: http://www.criteo.com/de/datenschutzrichtlinie
  * Sociomantic: https://www.sociomantic.com/privacy/de/#opt-out-header



### 9.4. Storm Reporting (DC Storm)

This website uses Storm Reporting, a web analysis software of DC Storm Ltd. (DC Storm). Storm Reporting uses "cookies". These are small text files that are stored on your computer to collect anonymised information about your visit to our website.

The information stored includes:

  * A randomly generated unique identifier that can recognise repeat visits by the same user.
  * Page, session and visit counters to record the visit duration and number of pages that the visitor viewed.
  * Where available, the URL (referrer) of the page that the visitor used to reach the website. This is disguised as a hash algorithm in the cookie. For example "http://www.google.com/search?q=dcstorm" could be coded as "12345678|560868". This serves to prevent duplication of new users. This cookie expires 20 minutes after its creation.



The IP address of the website user is not stored by DC Storm. For technical reasons it is transferred by every server request, but anonymised before any processing (e.g. geolocalisation) and then deleted. This means that no IP address or other connections can be made to the user.

The collected and anonymised data is sent to a DC Storm server in Great Britain and stored there. Transfer to and/or processing of data outside the territory of the European Community states does not occur. DC Storm will only transfer this information to third parties if it is legally required.

By using this website you agree that website data can be collected and anonymously stored in the aforementioned form.

We take your privacy seriously and will not transfer the collected data to third parties. The collected data is only used to analyse and optimise our website.

You may stop your browser from saving cookies. However, we point out that this may limit usage of the website and you may not be able to use all the functions completely. You can object to data collection and storage by DC Storm on the website dc-storm.de:

object to data collection by DC Storm on Bergfreunde.eu.

The objection is saved in a special cookie (_#uid) and is valid indefinitely, as long as the cookie is not deleted.

## 10\. Facebook/Twitter Social Plugins

Our website integrates social plugins (programmes) from the external social networks Facebook and Twitter.

### 10.1. Facebook

From Facebook we use the "like" button, the "share" button and the "social plugin". These plugins are operated by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. They can be recognised by the corresponding Facebook logo. More information about the Facebook social plugins can be found at http://developers.facebook.com/plugins.

If a visitor opens a page of our website that contains this type of plugin, a connection is created between the browser of the visitor and the Facebook servers. Facebook receives and stores data (including IP address and cookie ID) that allows Facebook to recognise which page of our website the visitor opened. This occurs regardless of whether a Facebook plugin is interacted with or not. If the visitor interacts with a Facebook plugin or leaves a comment, then the corresponding information will be transferred to Facebook in the US and stored there. If the visitor is logged in to Facebook when this occurs, then the forwarded data can be assigned to a specific account. To do so, Facebook uses cookies for both registered and non-registered users.

The type, scope and purpose of the collection, usage and other processing or usage of the data by Facebook, as well as your rights and setting options for protection of user privacy can be found in the Facebook Privacy Policy (https://www.facebook.com/about/privacy) and adjusted. Beyond the above, the precise data processing operations, storage periods and purposes are unclear.

This website uses the communication tool "Conversion Tracking Pixel" by Facebook Inc., 1601 S. California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA ("Facebook"). We integrate so-called Facebook pixels in our page for that purpose. Once you have viewed or clicked a Facebook ad, you will be tagged as a visitor of our website and we will be able to follow your activities on our website. The captured data is anonymous, i.e. we will be unable to view personal data of individual users and specifically cannot connect activities on our website to any individual; we will only be able to analyse the Facebook ads for statistical and/or market research purposes. The captured data will, however, be stored and processed by Facebook and may be brought into connection with your Facebook profile. Facebook is then entitled to utilise that information in compliance with the Facebook Data Policy (https//www.facebook.com/about/privacy). You have the option of permitting or refusing Facebook and its partners to display adverts on and outside of Facebook as part of your personal profile settings on Facebook.

You can refuse the use of the Conversion Tracking Pixel on your Facebook profile here: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=ads

### 10.2. Twitter

We use the Twitter button by Twitter. This plugin is operated by Twitter Inc., 795 Folsom St., Suite 600, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. It can be recognised by the corresponding Twitter logo. More information about the Twitter social plugins can be found at http://twitter.com/about/resources.

When a visitor opens a page of our website that contains such a plugin, a connection is created between the visitor's browser and the Twitter servers. Twitter receives and stores data (including the IP address) that allows Twitter to recognise which page of our website the visitor has opened. This occurs regardless of whether the Twitter plugin is interacted with or not. If the visitor interacts with a Twitter plugin the corresponding information is transferred to Twitter in the US and stored there. If the visitor is logged in to their personal Twitter account when this occurs, then the forwarded data can be assigned to a specific account.

Art, Umfang, Zwecke der Erhebung, Verwendung sowie die weitere Verarbeitung und Nutzung der Daten durch Twitter sowie die Rechte und Einstellungsmöglichkeiten zum Schutz der Privatsphäre des Nutzers, können in den Datenschutzhinweisen von Twitter (http://twitter.com/privacy) nachgelesen und angepasst werden.
