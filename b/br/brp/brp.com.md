# Privacy Policy | BRP USA

**Scope**  
This Privacy Policy applies to information, including personal information, collected about you by BRP (Bombardier Recreational Products Inc. and its affiliated companies and subsidiaries).

BRP is committed to protecting your privacy, and supports a general policy of openness about how we collect, use and disclose your personal information.

 **Purpose**  
The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you about BRP’s practices relating to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information that may be provided through access to or use of our websites or services and related products or that may otherwise be collected by us. By purchasing our products or using our services or website, you consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information (as defined below) in accordance with the following terms and conditions.

This Privacy Policy also explains how you can contact us if you have a question about, want to make a change to or delete any personal information that BRP may be holding about you. We strongly recommend that you take the time to read this Privacy Policy and retain it for future reference.

 **Personal Information**  
For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, “personal information” means information about an identifiable individual.

 **What Personal Information We Collect**  
The personal information collected may include at least some of the following:

  * Contact information (such as name, address, e-mail address and telephone number in a non-business capacity); and
  * Demographic information (such as gender and communication language).



 **How We Use Your Personal Information**  
We use your personal information to:

  * Provide you with personalized services and interactive communication;
  * Do all the things necessary to administer those services;
  * Research, develop, manage, protect and improve those services;
  * Advise you about new products and services that may be of interest to you; and
  * Develop and maintain our relationship with you and communicate with you.



 **When We Disclose Your Personal Information**  
Except with your consent, we will not sell, license, trade or rent your personal information to or with others.

BRP may share personal information with third parties engaged to assist us in providing services to you or to carry out one or more of the purposes described above. These service providers are prohibited from using your personal information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance and are required to protect personal information disclosed by BRP and to comply with the general privacy principles described in this Privacy Policy.

BRP reserves the right to disclose personal information to a third party if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally requires or authorizes us to do so.

BRP also reserves the right to disclose and/or transfer personal information to a third party in the event of a proposed or actual purchase, sale (including a liquidation, realization, foreclosure or repossession), lease, merger, amalgamation or any other type of acquisition, disposal, transfer, conveyance or financing of all or any portion of BRP or of any of the business or assets or shares of BRP or a division thereof in order for you to continue to receive the same products and services from the third party.

 **Knowledge and Consent**  
BRP collects personal information about you only when you voluntarily provide it. Typically, we will seek consent for the use or disclosure of your personal information at the time of collection. In certain circumstances, consent may be sought after the information has been collected but before use (for example, when we want to use information for a purpose not previously identified).

The form of consent that we seek, including whether it is express or implied, will largely depend on the sensitivity of the personal information and the reasonable expectations of the individual in the circumstances.

You may withdraw consent at any time, subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable Policy. If you wish to withdraw your consent at any time, please contact **BRP at[privacyofficer@brp.com](mailto:privacyofficer@brp.com) or by mail at Bombardier Recreational Products Inc., Attention: Senior Legal Counsel-Privacy Offer, 726, St-Joseph, Valcourt, Quebec, Canada, J0E 2L0**. We will inform you of the implications of withdrawing consent.

We will not, as a condition of the supply of a product or service, require you to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of information beyond that required to fulfill the explicitly specified and legitimate purposes for which the information is being provided.

 **Use or Disclosure for Marketing Purposes**  
Unless you have requested not to receive any marketing materials, we may also use (but will not disclose) your personal information to promote and market additional goods, services and special offers from us, our affiliates and/or our business associates including by means of direct marketing. We may also disclose your name and mailing address to these affiliates and/or business associates so that they can send you promotional materials directly.
