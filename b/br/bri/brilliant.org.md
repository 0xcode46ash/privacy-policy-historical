# Privacy Policy | Brilliant

Brilliant Worldwide, Inc. ("Brilliant") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Statement. By using the brilliant.org website, or any of our mobile applications (such as are available via the App Store and Google Play Store), and any related services and/or features (collectively, the "Service") you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.

### What Does This Privacy Statement Cover?

This Privacy Statement covers Brilliant's treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") that Brilliant gathers when you access/use the Service.

### What Personal Information Does Brilliant Collect?

Brilliant collects information you voluntarily submit to the Service, such as, the information we collect when you register for an account: your name, email address, school, date of birth, etc. 

Information you elect to submit to the Service in a public or quasi-public manner may be disclosed to other users of the Application or the general public ("User Submission(s)"). For example - if you make a post to a message board or chat forum that includes any personal information – such information will be made publicly available. We endeavor to make sure the Service's functionality puts you on reasonable notice as to the scope of an intended submission.

In addition, we may automatically receive and store certain, anonymous types of information whenever you interact with the Service. Such information may include the user's IP address, domain server, and type of Internet browser. This information helps us, among other things, analyze trends and administer the Service. This information is anonymous and contains no personally identifiable data.

### What about children?

The safety and privacy of children is extremely important to us. Every Service member must be over 13 years of age. Minors younger than 13 are prohibited from signing up or using the Service in any way. If you receive information that a member is under 13, we require the member to provide evidence of being over 13. If such evidence is not provided in a timely manner, we terminate the user's account and nullify all personally identifiable information displaying on the site and collected from such user.

### How does Brilliant use the information it collects?

  * Provide the Service: Your information will be used primarily to provide you with the Service.
  * Improve the Service: Your information may be used by us internally to improve the Service and develop new products, services and features.
  * Other Uses: Your information may also be used by us as set forth in the next section.



### Will Brilliant Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives?

To the limited extent we collect Personal Information – we neither rent nor sell your Personal Information to anyone. We share your Personal Information only as described below.

_Foundations:_ Brilliant may disclose your name, contact info, school, and aggregate information about your ability level to educational foundations that are working with Brilliant so such foundations can identify talented individuals, award scholarships and/or grants, and provide mentorship.

_Recipient of User Submissions:_ As mentioned above – your User Submissions may be shared in a public or quasi-public manner.

_Service Providers and Agents:_ We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf. For example, we may decide to use a third party payment processing company to process payments you make through the Service. In addition, parts of the Service may be hosted by a third party on our behalf. Your information may be accessed by such providers/agents, in the event that we need to share your information with them to provide our services or customer support to you. Unless we tell you differently, Brilliant's agents do not have any right to use Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us.

_Business Transfers:_ In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if Brilliant, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Brilliant goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, customer information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Brilliant may continue to use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

_Protection of Brilliant and Others:_ We may release Personal Information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Brilliant, our employees, our users, or others.

_With Your Consent:_ Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your Personal Information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.
