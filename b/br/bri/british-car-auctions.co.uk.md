# Privacy Policy

## Data Protection Act 1998

British Car Auctions Limited (‘BCA’) respects and values the security and privacy of its customers. BCA follows strict security procedures in the storage and disclosure of personal information in order to prevent unauthorised access. Personal Data is held on our databases either because of services we have provided to you or because we believe that customers may be interested in receiving material from us about our business and services. As such we hold customer contact details and the history of our customer relationship. This allows us to manage our customer relationships effectively and target items of interest so that you do not receive unwanted material through the post.

In accordance with your rights under the Act, you may request the amendment of the personal information held or to cease receiving direct marketing materials. Information may, in the ordinary course of business, move between BCA, its associated companies and to our contractors, which may involve the transfer of data outside the European Economic Area.

From time to time we may provide your information to our customer service agencies for research and analysis purposes so that we can monitor and improve the services we provide. We or our agents and sub-contractors may contact you by post, e-mail or telephone to ask you for your feedback and comments on our services. We and our associated companies may also wish to provide you with information about special features of our website or any other service or products which we think may be of interest to you.
