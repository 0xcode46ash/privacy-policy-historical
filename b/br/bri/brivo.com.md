  * Activity and event data (including video) that is automatically collected by Brivo’s services in our role as a data processor.

Collectively this is considered “Account Data”. 

**COLLECTION AND USE OF ACCOUNT DATA**

As a Data Processor, we collect and process all Account Data strictly on behalf of our Subscribers and Partners in accordance with our contractual agreements with them and/or as defined in our product Terms of Use and/or as required or permitted by law. Personal information entered or captured by our systems on behalf of our Subscribers or Partners regarding their employees, visitors or other parties (Data Subjects) is considered Account Data.

Our Subscribers and Partners are responsible as Data Controllers for ensuring (i) their Data Subjects receive proper notice of the Data Controllers’ privacy practices, and that (ii) Account Data is obtained in accordance with all applicable laws. Since Account Data is managed by the Data Controllers, the Data Controller is responsible for providing appropriate notice and choice to its Data Subjects regarding our processing of Account Data on its behalf. If a Data Subject has any questions or concerns related to our handling of their data, the Data Subject may contact our Data Protection Officer via privacy@brivo.com and we will work with the Subscriber and/or Partner to address the concern.

From Partners, Brivo collects the personal information that is needed to properly manage our business relationship. Brivo Partners will receive login credentials to manage Subscriber accounts. Partners are able to create a new account for each Subscriber by providing Account Name, Reference Numbers, Username, and Email address. We only collect this information for the purposes of allowing you to manage your Subscriber accounts and for conducting business with Brivo.

 **Types of Account Data Collected related to Brivo Onair Services**

Brivo collects information for the purposes of providing Brivo Onair services. We collect information in the following ways:

  *  **Information provided by Subscribers:** Brivo Onair provides the capability for Subscribers to store basic personal information such as an individual’s name, credential number, email address, phone number  and photograph. This information is used to correlate security events to the correct individual, as well as to enable notifications and Brivo Onair Pass functionality. Though the system has the capability to store a number of personal data elements, these items are not essential for operation of the system.


  *  **Information generated from events:** Brivo Onair collects access control and video event data. For example, Brivo Onair records that an access card was used at a particular door at a certain time. This event may also be recorded on video, if that service is active. Through correlation with the information our Subscribers provide, we can tie that access event and video to a particular individual’s credential.
  *  **Log Information:** Brivo Onair records the actions of system Administrators, as well as the status and the settings of various devices that have been configured to operate with Brivo Onair.  Log information is used by the Data Controller to review the activity of Administrators.
  *  **Mobile Applications:** Brivo provides mobile applications which can optionally be used with Brivo Onair. The Brivo Onair Mobile App (BOMA) provides administrative access to the system under the same conditions as using a web-browser. Brivo Onair Pass (BOP) is a form of digital credential used for physical access to a building. We collect information about the location of the device and information about Brivo Tri-Tech readers within Bluetooth range of the application to simplify connectivity to open the door.  In order to provide these services Brivo collects various types of device, WiFi access point data and Bluetooth data. In order to use these services various features such as location services, WiFi and Bluetooth communication will need to be activated on your mobile device.
  *  **Third Parties:** Brivo shares data with relevant third party processors when explicitly authorized by Administrators in the relevant Brivo Onair account; for example, to enable integrations via our Application Programming Interface (API).



 **Account Data may be used by Brivo to:**

  * Enable event notifications and Brivo Onair Pass functionality.
  * Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements that we think may be of interest to you.
  * Provide important service notices regarding the Brivo Onair application and related devices.  While you use Brivo services, it will not be possible to opt out of communications regarding service notices.
  * Ask you to participate in surveys that help us better understand your needs in order to improve our products.



 **Roles of Customers, Partners and Brivo in Protection of Brivo Onair Account Data**

Brivo provides products to end customers via its authorized Partner channel. Brivo’s Partners handle the initial setup and configuration of the Brivo applications, services and hardware (collectively, the Brivo System). Customers can choose what data to share with the Partner and/or Brivo during the set-up process. After initial set-up, access to the Brivo System is limited to authorized Administrators.

Customers are responsible to verify that all Administrators of the Brivo System are authorized by them for the levels of access granted. In general, the customer should be the master Administrator for their Brivo System.  In the event that the customer chooses to permit the Brivo Partner to have administrative rights to the Brivo System, the Customer is responsible for monitoring the Partner’s access to Account Data.

Brivo employees have access to Account Data solely to provide our services and in response to specific customer and Partner requests for technical support. Brivo will access Customer Data only for the purposes of providing the Services, preventing or addressing service or technical problems, or as may be required by law. 

**Brivo GDPR Compliance Statement**

 **Background:**

The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection regime that becomes effective on May 25th, 2018. The GDPR extends the scope of the EU data protection law to all foreign companies processing data of EU residents.

The GDPR provides for a harmonization of the data protection regulations throughout the EU, thereby making it easier for companies to comply with these regulations; however, this comes at the cost of a strict data protection compliance regime.

 **Brivo’s Position:**

At Brivo, privacy and security are core elements of our service. Accordingly, we are always conscious and respectful of the privacy and confidentiality of individuals who visit Brivo’s websites, use our services, develop applications using Brivo’s APIs and resell Brivo’s products.

Brivo maintains a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry standard, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data. Brivo does not share, sell, rent or trade personally identifiable information with third parties.

Brivo has the distinction of being one of the first building security platforms to be SOC 2 audited and being the first physical security software-as-a-service (SaaS) company to utilize the SSAE 16/18 framework to provide security review. Brivo undertakes an independent third party annual SOC 2, Type 1 audit that reviews certain of its internal controls and processes.  We recognize that the GDPR will help us move towards the highest standards of operations in protecting customer data.

Brivo is able to execute strong Data Processing Agreements based on the EU standard contractual clauses in accordance with Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC to meet the requirements of the GDPR.

 **Application of the GDPR for Brivo:**

In the context of the GDPR, individuals with data stored in Brivo Onair or individuals using Brivo applications are considered Data Subjects. Brivo end-users and in some cases Brivo Resellers are considered Data Controllers. Brivo is a Data Processor.

In Brivo’s role as a Data Processor, we are the responsible custodian of the Data Subject’s data, performing this role on behalf of the Data Controller. The Data Controller is completely responsible to determine what data is captured, stored and processed within our application. The Data Controller is the owner of the data. Brivo does does not rent, share, disclose or sell any data owned by the Data Controller.

Within our service model, most Data Subjects will have limited direct interaction with the Brivo application that captures and stores their data. This interaction will primarily be via the Brivo Onair Pass application. Most Data Subjects will be employees, visitors or contractors of the Data Controller. Data is captured based on their relationship with the Data Controller. The Data Controller is responsible for gaining explicit consent from the Data Subject regarding the data to be stored. Data Subject requests to purge data from Brivo subject to Brivo’s SLA with the Data Controller will be adjudicated by the Data Controller.

The GDPR includes provisions that grant Data Subjects portability rights in their personal data. Any personal data we store on behalf of Data Controllers belongs to the Data Subject. We will coordinate with Data Subjects and, as applicable Data Controllers, when requested to delete or port data. We provide for portability and are continually working to enhance our data export capabilities.

 **Summary**

Privacy and security are core elements of Brivo’s services, so we are committed to the spirit and intent of the GDPR.  While we have a solid data protection foundation in place, we recognize the need to make additional required operational changes resulting from the new legislation.

We have an internal cross-functional team who continue to monitor GDPR as it evolves, and who will continue to inform our strategy for GDPR. We will continue to monitor the GDPR and evolve our systems and processes to ensure continued compliance.

Brivo is liable for appropriate onward transfers of personal data to third parties.

 **Data Location & Transfer of Information**

Brivo stores all Account Data in the continental United States. To facilitate our Subscribers’ global operations, Brivo transfers information to the United States and provides access to that information to Subscribers around the world.
