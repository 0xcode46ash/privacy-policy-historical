Brivo OnAir (acs.brivo.com) is our application for delivering physical security management services using the Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Brivo OnAir uses a common interface to control and display elements related to physical access control, ID badging and video surveillance.

  2. **Roles of Participants in Information Management**



Brivo provides products to Subscribers via its authorized Dealer channel. Brivo’s Dealers handle the initial set-up and configuration of the OnAir application and hardware. Subscribers can choose what data to share with the Dealer during the set-up process. After initial set-up, access to the Subscribers Brivo OnAir account is limited to authorized Administrators. Brivo employees have access to Subscriber data solely to provide our services and in response to specific customer requests for technical support.

  3. **Collection and Use of Information**



From Visitors to our websites, Brivo collects only the personal information necessary to enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services. When you visit our website, you may be asked to identify your product needs or the business category of your company, as well as your e-mail address, company name, business address and phone number, information that will better enable us to respond to your requests. If you wish to subscribe to news and information, we will use your address information for this purpose. We will provide you a way to modify your communication preferences and to unsubscribe.

As Visitors navigate Brivo’s websites, we may also collect information through the use of commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons (“Web Site Navigational Information”). Web Site Navigational Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type and browser language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on our websites, such as the pages viewed and the links clicked. The information we collect from our websites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our websites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.

From Subscribers, Brivo collects information (Customer Data) for the purpose of providing our services. We collect information in the following ways:

  * **Information provided by Subscribers:** Brivo OnAir provides the capability for Subscribers to store basic personal information such as an individual’s name, email address and photograph. This information is used to correlate security events to the correct individual, as well as to enable notifications and Brivo Mobile Pass functionality. Though the system has the capability to store a number of personal data elements, these items are not essential for operation of the system.


  * **Information generated from events:** Brivo OnAir collects access control and video event data. For example, Brivo OnAir records that an access card was used at a particular door at a certain time. This event may also be recorded on video, if that service is active. Through correlation with the information our Subscribers provide, we can tie that access event and video to a particular individual’s credential.


  * **Log Information:** Brivo OnAir records the actions of system Administrators, as well as the status and the settings of various devices that have been configured to operate with Brivo OnAir. Customer Data entered in Brivo OnAir by Subscribers or collected through the operation of the system are for the exclusive use of our Subscribers. Brivo may access Customer Data only for the purpose of providing the Services or preventing or addressing service or technical problems or as may be required by law.



Brivo does not sell, rent or trade personally identifiable customer information with third parties.

Brivo shares data with relevant third party processors when explicitly authorized by administrators in the relevant Brivo OnAir account; for example, to enable integrations via our Application Programming Interface (API).

Customer Data may also used by Brivo to:

  * Enable event notifications and Brivo Mobile Pass functionality.
  * Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements that we think may be of interest to you.
  * Provide important service notices regarding the Brivo OnAir application and related devices.
  * Ask you to participate in surveys that help us better understand your needs in order to improve our products.



From Dealers, Brivo collects the personal information that is needed to properly manage our business relationship. Brivo Dealers will receive login credentials to manage Subscriber accounts. Dealers are able to create a new account for each subscriber by providing Account Name, Reference Numbers, Username, and Email address. We only collect this information for the purpose of allowing you to manage your subscriber accounts and for the purposes stated above.

  4. **Data Location & Transfer of Information**



Brivo stores all Customer Data in the continental United States. To facilitate our Subscribers’ global operations, Brivo transfers information to the United States and provides access to that information to Subscribers around the world.

  5. **Data Safeguards**



The security of Customer Data, including personal data, is very important to Brivo. Brivo maintains a comprehensive, written information security program that contains industry standard, administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access to Customer Data. Brivo OnAir is capable of safeguarding Personally Identifiable Information (PII), in accordance with NIST SP 800-122 and OMB memos M-06-16 and M-07-16 with specific provisions enabled by the Subscriber.
