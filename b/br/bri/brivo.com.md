As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we do collect from our Web sites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our Web sites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.

## Cookies

Except as stated herein, Brivo will not disclose any security information (e.g., user access data) to any third parties unless directed to do so by you, or unless we receive your explicit prior permission.

## How Secure is Your Information?

Additionally, the hosting facility is guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, card access and locked cage areas, as well as security camera surveillance.

Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service except in the following limited circumstances:
