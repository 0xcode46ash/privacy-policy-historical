## What Information is Collected and How will it be Used?

From visitors, Brivo collects only the personal information necessary to enable us to respond to your requests for our products and services. When you visit our website, you may be asked to identify your product needs or the business category of your company, as well as your email address, company name, business address and phone number, information that will better enable us to respond to your requests.

From our customers, we collect only the information that is needed to properly serve you and administer our business. This includes both personal and business information. Brivo may use your personal and business information to:

  * Provide you with educational material when you request a demo, related to our services and recommendations regarding security practices.
  * Contact you to inform you of product and service enhancements and to offer Brivo-related promotions or discounts that we think may be of interest to you.
  * Notify you of any regulatory or compliance issues that will affect your ACS service.
  * Ask you to participate in surveys that help us better understand your needs in order to improve our products.



Once you have decided to join Brivo we will then provide you with login credentials so that you may manage your accounts. You will be able to create a new account for each of your clients, you will be asked for an Account Name, Reference Numbers, Name, Username, and Email address. We only collect this information for the purpose of allowing you to set up your client accounts. We do not use your clients' information for any other purpose. If your clients wish to update or correct inaccuracies within their information you may update this information for them within the platform.

We do not have any access or control over the Customer Login section of the site. All information collected within that section of the site is not governed by our privacy policy.

## Newsletters

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the “Choice and Opt-out” section.

## Passive Collection of Information

Our Web server automatically recognizes your domain name, but not your email address. As stated above, we do not collect nonpublic personal information from visitors to our sites unless you expressly provide it to us. The information we do collect from our websites (such as domain name, number of hits, pages visited, and length of user session) may be combined to analyze how our websites are used. This information is then used to improve the usefulness of the sites.

## Cookies                                                                     

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. 

We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site, to prevent duplicates in the email newsletter signup process, and to hold error messages when users fill out the request demo forms. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. Persistent cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” file.

## Third Party Cookies

The use of cookies by third parties on our site is not covered by our privacy statement. We do not have access or control over these cookies. These third parties use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.

## Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)

Our third party advertising partner employs a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.

## Third Party Products

Brivo does not share, sell, rent, or trade PII with third parties other than as disclosed within this privacy policy.

Brivo actively may, on occasion, use your contact information to let you know about special offers that may be of interest to you. You may contact us at any time in order to change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo by emailing us at [marketing@brivo.com](mailto:marketing@brivo.com).

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our website.

Except as stated herein, Brivo will not disclose any security information (e.g., user access data) to any third parties unless directed to do so by you, or unless we receive your explicit prior permission.

## How Secure is Your Information?

Brivo uses a variety of security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of information that it collects. Every Brivo employee is trained on our privacy and security procedures. Only authorized Brivo employees or its representatives are permitted access to your business information. Moreover, Brivo uses industry-standard technical safeguards and security measures to safeguard the confidentiality of the information in its possession, such as firewalls and Secure Socket Layers ("SSL"). Information collected by Brivo is stored on secured servers, co-located at a third party's secure facilities. Additionally, the hosting facility is guarded by 24 X 7 security guards, card access and locked cage areas, as well as security camera surveillance.

Except as specifically stated herein, Brivo will not access security information entered by you in the course of using Brivo's ACS Service except in the following limited circumstances:

  * To provide necessary technical support, usually at your request and with your permission;
  * To produce regular backups, restore data from backups at your request or install software updates and/or upgrades.



## Deleting or Updating Information

Brivo encourages you to contact us if you wish to delete, correct or update your business information in our systems, or if you desire to change your preferences with respect to marketing contacts from Brivo by emailing us at [marketing@brivo.com](mailto:marketing@brivo.com). We will respond to your request to access within 30 business days.

## Choice/Opt-out

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or by emailing us at [marketing@brivo.com](mailto:marketing@brivo.com).

## Agents/Service Providers 

We use other third parties such as an email service provider to provide broadcast email services for us, and a survey tool provider that enables us to solicit feedback on our products and services. 

When you request demonstrations or subscribe to our newsletters, we will use your name, company name, and email as necessary for the third party to provide that service. 

These third parties are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for promotional purposes.

## Changes in this Privacy Statement

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the home page, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or by means of a notice on our home page.
