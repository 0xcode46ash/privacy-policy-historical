**Our Approach to Privacy**

Your privacy and the privacy of all registered users of the services of BrightTALK, is important to us. We understand your need for privacy when using the Web for your communications and we have developed our Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to privacy. 

The following provides an overview of how we protect your privacy. ****

**Information Collected**

In connection with your use of our site, we ask for and may collect a variety of information from and about you in different ways. Information on BrightTALK is gathered indirectly through the site's technology and directly when you provide information on various pages. 

**Indirect Information**

For example, indirect information is gathered through our Internet access logs, including: Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), platform type, and date/time stamp. 

**Direct Information**

Direct Information is collected in a variety of ways including the use of cookies, system tests and through voluntary submission. 

**Cookies**

Our website uses cookies to keep track of your session identity and to provide you with a better service. A cookie is a unique piece of data that is generated by a website that is stored on your computer. Each time you access that website the contents of that cookie are sent back to the website. This means that the web server can be aware that you have visited before and that you are returning, or perhaps loading up another page on the same site. A cookie may collect information about, for example, how you entered the site, how you navigate through it, and what information was of interest to you. 

The cookies we use identify you as a number and cannot, by themselves, reveal any personal details about you or your computer's setup. Cookies do not contain executable code and cannot be used for infecting your computer with a virus. 

You have the option of configuring your browser to accept all cookies, reject all cookies or notify you when a cookie is sent. You can change your settings in the preferences or options menu of your browser. 

**System tests**

Our website can carry out a system test on your computer if you request it, or if you select the Contact Customer Support page. Our system test will make an enquiry to your computer to determine your browser settings, operating system, media players, screen resolution, sound card capability and current bandwidth available. 

The system test that we carry out does not reveal any personal details about you. 

**Voluntary submission**

We also collect information when you voluntarily submit it to us. Throughout our site, we provide the opportunity to register for an event or conference, to book a service, or to participate in an online survey. For example, when you register to use our site, we ask for and store your and/or your business' name, address, email address and other identifying contact data. We may also receive information about you through the websites of the companies for which we provide services. 

When we collect this type of information we will make it clear why we are asking for this information and how it will be used. It is up to you whether or not you wish to provide it. 

**Use of Information**

Personally identifiable information may be combined with other information about your use of our site in order to improve our services and products. Some examples of how we might use your personally identifiable information include: 

  * Our server will recognise your domain name and the pages that you visit. This data is gathered for quality control and to help us improve the site. 
  * When an email is sent to us we will use your email address to respond to you. 
  * We will collect information that you provide to us in surveys or feedback forms. We will use that information to improve the running of our own business and may aggregate it with other responses to provide as abstracted information in a report, not specific to any individual or company. 
  * When contacting customer support we request your contact details and your system details (entered automatically) to help our technical staff to provide you with a speedy response to your question. 
  * We may use your contact details to communicate with you about your account and to ensure that you are aware of any upcoming events for which you are registered. 
  * We may also contact you to offer new products and services. If you do not want to receive this information, please inform our data controller at [data.controller@bright-talk.com ](mailto:data.controller@bright-talk.com). 



**Disclosure of Information**

We do not release your personally identifying information, and information about your activities and preferences, to other companies wishing to contact you about products and services. We may, however, share your information with partner and suppliers involved in delivering our service proposition. Our partners and suppliers, who receive your personal data, will also not provide your data to other companies wishing to contact you about products and services. 

We may provide third parties with collective profiles of our user groups and their activities and preferences. Such collective profiles may also be disclosed in describing our site and services to prospective partners and other third parties, and for other lawful purposes. 

We may disclose your information, as necessary, to fulfil legal and regulatory requirements; to effect a sale, assignment, or other transfer of our assets or one or more of our service agreements; or if we believe, in good faith, that such disclosure is legally required or necessary to protect others' rights or to prevent harm. 

**Sensitive Information**

We do not generally seek to collect sensitive personal data through this site. If we do seek to collect such data, we will ask you to consent to our proposed uses of the data. We may also collect some sensitive data incidentally. By providing us with unsolicited sensitive personal data, you consent to our using the data subject to applicable law as described in this Privacy Statement. 

**Rights of Access**

**Data Security**

We store your sensitive information in secure operating environments that are not available to unauthorised people. We have taken all necessary safeguards and security measures to protect your privacy, however, you should understand and accept that under the current technology, the Internet is such that data may flow over networks without security measures and may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. BrightTALK in no way whatsoever provides or implies an absolute warranty of security and protection to you.
