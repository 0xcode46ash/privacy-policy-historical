# Online Services Privacy Policy

Updated February 2013

Bright House Networks is committed to respecting and protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy applies to your use of our websites, mobile sites, applications, and/or other services provided by Bright House Networks that link to this Privacy Policy (“Online Services”).

This Policy does not cover information about you that is collected by Bright House Networks in connection with the provision of our cable television services, high-speed Internet services, and phone services.  This Policy is published at [www.brighthouse.com](http://www.brighthouse.com/). You can call us for a printed copy. We encourage you to read this Policy and call us with any questions.  You should also see our [Online Services User Agreement](https://web.archive.org/corporate/policies/online-user-agreement) (“User Agreement”) for other information concerning your use of our Online Services. By using our Online Services, you accept both this Policy and the User Agreement. 

When we use the terms “Bright House,” “BHN”, “we,” “us,” or “our”, we mean Bright House Networks, LLC and the family of companies we own or control.  The term “you” refers to you as a user to one or more of the Online Services.

**Information We Collect**

**Policy** – It is our policy to collect only the personally identifiable information that we need to provide the Online Services with the quality you desire and deserve.

**BHN Customers** – If you are a customer of BHN, we may collect personally identifiable information including your name, address, age, telephone numbers, account number, social security number, user IDs, passwords, email addresses, and other information as provided to us online or as a customer of BHN.  It is our policy to retain such information only as long as needed for our business purposes or as the law may require.  We take reasonable steps to protect your account information from unauthorized access.

**Online Services Visitors** – When you access our Online Services, we automatically collect access log information about your visit, including information such as the Internet Protocol addresses assigned (numbers assigned to your computer while online), bandwidth used, system and connection performance, browsers used, dates and times of access, and Internet resource requests, including requests to access web pages. We do not store emails sent and received unless left in a BHN High Speed Internet account file.

**Online Services Registrants** – In visiting our Online Services, if you register with us or participate in a contest, survey or online transaction, we may ask for certain personally identifiable information. When we ask you for such information, we will tell you how it will be used and you may elect not to participate.

**Cookies** – We, or a vendor that places advertising on our websites, may use "cookies" to collect information about your visit to our Online Services and to manage information concerning your preferences. A "cookie" is a small computer code added to a file on your computer as a record of its visit. It does not collect or provide your name or any other personal information about you. It can, however, be used to note information about your visit, such as your type of web browser, operating system and Internet Protocol address, to better tailor the site for you. It can also be used to recognize you when you log in as a registered user or as a repeat visitor. This allows us to tailor our site by remembering you and any options you select.  We may share non-personal information obtained from various kinds of cookies with vendors, advertisers and others.  You can control what cookies are accepted by your computer through the settings on your web browser or by deleting them from your files.  Doing so, however, may limit the personalization available to you.

**Advertisers and Other Websites** – We do not control the privacy policies of advertisers or of websites you may link to from our Online Services or by using our services. You should review their websites for questions about their Internet security and privacy.

**Use and Sharing**

**Use Policy** – We consider any personally identifiable information we receive about you to be confidential, and it is our policy to use it only in providing our Online Services.  We may also use such information in dealing with fraud and unauthorized use of our services. BHN may associate personal account information with data from third parties about you or similar persons to better predict your product and service preferences for use in programming, advertising transactions and to market our services to you.

**Aggregate Information** – We use aggregate information about our customers and Online Service visitors for a variety of purposes.  Such aggregate information does not identify individual customers. We may share such aggregate and related demographic information with third parties.

**Retention Policy** – BHN may retain personal customer information in its regular business records as long as someone is a customer or until no longer needed for business or legal purposes.

**Sharing Policy** – It is our overall policy not to disclose to others outside of BHN and our affiliates, vendors and business partners any personally identifiable information about our customers without their prior consent. We do not sell or provide your personal information to parties unconnected with the services we provide without your permission.

**Special Exceptions** – We reserve the right to disclose personally identifiable information in our possession if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to: (1) comply with the law or legal process served on us; (2) protect and defend our rights or property or those of others; (3) respond to fraud, abuse or unauthorized use of our services; (4) enforce our User Agreement, or Acceptable Use Policy; or (5) act in an emergency to protect your safety or that of another.

**Third Parties** – We sometimes use affiliates, vendors or third party partners in association with our Online Services and may provide personally identifiable information about users for such purposes.  In providing such information, we require that the outside party maintain at least the same level of confidentiality that we maintain for such information. In addition, any use by the vendor or third party may not exceed that needed to provide its service.

**Internet Communications** – Unless addressed to us, we do not read email messages, instant messages, online chats, or the content of other online communications that reside on or pass through our networks.  We may however, retain and provide such communications if we are legally required to do so.  Incoming and outgoing email messages are generally scanned electronically to identify and filter out likely spam and for viruses and related problems that could harm your equipment, the network or other users.

**Legal Requirements** – We regularly receive legal requests for customer information from government and law enforcement personnel. We also receive discovery requests in civil litigation. In all such cases, our policy is to cooperate as required by law, but to provide only such information as the law requires. This information is generally sought by subpoena served on BHN. Under current law, many criminal subpoenas require that we not disclose or notify you of the request. Due to this fact and the volume of requests we receive, we cannot assume any duty to notify you of receipt of any legal requests. The law does permit us to disclose to law enforcement, voluntarily and without prior notice, customer information, including the contents of communications, if we reasonably believe that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury requires such disclosure without delay. 

**Internet Security**

**Taking Proper Precautions** – Maintaining the security of your own personal computer is an important part of protecting your own privacy and of helping us protect our network and our customers’ service. You should use and update regularly your antivirus software, firewall and your operating system to prevent unauthorized access by others and harm from various forms of viruses. Persons with questionable intent may use the Internet or email to pose as someone you trust or do business with. You should always be sure who you are dealing with before responding with personal information.

**Access by Others** – It is possible for use of the Internet to be accessed or intercepted by third parties. Moreover, since we cannot control Web sites or Internet services operated by third parties, we recommend that you review the terms of service and privacy policies of those Web sites and services.

**Spam**

Bright House Networks works hard to prevent and to block spam and we encourage your help by preventing unauthorized access to your computer. The law permits companies like BHN to use email to send transactional or relationship messages, such as in confirming that a service has been established or providing information regarding changes in service. If you prefer, you may opt-out of marketing messages we may send by notifying us in response to any you may receive.

**Children's Privacy**

Our Online Services are not directed at, or intended for use by, children under the age of 13.  We do not knowingly allow anyone under 13 to provide any personal information on our websites.  Children should always get permission from a parent or guardian before sending personal information over the Internet. If you believe your child may have provided us with personal information, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/support/contact) and we will delete the information. You can find more information about protecting children’s privacy by contacting the FTC or viewing its website at [http://www.ftc.gov](http://www.ftc.gov/). 

**Customer Access to Information**

You have a right to see the personally identifiable information about you that we collect and maintain in our regular business records.  If you would like to see your personally identifiable information, please contact us by mail or telephone, giving us a reasonable period of time to locate and, if necessary, prepare the information for review, and to arrange an appointment during regular business hours. You will only be permitted to examine records that contain personally identifiable information about your account and no other account. If your review reveals an error in our records, BHN will correct it. We reserve the right to charge you for the cost of retrieving and photocopying any documents that you request.

**Your Enforcement Rights**

You have the right to enforce your legal privacy rights concerning our collection, use and sharing of your personally identifiable information. If you believe that you have been aggrieved by any act of ours, we encourage you to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/support/contact) in order to resolve your question or concern.  Among your remedies, and subject to the Arbitration provisions in the User Agreement, you may seek relief by filing a civil action filed under federal law.  Other rights and remedies are available to you as well, including the right to arbitrate your claim as set forth in the User Agreement.

**Changes in Policy**

We may modify this Policy at any time.  If you find the changes unacceptable, you have the right to cancel service. If you continue to use the service following notice of the changes, we will consider that to be your acceptance of and consent to the changes.

**How to Contact Us**

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding this privacy notice, we encourage you to [contact us](https://web.archive.org/corporate/support/contact) or please call one of our [Business Offices](https://web.archive.org/corporate/support/contact).

**California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights**

California law entitles our California customers to request additional information from a business which shares personally identifiable information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share personally identifiable information with unaffiliated third parties, for their own direct marketing purposes. We may share personally identifiable information with some same-branded affiliates, however, for those affiliates’ direct marketing purposes. If you contact us, we will provide you with the names and addresses of our same-branded affiliates in California and a list of personally identifiable information that we may have shared with them.
