We may also share aggregated or non-personally identifiable information with third parties for other purposes. Such information does not identify you individually, but may include usage, viewing and technical information we collected through our technology. If we are required under applicable law to treat such information as personally identifiable information, then we will only disclose it as described above. Otherwise we may disclose such information for any reason.

If you post comments on the Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you submit is publicly available, can be read, collected, or used by other visitors to the Site, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages.  We are not responsible for the personally identifiable information you choose to post on the Site.  Please see our Terms of Use for more information and for other guidelines about posting content on the Site.

**5\. International Transfer of Data**

We may from time to time transfer or disclose your personally identifiable information to recipients in other countries outside the United States and make it accessible to our parents, subsidiaries, affiliates and third party service providers internationally.

**6\. Changes of Control**

If we sell all or part of our business, or make a sale or transfer of assets, or are otherwise involved in a merger or business transfer, or in the event of bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or similar proceeding, we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.

If you are under 13, you may not attempt to send any information about yourself to us, including your name, address, telephone number, or email address.  In the event that we confirm that we have collected personally identifiable information from someone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, we will delete that information promptly.  If you are a parent or legal guardian of a child under 13 and believe that we might have any information from or about such child, please contact us at the email or mailing address provided at the end of this Privacy Policy.

**8\. An Explanation Of Cookies And Other Technologies**

This section provides more information about some of those technologies used on our Site and how they work.

__Cookies__ _._ A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer or device for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can be used for various purposes, such as to confirm that users are logged in.  

__Pixel Tags and Similar Technologies__. Pixel tags, web beacons and clear gifs can be embedded in web pages, videos, or emails and allow a web server to read certain types of information from your browser, check whether you have viewed a particular web page or email message, and determine, among other things, the time and date on which you viewed the pixel tag, the IP address of your computer or device, and the URL of the web page from which the pixel tag was viewed.

__Flash Cookies.__ A “Flash cookie” (also known as Local Shared Object) is a data file stored on your computer or device by the websites that you visit (click [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_shared_object) for more details). From time to time, the Site may use Flash cookie(s), for example, to enable or control Flash-based content. Flash Cookies provide similar functionality as the cookies discussed above in this section, but are based on different technology.

__HTML5__ _Storage_. HTML5 local storage is similar to the cookies discussed above in that it is stored on your computer or device and can be used to store certain information about your activities and preferences. However, these objects are stored in different parts of your computer or device from ordinary browser cookies.

**9\. Third Party Sites**

__Third Party Sites__. The Site may also contain links to other third party websites.  This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by BrightEdge. Even if the third party is affiliated with us through a business partnership or otherwise, we are not responsible for the privacy practices of other websites.  We encourage you to familiarize yourself with the privacy policies of such websites to determine how they handle any information they separately collect from you. Please be aware that we do not warn you when you have chosen to click through to another website or property when using the Site.

**10\. Your Controls and Choices**

__Opt-Outs__ _._ We may provide you with the opportunity to “opt-out” of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes when we ask for this information. If you decide to opt-out, we may not be able to provide certain features of the Site to you.

__Communication Preferences.__ If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included on such communications or on the Site. Please note, however, that you may not have the option to opt-out of certain service-related communications.

__Blocking Cookies__ _._ You can remove or block certain cookies using the settings in your browser but the Site may cease to function properly if you do so.

__Controlling Flash Cookies__. To manage the Flash cookie settings and preferences for your computer, please click [here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html) and you will be directed to the Settings Manager on Adobe's website. You may also be able to manage Flash cookies from your browser, depending on the version of your browser.

__Deleting Other Browser Information__ _.   _Many Internet browsers allow you to disable HTML5 local storage or delete information contained in HTML5 local storage using browser controls. 

**11\. Accessing and Updating Personally identifiable information**

If you would like to request access to, or correction of, your personally identifiable information we hold about you, please contact us using the contact details in the section titled “Contact Us”.  We will respond to all such requests within thirty (30) days and will provide you with access to the information we hold about you, including for the purpose of correcting or updating that information, unless a legal exemption from providing such access applies.  If we refuse to provide you with access to, or correct, the information, we will notify you of our reasons for the refusal to the extent required and how you may complain about the refusal. 

We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical, or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort.  However, we will not charge you for the making of the request or to correct or update your personally identifiable information.

Please note that if you cease using the Site or we terminate your access to the Site in accordance with our Terms of Use, you may no longer have the ability to access or update your personally identifiable information.  

**12\. Storage and Security**

We hold your personally identifiable information in a combination of hard copy and electronic files for the period necessary to support the Site, comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or otherwise fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.  We use third party information system providers who may store or have access to your personal information. Even after you cancel your account, copies of some information from your account may remain viewable in some circumstances where, for example, you have shared information with social media or other services.  We may also retain backup information related to your account on our servers for some time after cancelation for fraud detection or to comply with applicable law or our internal security policies.  We do not always remove or delete all of your information for a number of reasons including due to technical and systems constraints, contractual, financial or legal requirements.

We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive personally identifiable information (such as information related to racial or ethnic origin, religion or other beliefs, health, criminal background or trade union membership) on or through the Site or otherwise.  If, contrary to this request, you do provide any sensitive information, in doing so you consent to us collecting and handling that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

The security of your personally identifiable information is important to us.  When you enter confidential information (such as your password), we may encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology.  (To learn more about such technology, go to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Sockets_Layer>).  However, no method of transmission over the Internet, method of electronic storage or other security methods are one hundred percent secure.  Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means such as firewalls, password-protected databases with limited physical or electronic access, and encryption to protect your personally identifiable information against unauthorized use, disclosure or modification, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

**13\. Enforcement**

BrightEdge regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy.  We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personally identifiable information that cannot be resolved between BrightEdge and an individual.

If you have a concern about your privacy or you would like to know more about how your personally identifiable information is collected, or used please contact us.  We ask that when you contact us with a complaint, please include contact information and clearly describe your complaint.  We will respond to your request or complaint within a reasonable time and will let you know next steps in resolving your complaint.  If you are not satisfied with our response, you may also contact your local and federal data protection authorities to lodge a complaint. 

**14\. Terms of Use, Notices and Revisions**

Please also see our [Terms of Use](https://www.brightedge.com/legal), which describe the restrictions, disclaimers, indemnification and limitation of liability governing the use of the Site. 

We reserve the right to change our Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use at any time.  Non-material changes and clarifications will take effect immediately, and material changes will take effect within 30 days of their posting on the Site (unless we specify a different notice period).  If we make changes, we will post them and will indicate on this page the policy’s new effective date.  If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you here, by email, or through notice on our home page.  We encourage you to refer to this policy on an ongoing basis so that you understand our current privacy practices.  Unless stated otherwise in a separate agreement or privacy statement, this Privacy Policy applies to all information that we have about you.  We may also issue specific information collection privacy notice from time-to-time relating to particular products or services.

**15\. Notice to California Residents: Your California Privacy Rights**

If you are a California resident, it is our policy pursuant to California’s Shine the Light Law (CA Civil Code Section 1798.83) not to disclose your personally identifiable information to third parties for such third parties’ direct marketing purposes if you have opted-out of such disclosures. To make an opt-out request, please contact us at the e-mail or mailing address at the end of this policy. Please note that even if you do choose to opt-out, we may still share your personally identifiable information with third-parties for purposes other than direct marketing, such as for completing a requested transaction or any other non-direct marketing purposes permitted under this policy.
