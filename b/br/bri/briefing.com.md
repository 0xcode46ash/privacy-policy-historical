Information Collection and Use

Information Collection

Briefing.com is the sole owner of the information collected on [www.briefing.com](http://www.briefing.com/). Briefing.com collects information from our users at several different points on our Web site. We do not share, sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third parties for unknown reasons. 

Registration

Briefing.com has a _free_ non-subscription area within the _Investor_ service. Most areas do not require registration to use. However, some Calendars do require registration in order to access due to contractual obligations with third-party content providers. Briefing.com also has a _free_ mobile version of the _Investor_ service which does not require registration of any kind. Any user is free to access this area of the Web site or the _Investor_ mobile site without submitting any personal contact information. 

Briefing.com also has several subscription areas in the site as well as a mobile site which subscribers may access. In order to use these subscription areas in the Web site or the subscription-based mobile site, a user must first complete a registration form. During registration a user is required to give contact information (such as name and e-mail address). We use this information to contact the user about services on our site for which he has purchased a subscription to access; and unique identifiers (such as, username and password).

We request information from the user on our subscriber form. A user must provide contact information (such as name, e-mail, and mailing address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes. If we have trouble processing an order, the information is used to contact the user. Briefing.com stores this information as part of the subscription. For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

Information Use

Profile

We store information that we collect through log files, clear gifs, and/or third parties to create a profile of our users. The profile is used as a whole, rather than individually to track user preferences, but not individual patterns of use. We do not share your profile with other third parties.

 **Tracking Technologies**

We Briefing.com and our partners use technologies such as cookies or similar technologies to analyze trends, administer the website, track users’ movements around the website, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. Users can control the use of cookies at the individual browser level. 

**Log Files**

Like most standard Web site servers we use log files. This includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses, etc. are not linked to personally identifiable information. We use a tracking utility called Google Universal that uses log files to analyze user movement. These log files are not tied to the user’s personal information.

Third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our site or to display advertising based upon your Web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 or Flash to collect and store information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please click here: <http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html>.

For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections. 

**Customer Service**

We send all new members a confirmation e-mail to verify password and username after registration.

We reply via e-mail or phone, in accordance with the user's preferences. Generally, users may not opt-out of these communications which are not promotional in nature. If you do not wish to receive them, you have the option to de-activate your account.

We also may contact users who have not checked out, not completed registration, or abandoned forms to follow up and see if there was problem with their use of the site. Users may opt-out of these communications at any time. For more information, please see the Choice and Opt-out sections.

**Legal Disclaimer**

In certain situations, Briefing.com may be required to disclose personal data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. Though we make every effort to preserve user privacy, we may need to disclose personal information when required by law wherein we have a good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with a current judicial proceeding, a court order or legal process served on our Web site. 

**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**

We share aggregated demographic information with our partners and advertisers. This is not linked to any personally identifiable information. 

**Third Party Advertisers**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by [clicking here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads. 

**Third Party Intermediaries**

**Service Providers**

We may license content from other third parties such as Capital IQ, Deutsche Borse, FactSet, Wall Street Horizon and Retail Metrics for the benefit of our readers. We do not share any information with our third party content providers. 

**Business Transitions**

In the event Briefing.com goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' personal information will, in most instances, be part of the assets transferred. Users will be notified via prominent notice on our Web site for 30 days prior to a change of ownership or control of their personal information. If as a result of the business transition, the users' personally identifiable information will be used in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection they will be given choice consistent with our notification of changes section.

Choice/Opt-out

Users who no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications may opt-out of receiving these communications by managing their e-mail preferences within their service under Account Settings.

Michigan Avenue, Suite 1910, Chicago, IL 60611 to opt-out.

**Do Not Track Requests**

Briefing.com does not track and does not provide a user's personal information to a third party unless it is at the subscriber’s request. Therefore, Briefing.com makes no response if a browser submits a "do not track" request. 

**Links**

This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, Briefing.com, are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by Briefing.com. 

**Logging in with Facebook Connect**

You can log in to our Investor (free) site using Facebook Connect. This service will authenticate your identity and provide you the option to share certain personal information with us such as your name and email address to pre-populate our sign up form. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Web site to your profile page to share with others within your network. 

**Social Media Widgets**

Our Web site includes Social Media Features, such as the Facebook and Twitter buttons and Widgets or interactive mini-programs that run on our site. These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our site, and may set a cookie to enable the Feature to function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our Site. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy statement of the company providing it. 

**Surveys**

From time-to-time our site requests information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes demographic information (such as income and online trading habits). This anonymous survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site. Though we may use an intermediary to conduct these surveys, they may not use users' personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes. 

**Security**

This Web site takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the Web site, their information is protected both online and off-line.

When our registration form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number) that information is encrypted and is protected with the best encryption software in the industry - SSL. While on a secure page, such as our order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Chrome, FireFox, and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when users are just 'surfing'.

While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our users' information, not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job [for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative] are granted access to personally identifiable information. Our employees must use password-protected screen-savers when they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter their password to re-gain access to user information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. At the time of hire, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our users' information is protected. Finally, the servers that store personally identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a state-of the-art co-location locked facility.

We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

If users have any questions about the security at our Web site, users can send an e-mail to [service@briefing.com](mailto:service@briefing.com).

Correcting/Updating/Deleting/Deactivating Personal Information

Upon request Briefing.com will provide you with information about whether we hold any of your personal information. If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, e-mail or postal address), or if a user no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or delete/deactivate users' personally identifiable information. This can be done by emailing our Customer Support team at [service@briefing.com](mailto:service@briefing.com). Or users may contact us by telephone or postal mail at the contact information listed below. We will respond to your request to access within a reasonable timeframe.

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

**Notification of Changes**

If we decide to change our privacy statement, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. We will use information in accordance with the privacy statement under which the information was collected.

If, however, we are going to use users' personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time of collection we will notify users via e-mail prior to the change becoming effective. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. However, if users have opted out of all communication with the site, or deleted/deactivated their account, then they will not be contacted, nor will their personal information be used in this new manner. In addition, if we make any material changes in our privacy practices that do not affect user information already stored in our database, we will post a prominent notice on our Web site notifying users of the change. In some cases where we post a notice we will also e-mail users, who have opted to receive communications from us, notifying them of the changes in our privacy practices prior to the change becoming effective.
