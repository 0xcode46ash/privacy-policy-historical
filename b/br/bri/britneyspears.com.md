**The following privacy policy applies to all Entertainment Drive ("eDrive") online websites, whether Starclubs or other products:**

**eDrive's Privacy Policy:**  
Privacy on the World Wide Web is important, and we would like to make clear what types of information we gather, how we use it, and how you can correct, change, or delete information that you submit to us (or decline to submit it, if you prefer). 

**Information Collected by eDrive Websites:**  
eDrive collects two different types of personally identifying information from users of its products: a) Personal data, such as names and email addresses: this type of data is collected when you provide it to eDrive, by means of registration for newsletters, or entering contests, answering surveys, purchasing products online, posting messages to chat boards, etc. b) Collective data, such as which pages you may access, site registrations, IP addresses (what IP address you are coming from) and so on. 

**Use of Information Collected by eDrive:**  
eDrive uses both the personal and collective data for purposes such as improvement and customization of site content or layout for each customer and to notify users with respect to updates to the site, or promotional opportunities, contests or other offers that may interest them. eDrive may also share data with third parties for advertising, marketing and promotional purposes. By submitting personal data by means of registration for newsletters or entering contests, answering surveys, purchasing products, posting messages, etc., you agree to such use of this data, and understand and agree that advertising and/or promotional language may be included in transmissions to your submitted email address. 

If you would prefer that personal information provided by you not be used for these purposes, you may prevent that use by responding to the "remove" language included in promotional emails, or by sending an email to webmaster@edrive.com . 

**Young People and Privacy**  
eDrive encourages the participation of parents and guardians in their children's use of online services. eDrive may request age information from users of its sites in various locations in its online products, and may ask whether a user is under the age of 18, or 13, when requesting the submission of personal information. It may also ask for parental consent to the submission of such information, and relies on users to provide truthful responses to these questions. 

**Users Under 13 Years of Age**  
Individuals under 13 years of age should not submit or post information on eDrive sites without the consent of their parent or guardian. With the parent or guardian's consent, eDrive may use this information for marketing and promotional purposes relating to the website. However, eDrive does not provide any personal information provided by such users to any third party. 

**Users between 13 and 18 Years of Age**  
eDrive requests that individuals under the age of 18 do not submit or post information to an eDrive site without the consent of a parent or guardian. eDrive may collect information, including personal information, from users between 13 and 18, and with the permission of their parent or guardian this information may be used for marketing and promotional purposes by eDrive, and may be shared with third parties. If a user or said user's parent or guardian should change their mind with regard to such use, the user, parent or guardian may stop that use by email request to webmaster@edrive.com. Users under the age of 18 are usually asked not to participate in contests or sweepstakes. 

**Message Boards and Chat**  
Please remember that information posted to message boards and chat areas becomes public, and use appropriate caution when posting. Users under the age of 18 should be careful not to provide any personal information while using message boards and chat rooms, and must follow the standards of behavior set forth in each site's Terms of Use when posting messages online. 

**Links to Other Sites**  
Please note that eDrive products contain links to sites other than those it owns, operates and manages, and that those sites may not follow the same privacy policies as eDrive. These sites may include those linked to eDrive sites by ad banners, and content providers and partners who may use logos or styles adapted from eDrive or its Starclubs products as a result of a co-branding agreement. These sites may collect data and make use of it in ways that eDrive would not. 

USE OF THIS SITE SIGNIFIES YOUR AGREEMENT TO THE TERMS OF USE AND THIS PRIVACY POLICY. 

eDrive reserves the right to change this policy at any time by notifying users of the existence of a revised privacy policy. If you submitted personal information to this website prior to this policy's posting, that information will be used for promotional and marketing purposes and shared with third parties unless you request its withdrawal from our database. You can send email to us with any further questions or requests for the withdrawal of your personal information from our database at any time to webmaster@edrive.com.
