For example, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as demographic information, if you choose to complete any of the online forms used for class registration, special events and promotions, appointment requests, and to provide feedback. Additional questions may be included to help us improve the services we offer. It is important to remember that only designated staff within Partners HealthCare will have access on a need to know basis to the information you provide.

Please do not provide personal information via e-mail to the hospital unless it is through a secure channel (these will be marked, as secure online forms, for example). Remember that e-mail messages, unless encrypted while in transit, can be viewed by other Internet users. If you have individualized information to communicate, please use the appropriate secure online form or contact the necessary party using traditional means such as phone or mail.

**3\. Does Brigham and Women's Hospital use "cookies" or IP Addresses to collect user information?**  
Cookies are small pieces of information that some websites store on your computer’s hard drive when you visit them. Like many other websites, brighamandwomens.org uses aggregate data compiled by cookies to provide us with information about traffic to our site. Collecting this information does not allow us to personally identify you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse them or to alert you when they are being sent. You may modify your web browsers to reject cookies from our site if you wish. You can access the information on the Brigham and Women's Hospital web site without having cookies enabled in your browser.

We collect and log the IP address (an identification number associated with your computer) of all visitors to brighamandwomens.org. This allows us to administer our system to gather aggregate information about how our site is being used. To maintain your privacy, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal health information.

We may use Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., and other online analytics services on our sites. These analytic services help us analyze how users interact with and use the web site, compile reports on the web site activity, and provide other services related to web site activity and usage. These technologies may use cookies and collect information such as your IP address, time of visit, whether you are a return visitor, any referring website, and other information. We do not use Google Analytics to gather information that personally identifies you. Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Use and the Google Privacy Policy.

**5\. How does Brigham and Women's Hospital handle privacy internally?**  
Brigham and Women's Hospital is committed to protecting the privacy of the personal information you provide to us via this website so that we can make sure it remains as secure as possible. Accordingly, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access by a secure firewall and use a security infrastructure that protects the integrity and privacy of such personal information. As an additional security measure, your personal information is also encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption software. Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive data across the Internet. Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.
