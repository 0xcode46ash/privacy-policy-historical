**1.  Information You Provide to Us**

You may use most of the Brigham and Women's site without providing any personal information, except as explained below.

Sometimes we do need information to provide services that you request.  For example, you may be asked to provide personal information, such as demographic information, if you choose to complete any of the on-line forms used for class registration, special events and promotions, appointment requests, and to provide feedback.   Additional questions may be included to help us improve the services we offer.  Only designated  staff  within Partners will have access on a need to know basis to the information you provide _.  _

Please do not provide personal information via email to the hospital unless it is through a secure channel (these will be marked, as secure on-line forms, for example). Remember that e-mail messages, while in transit, can be viewed by other Internet users. If you have individualized information to communicate, please use the appropriate secure on-line form or contact the necessary party using traditional means such as phone or mail.

If you wish to subscribe to our Health E-Newsletter, we collect and store first and last name and email address. This information is used for distribution purposes. You can unsubscribe to the e-newsletter at any time by clicking [here to unsubscribe.](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/forms/newsletter/newsletter_unregister.asp)

As explained below (see #3), we also collect and log the IP address (and identification number associated with your computer) when you visit the hospital’s web site.

BWH currently uses all reasonable efforts to protect against disclosure of personal information you provide on the Web, except if we need to process credit card information you have given us or as required by law. We have no current plans to make other disclosures of such information. If this changes, then we will post a revised on-line privacy policy. 

Brigham and Women's Hospital may occasionally provide statistics to third parties related to the number of visitors who use the site. These statistics do not provide personally identifiable information.

**2.Does Brigham and Women's Hospital use "cookies" or IP Addresses to collect user information?**

Cookies are small pieces of information that some web sites store on your computer's hard drive when you visit them.   Like many other websites, brighamandwomens.org uses aggregate data compiled by cookies to provide us with information about traffic to our site.   Collecting this information does not allow us to personally identify you. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can set your browser to refuse them or to alert you when they are being sent. You may modify your web browsers to reject cookies from our site if you wish.You can access the information on the Brigham and Women's Hospital web site without having cookies enabled in your browser.

We collect and log the IP address (an identification number associated with your computer) of all visitors to brighamandwomens.org.  This allows us to administer our system to gather aggregate information about how our site is being used.  To maintain your privacy, we do not associate IP addresses with records containing personal health information.

**3.Are there advertisements on Brigham and Women's web site?**

At present Brigham and Women's hospital **does not accept** advertisements on its Web Site

**4.How does Brigham and Women's Hospital handle privacy internally?**

Brigham and Women's Hospital wants any personal information that you provide to us via this web site to remain as secure as possible. Accordingly, we use all reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access by a secure firewall and use of security infrastructure to protect the integrity and privacy of such personal information. As an additional security measure, your personal information is also encrypted during transmission by Secure Socket Layer 128-bit encryption software. (Encryption is a common method used to transmit sensitive data across the Internet. Encryption temporarily makes the text unreadable during the time it is being transmitted over the Internet.) Please note, that for encryption to work, your browser must be Netscape or Internet Explorer version 4.0 or higher, also encrypted. Not all versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer have 128-bit encryption capability; you will have to download the upgrade for that level of encryption.

**5\. Which web pages and web sites does this policy apply to?**

**This on-line Privacy Policy applies only to the Brigham and Women's Hospital Web site.** The Brigham and Women's Hospital site contains links to other sites, within and outside of Partners. Please be aware that this on-line policy does not apply to those sites. We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy on any other sites before providing them with personal information.

Certain interactive patient transactions may be linked to this site as a convenience for you. If you choose to utilize a specific patient application, please be sure to read the privacy policy associated with that particular transaction. Partners Patient Gateway, which offers patients secure electronic messaging to participating  Brigham and Women's Hospital practices, is an example of such a patient application.

Please note that the [Partners Privacy Notice](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/family/privacynoticesall.asp) more generally explains the hospital’s and Partners’ commitment to protect the privacy of personal health information.
