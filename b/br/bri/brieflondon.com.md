City Directory Privacy Policy

_____________ (“Provider”) takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy. 

What This Privacy Policy Covers

  * This policy covers how Provider treats personal information that Provider collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Provider products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, or phone number, and that is not otherwise publicly available.
  * This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Provider does not own or control, or to people that Provider does not employ or manage. 



Information Collection and Use

General

  * Provider and/or its licensors collect personal information when you register with Provider, when you use Provider products or services, when you visit Provider pages or the pages of certain Provider partners, and when you enter promotions or sweepstakes. Provider and/or its licensors may combine information about you that we have with information we obtain from business partners or other companies.
  * When you register we ask for information that may include your name, email address, birth date, gender, ZIP code, occupation, industry, and personal interests. When you register with Provider and sign in to our services, you are not anonymous to us.
  * Provider and/or its licensors collect information about your transactions with us and with some of our business partners, including information about your use of the products and services that we offer.
  * Provider and/or its licensors automatically receive and record information from your computer and browser, including your IP address, Provider cookie information, software and hardware attributes, and the page you request.
  * Provider and/or its licensors may use information for the following general purposes: to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, contact you, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients.



Children

  * When a child under age 13 attempts to register with Provider, we ask the child to have a parent or guardian create a Provider Family Account to obtain parental permission.
  * Provider does not contact children under age 13 about special offers or for marketing purposes without a parent’s permission.
  * Provider does not ask a child under age 13 for more personal information, as a condition of participation, than is reasonably necessary to participate in a given activity or promotion.



Information Sharing and Disclosure

  * Provider does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or non-affiliated companies except for us and our licensors and vendors to provide products or services you’ve requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:



·         We provide the information to trusted partners who work on behalf of or with Provider under confidentiality agreements. These companies may use your personal information to help Provider communicate with you about offers from Provider and our marketing partners. However, these companies do not have any independent right to share this information.

·         We have a parent’s permission to share the information if the user is a child under age 13. Parents have the option of allowing Provider to collect and use their child’s information without consenting to Provider sharing of this information with people and companies who may use this information for their own purposes.

·         We respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal process, or to establish or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims.

·         We believe it is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Provider’s terms of use, or as otherwise required by law.

·         We transfer information about you if Provider is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Provider will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

  * Provider displays targeted advertisements based on personal information. Advertisers (including ad serving companies) may assume that people who interact with, view, or click targeted ads meet the targeting criteria—for example, women ages 18-24 from a particular geographic area.



·         Provider does not provide any personal information to the advertiser when you interact with or view a targeted ad. However, by interacting with or viewing an ad you are consenting to the possibility that the advertiser will make the assumption that you meet the targeting criteria used to display the ad.

·         Provider advertisers include financial service providers (such as banks, insurance agents, stock brokers and mortgage lenders) and non-financial companies (such as stores, airlines, and software companies).

  * Provider works with vendors, partners, advertisers, and other service providers in different industries and categories of business. For more information regarding providers of products or services that you’ve requested please read our detailed reference links.



Cookies

  * Provider may set and access Provider cookies on your computer.
  * Provider lets other companies that show advertisements on some of our pages set and access their cookies on your computer. Other companies’ use of their cookies is subject to their own privacy policies, not this one. Advertisers or other companies do not have access to Provider’s cookies.
  * Provider uses web beacons to access Provider cookies inside and outside our network of web sites and in connection with Provider products and services.

  * New categories of marketing communications might be added to the Marketing Preferences page from time to time.
