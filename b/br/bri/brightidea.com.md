This Privacy Policy describes how Brightidea Incorporated, collects and uses information about you when you use the Brightidea.com Web Site (“Site”).

**      Collection of Personal Information   ** In an effort to provide you with customized content and enhanced features, we gather general information concerning your use of this site as well as any optional personal information that you voluntarily provide to us. Following are examples of the types of information that we collect: 

* _Your IP address_. We use your IP address to administer our site and help diagnose problems with our server. Your IP address also is used to help identify you. 
* _Cookies_. A cookie is a small data file that certain sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can track information such as a user ID and the various pages that you have visited. We use secure cookies to personalize the information that is delivered to you and for internal aggregate reporting to enhance our site. We also may use ad agencies to place advertising, such as banner ads, on our site. Such advertising may contain cookies that collect information for the ad agency. We will not have access to this information nor will we be able to control the use of this information. 
* _Registration forms_. As part of the registration process you will be asked to provide your e-mail address and a password. We may use this contact data to send you information and ideas relating to your stated personal preferences.
* _Idea Rating System_. An important feature of our site is our idea rating system, which allows visitors to give a rating to ideas on our site. As part of the rating process, we will ask users to rate ideas that they read. The ratings that you give to ideas are private and will not be revealed to anyone. We will aggregate ratings given to each idea for the purpose of identifying those ideas that are most popular with our community.

**       Use of Personal Information   ** The information that we collect allows us to enhance and improve our site and the services offered by our site. Specific uses of collected information include:

* _Personalization of features and services_. Based upon the personal preferences and viewing habits of users, we may send content and information to users that we think may interest them. For example, if a user registers to be alerted for a particular category on our site, we will send them content and information related to that category.
* _Aggregated Information_. All of the information that we collect is aggregated, which means that information is grouped together in a way that does not disclose the personal information of any one particular individual. Aggregated information may be provided to our affiliates or advertisers. We may produce aggregated reports for advertisers identifying, for example, the number of users that visit our site or different areas of our site, the number of users that clicked on an advertisement or the number of users that read a particular idea. This aggregated information will not include personally identifiable information about you or your use of our site.

We urge you to use a password to protect your account from unauthorized access by others. If others, including family or household members, access and use the Site through your password, you are responsible for the actions of those individuals.

 **       Children's Privacy    **This site contains ideas and other content that may be of interest to children. We do not restrict the use of our site to users over the age of 18 nor do we ask the age of our users.
