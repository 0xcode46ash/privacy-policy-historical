# Privacy Policy - BrightFuse

##  Protect Your Privacy And Safety

These days, we all need to be smart about the way we use our own personal data. So that you can be smarter about the way you manage your professional networking resources, BrightFuse continues to strive to provide the safest possible environment for you to do so.

##  Overview

We have created this Privacy Policy to demonstrate our commitment to protecting information you submit. This Privacy Policy only applies to data gathered on the BrightFuse web site (the "Site"), and does not apply to any other information or web site. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically as we may update it from time to time. This Privacy Policy is effective as of March 1, 2008. Each time you visit the Site or provide us with information, you are, by doing so, accepting the practices described in this Privacy Policy at that time. You agree that by using the Site you are expressly and affirmatively consenting to our use and disclosure of the information that you provide, and consenting to receive emails, as described below in this Privacy Policy.

##  Personal Information

In order to operate the Site in an efficient and effective manner and provide users with relevant networking opportunities, BrightFuse may collect personal information, including contact information (such as an email address), from its users. In addition, this information allows us to provide users with private and secure areas to post and modify their original content on our site (e.g., resumes, interests and professional experience). We also automatically track certain information based upon your behavior on the Site and use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve users in general. This information may include the URL that a user has just come from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), the URL a user goes to next (whether this URL is on our Site or not), a user's computer browser information, and their IP address.

You agree that BrightFuse may use your personal information to contact you and deliver information to you that, in some cases, is targeted to your interests, or provides administrative notices or communications applicable to your use of the Site. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you expressly agree to receive this information. If you do not wish to receive these communications, we encourage you to opt out of any further receipt by following the opt out provisions provided in each such communication.

We do not sell our users' personal information to anyone for any reason if the user has indicated a desire for us to keep the information private. When posting profile information, our users decide for themselves how much contact information they wish to display (we enable private communication for those who choose to hide this information).

All users should be aware, however, that when they voluntarily display or distribute personal information (such as their email address or resume), that information can be collected and used by others. This may result in unsolicited messages from third parties for which BrightFuse is not responsible. BrightFuse may also disclose specific user information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with the law, to cooperate with or seek assistance from law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of BrightFuse or other users of the Site. In addition, personal information we have collected may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets or a bankruptcy of BrightFuse

##  About Cookies

At BrightFuse, we use cookies only for the protection and convenience of our users. Cookies enable us to serve secure pages to our users without asking them to sign in repeatedly. If a user's system is idle for more than an hour, however, the cookie will expire, forcing the user to sign in again to continue their session. This prevents unauthorized access to the user's information while they are away from their computer. You may have the ability to reset your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent; however, some BrightFuse features or services may not function properly without cookies.

Third-Party Cookies: We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit the Site. These companies may use information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this and other web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. 

##  Advertising

We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use information about you and your visits to this and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements on this site and other sites about goods and services of interest to you.

##  What You Should Know

BrightFuse cannot ensure that all of your private communications and other personal information will never be disclosed in ways not otherwise described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, although we are committed to protecting your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private. As a user of the Site, you understand and agree that you assume all responsibility and risk for your use of the Site, the internet generally, and the documents you post or access and for your conduct on and off the Site.

##  Some Important Tips To Use When Dealing With Prospective Contacts

  * Never give out your social security number to other users.
  * Never provide credit card or bank numbers or monetary transaction of any sort.
  * Be cautious when dealing with contacts outside of your own country.
  * Do not provide any non-work related personal information (i.e. social security number, eye color, marital status etc.) over the phone or online.



##  Other Privacy Features On BrightFuse

Logging into BrightFuse is always an optional task for you to take, (although logging is required if you would like to contact other users or edit your profile).

##  Post A Profile

Posting your profile on BrightFuse puts you in contact with thousands of other users. When you post your profile, we automatically create a registration for you using the email address and password that you supply. When you return to the site in the future you will use that same email address and password to access and edit your existing profile.

##  Profile Privacy Options

We know that our users have varying levels of comfort when it comes to posting information on the Internet. To accommodate the needs of all users, BrightFuse has two levels of privacy from which you can choose.

##  Public Profile

This option gives you the most visibility to other users possible. Your profile may be found by searching our database. It may also be found using any publicly available internet search engine. Anyone may view your profile information.

##  Friends-Only Profile

Your profile may be found by searching our database. However, the information in your profile may only be seen by those BrightFuse users you have approved as a contact. BrightFuse users that are not your contacts will see very limited information about you, e.g. your name, location, and in some cases your job title. 

##  Your General Contact Information

Managing your privacy is as simple as selecting which pieces of your contact information are displayed. This is done in the section of the profile form called "Edit Basic Information." 

##  Help Us Monitor Fraud

Please be advised that BrightFuse will never initiate a request for your personal information via email or pop-up window. If you ever receive a request for this type of sensitive information, please do not respond and immediately contact BrightFuse customer service at [contactus@brightfuse.com](mailto:contactus@brightfuse.com). 

If you think you have been a victim of fraud, immediately report the committed fraud to your local police and contact us at [contactus@brightfuse.com](mailto:contactus@brightfuse.com) so steps can be taken for your safety.
