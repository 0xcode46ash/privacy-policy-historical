Privacy Policy

1\. Introduction and General Terms  
BRIT Awards Limited (“BAL”) is committed to protecting you and your family’s personal information when you are using BAL services. We want our services to be safe and enjoyable environments for our audience. This Privacy Policy relates to our use of any personal information you provide to us through the brits.co.uk or classicalbrits.co.uk websites or the BRITs pages of the bpi.co.uk website.

In order to provide you with the full range of BAL services, we are sometimes required to collect information about you.  
This privacy policy explains the following:  
• what information BAL may collect about you;   
• how BAL will use information we collect about you;   
• when BAL may use your details to contact you;   
• whether BAL will disclose your details to anyone else;   
• your choices regarding the personal information you have provided to us;   
• the use of cookies on BAL websites and how you can reject these cookies. 

As set out above, BAL is committed to safeguarding your personal information. Whenever you provide such information, we are legally obliged to use your information in line with all laws concerning the protection of personal information, including the Data Protection Act 1998 (these laws are referred to collectively in this Privacy Policy as the “data protection laws”).  
The websites contain hyperlinks to websites owned and operated by third parties. These third party websites have their own privacy policies, including cookies, and we urge you to review them. They will govern the use of personal information you submit or are collected by cookies whilst visiting these websites. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the privacy practices of such third party websites and your use of such websites is at your own risk.

2\. What information will BAL collect about me?  
When you sign up to participate in or receive a service from brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, such as newsletters, competitions/prize draws, live chats, message boards or register with brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, we may ask for personal information about you. This can consist of information such as your name, email address, postal address, telephone or mobile number or date of birth. Different web pages may ask for different personal information.   
By entering your details in the fields requested, you enable BAL and its service providers to provide you with the services you select.   
Please note that sometimes on particular web pages we will require you to provide additional personal information. When we do this we will specify further on these web pages why we are collecting your information and how we will use it.  
BAL also uses cookies (see paragraph 12 for details) and may collect IP addresses (an IP address is a number that can uniquely identify a specific computer or other network device on the internet). 

3\. How will BAL use the information they collect about me?  
BAL will use your personal information for a number of purposes including the following:  
• for “service administration purposes”, which means that BAL may contact you for reasons related to the service you have signed up for, as set out in paragraph 4 (e.g. to provide you with password reminders or to notify you that a particular service has been suspended for maintenance);   
• to contact you about a submission you have made to the websites, including any content you provide;   
• IP addresses are used to identify the location of users, the number of visits from different countries and also to block disruptive use; and   
• to analyse and improve the services offered on brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk. e.g. to provide you with the most user-friendly navigation experience.   
Where BAL proposes using your personal information for any other uses we will ensure that we notify you first. You will also be given the opportunity to withhold or withdraw your consent for your use other than as listed above.

4\. When will BAL contact me?  
BAL may contact you:  
• in relation to the functioning of any service you have signed up for in order to ensure that BAL can deliver the services to you;   
• where you have opted to receive further correspondence;   
• in relation to any contribution you have made to brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, e.g. on BAL message boards;   
• to invite you to participate in surveys about BAL services (participation is always voluntary); and   
• for marketing purposes where you have specifically agreed to this (see paragraph 5)   
Local pages will give you detailed information about how BAL will contact you in relation to specific services.

5\. Will I be contacted for marketing purposes?  
BAL won’t contact you for marketing purposes, or promote new services to you unless you specifically agree to be contacted for these purposes. 

6\. Will BAL share my personal information with anyone else?  
We will keep your information confidential except where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies and law enforcement agencies) or as described in paragraph 7. Generally, we will only use your information within BAL. However, sometimes BAL uses third parties to process your information. BAL will require these third parties to comply strictly with its instructions and BAL will require that they do not use your personal information for their own business purposes. 

7\. Offensive or inappropriate content on BAL websites  
If you post or send offensive, inappropriate or objectionable content anywhere on or to brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, or otherwise engage in any disruptive behaviour on brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, BAL may use your personal information to stop such behaviour.   
Where BAL reasonably believes that you are or may be in breach of any of the laws of England or Wales (e.g. because content you have posted may be defamatory), BAL may use your personal information to inform relevant third parties such as your employer, school e-mail/Internet provider or law enforcement agencies about the content and your behaviour.

8\. What if I am a user aged 16 or under?  
If you are aged 16 or under, please get your parent/guardian’s permission beforehand whenever you provide personal information to BAL’s websites. Users without this consent are not allowed to provide us with personal information. 

9\. How long will BAL keep my personal information?   
We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary for the relevant service, or as long as is set out in any relevant contract you hold with BAL. In the case that you wish to cancel your registration as a brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk member, once an account is deleted, while people cannot use the personal information, it stays on the system for a period of one year for administration purposes before being deleted automatically.  
Where you contribute to brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, BAL will generally only keep your content for as long as is reasonably required for the purpose(s) for which it was submitted. 

10\. Can I find out what personal information BAL holds about me?  
Under the Data Protection Act you have the right to request a copy of the personal information BAL holds about you and to have any inaccuracies corrected. (We charge £10 for information requests and will require you to prove your identity with 2 pieces of approved photographic identification.) We will use reasonable efforts to supply, correct or delete personal information about you on our files.

Please address requests and questions about this or any other question about this Privacy Policy to The Data Protection Officer, BRIT Awards Limited, Riverside Building, County Hall, London, SE1 7JA Email: [contactus@brits2008.com](mailto:contactus@brits2008.com)

11\. What if I am accessing BAL websites outside the UK?  
www.brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk and the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk is published in the UK by BAL. All personal information submitted by you to the site will be processed in accordance with this Privacy Policy (and any local terms that apply on websites) unless terms on sites specify otherwise.

12\. Changes to BAL’s Privacy Policy  
This privacy policy may be updated from time to time so you may wish to check it each time you submit personal information to any brits.co.uk or classicalbrits.co.uk website or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk website. The date of the most recent revisions will appear on this page.

13\. Cookies Policy -Information BAL collects from you  
a. What is a cookie?  
A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes a unique identifier that is sent to your computer or mobile phone (referred to here as a “device”) browser from a website’s computer and is stored on your device’s hard drive. Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your browser’s preferences allow it, but (to protect your privacy) your browser only permits a website to access the cookies it has already sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other sites. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their website in order to track online traffic flows.  
Cookies record information about your online preferences and allow us to tailor the websites to your interests. Users have the opportunity to set their devices to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time. The last of these means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user and accordingly you may not be able to take full advantage of all of the brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk features. Each browser is different, so check the “Help” menu of your browser to learn how to change your cookie preferences.

During the course of any visit to brits.co.uk, classicalbrits.co.uk or the BRITs pages of bpi.co.uk, the pages you see, along with a cookie, are downloaded to your device. Many websites do this, because cookies enable website publishers to do useful things like find out whether the device (and probably its user) has visited the website before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.  
b. How does BAL use cookies?  
Information supplied by cookies can help us to analyse the profile of our visitors and help us to keep the websites secure and provide you with a better user experience.

BAL also uses a number of independent measurement and research companies. They gather information regarding the visitors to BAL sites on our behalf using cookies, log file data and code which is embedded on our websites. BAL uses this type of information to help improve the services it provides to its users. BAL strictly requires that this information is not to use any information for their own business or other purposes (see paragraph 6).
