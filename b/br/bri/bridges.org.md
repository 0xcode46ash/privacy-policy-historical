Currently, we request information from anyone who [downloads our free tech.guide](https://web.archive.org/web/20040602183458id_/http%3A//bridges.org/techguide/download.html). We request your name, your organization's name, your email address, and information about your intended use of the guide. We may ask you if it is okay to tell others about your use of the guide. We may also ask you if it is okay to publish or post information about your use of the guide as an announcement in our newsletter or in a list on our website. We will not do this without your permission, and we will never release any other information about you to third parties for any reason.
