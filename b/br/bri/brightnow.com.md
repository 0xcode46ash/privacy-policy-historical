# Privacy Policy | Bright Now! Dental

We are dedicated to protecting your personal information and we pledge to keep it confidential and secure, in accordance with your decisions.

We are rapidly developing our service to meet your needs, and therefore reserve the right to modify this policy without advance notice. Currently this Online Privacy Policy applies to all users of Brightnow.com, Monarchdental.com, castledental.com and newportdental.com.

## Our Privacy Pledge

Our privacy pledge to you is this: we will not share any private information that personally identifies you ("personal information") with any third party, unless we have your consent.

The only exceptions to this pledge are that we reserve the right to disclose personal information to protect our rights or property, to enforce our Terms of Use Agreement, or as required by operation of law or the request of government regulators or other law enforcement officials and the courts (including the issuance of a valid subpoena). We shall have no duty to notify you of such compliance with the law.

## What information do we collect, and how can you access it?

We learn certain information about you from your visit to the web site and what we do with this information depends on what you do when you are visiting the site. This policy explains the uses we currently make of this information. This policy lets you know what choices, access and security you have with respect to the information that is collected.

Unless you register and create a profile, send us an e-mail, or use chat rooms and forums or other products and services that are or will be available on the web site, we collect and store only the following information about you: the domain from which you accessed the Internet, the date and time you access the site, and the pages you visit most frequently. This information is not linked to a user name unless you give us one. We use the information to measure the number of visitors to various portions of our service and to help us improve our service. Our site will use cookies if you have chosen the option on your browser. Cookies help us customize and improve the site for you. You do not have to accept cookies to use the web site; however, if you disable cookies, our web site will not remember your customizations and cannot help you find what you want on the site most easily. If you accept cookies, you can delete them later by going to the preferences, tools or options menus of your browser.

If you do register and create a profile, create a user name and password, send us an e-mail, or use the chat rooms and forums or other products and services that will be available on the web site, we will collect and store the information you enter. Obviously, what we collect depends upon what you enter. You can edit your profile by clicking Account. You can delete your profile by simply deleting all the data fields, which will cause our server to delete the information from its online form. We reserve the right to keep all information in an off-line form, for archival purposes or as otherwise required by law.

## How is this information used?

If you do not consent to permit us to share your personal information with third parties, we will use that information only to track your visits to our web site, which enables us to learn more about what you, specifically, and our customers, in general, are expecting from our service.

If you do consent to allow us to share your personal information with third parties, we will only use that information according to the consent you give. We may use aggregate data (information about our base of users in general, from which all personally-identifying information has been removed) for any purpose.

Note that certain links on our web pages will take you off this web site to web pages operated by third parties. We will have no control over the information you enter or the cookies your browser accepts while on third parties' sites. You should examine the terms of service and privacy policies of other web pages whenever you leave one of the web sites.

## Security

When we use personal information gathered through the Brightnow, Monarchdental or Castledental sites we will do so only subject to this Online Privacy Policy. When we share personal information with third parties, we will require the third parties to enter confidentiality obligations similar to this policy or other appropriate confidentiality obligations (including but not limited to professional duties). We currently use Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to encrypt and protect the transmission of users' information and communications over the Internet.

NOTE, however, that e-mail does not provide a means for secure and private communications. If you send us an e-mail, your e-mail, like most non-encrypted Internet e-mail communications, may be accessed and viewed without your knowledge or permission while in transit to us. If you consider the information you are communicating to be confidential, please do not use e-mail. As an alternative, you may contact us by telephone at the numbers provided for various locations on our web site. If you choose to communicate confidential information to us via e-mail, by pressing the "send" button, you acknowledge that you are transmitting information to us which may be intercepted by third parties and are authorizing us to respond to you by e-mail.

We will make reasonable efforts to use the latest security technologies to ensure that the information its users provide is secure. However, we would like to remind its users that technology is no substitute for common sense. For this reason, we strongly encourage users to keep their login names and passwords secret and to change their password when they think they have become compromised. Furthermore, we recommend that our users communicate over secure channels wherever possible, disable the automatic login features found in some browsers, and empty their browser caches regularly.

## Children

We support and comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and other laws and we do not knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13, nor do we share such information with third parties. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to register and create a profile at [brightnow.com](http://www.brightnow.com/), [monarchdental.com](http://www.monarchdental.com/) or [castledental.com](http://www.castledental.com/)
