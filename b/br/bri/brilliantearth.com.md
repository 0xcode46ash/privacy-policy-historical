# Brilliant Earth: Security Policy & Privacy Policy

Secure Shopping 

At Brilliant Earth, complete security for customer transactions is our primary concern. With these measures in place, you can be confident in the security of the Brilliant Earth website.

**SSL Encryption**

When we transfer sensitive personal information such as credit card information over the Internet, we protect it using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology, the industry standard method for computers to communicate securely without risk of manipulation or recipient impersonation. We utilize this encryption during the online checkout process, including the acceptance of your credit card information.

We are registered with Verisign, the leader in digital authentication services and products for electronic commerce and other forms of secure communications. With Verisign, you can be assured that you have a secure communication with Brilliant Earth.

**Payment Options**

To give you flexibility and help you feel comfortable, we offer you a choice of options for payment of your purchases.

**Credit Card**

We are able to process approval of your credit card within 24 hours, which expedites the transfer of funds and minimizes the delay of shipment. We obtain credit card authorization from the card-issuing bank and employ other verification techniques before completing any transaction. We will not store your credit card or payment information after your transaction with Brilliant Earth is completed.

**Telephone**

If you prefer not to use your credit card over the Internet, you can give us a call at 800-691-0952 to place your order, or follow the instructions from Your Shopping Bag to complete your order via telephone. It is our pleasure to have one of our experienced representatives assist you.

**Signature Requirements for Delivery**

For your protection, Brilliant Earth insures and registers all items for their full value. Brilliant Earth requires that all deliveries must be made to a physical business or home address only - we do not ship to P.O. Box addresses. We also require an adult to sign for the delivery.

Brilliant Earth Privacy Guarantee 

Your privacy is very important to us. This privacy policy explains what information Brilliant Earth collects, why we collect this information and how we use the information we collect.

Brilliant Earth encourages you to periodically review this policy to learn how we are protecting your information. If you have questions or concerns about our privacy policy, please contact the Brilliant Earth customer service department at [info@brilliantearth.com](mailto:info@brilliantearth.com?subject=Question%20about%20privacy%20policy) or 800-691-0952.

**How we collect and use information**

You can browse our Web Site without providing any personally identifiable information about yourself. Personally identifiable information means any information that may be used to identify an individual, including, but not limited to, a first and last name; home, billing or other physical address; an email address; phone number or other contact information; or a credit card number and expiration date. When you submit your personally identifiable information to us, you are giving us your consent to the collection, use and disclosure of your personally identifiable information as set forth in this privacy policy.

As a policy, Brilliant Earth does not sell, trade or rent your personally identifiable information to third-parties, unless you have granted us permission to do so.

**Communications:** If you provide Brilliant Earth with personally identifiable information, this information may be used to provide you with information regarding Brilliant Earth and its products and services. For example, we may communicate to you information regarding promotions, surveys, contests, sweepstakes or product or service updates. Your personally identifiable information may also be used to improve and customize our Web Site's content, layout and services. These uses improve and customize our interactions with you.

If you contact a customer service representative or jewelry consultant and provide personally identifiable information to the consultant or submit a request through our Web Site, we will use your information to respond to your request and to provide you with additional information that we believe may be helpful to you.

In addition to the uses set forth above, if you place an order with Brilliant Earth, we will use your personally identifiable information to confirm your order, prevent and detect fraud or abuse, respond to your requests or inquiries, provide you with other administrative information regarding your order and provide you with any other information we believe may be helpful to you.

If you do not want to receive certain communications from Brilliant Earth you may elect to opt-out of receiving such communications; please see the "Choice/Opt-Out" section below for more information.

**Internal Use:** We may compare and review your personally identifiable information for errors, omissions and accuracy. We may also use your personally identifiable information internally to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, Web Site content and product offerings. Your personally identifiable information may also be used internally to conduct internal research on our users' demographics, interests, behavior and generally to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of our Web Site and our marketing programs.

**Compliance with Law and Fraud Protection:** We may collect and disclose any information, including personally identifiable information, we deem necessary, in our sole discretion, to comply with any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request. We may collect and possibly share personally identifiable information and any other information available to us in order to investigate, prevent or take action regarding illegal activities, including suspected fraud, or as otherwise required by law. We may also exchange information, including personally identifiable information, with other companies and organizations for credit fraud protection and risk reduction.

**Partners, Affiliates, and Service Providers:** We may share your personally identifiable information with authorized third party partners, agents and contractors. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company. Examples of other third parties that we may share your personal information with include: webhosting companies, fulfillment companies (e.g., companies that fulfill product orders), loose diamond suppliers, jewelers, assemblers, data analysis firms, affiliates, third party consulting or marketing firms and e-mail service providers. Additionally, if you use a credit card or other financing alternative to place an order with Brilliant Earth, to confirm and process your order we will share your personally identifiable information with the credit card company or financing company. These third parties only receive personally identifiable information if such information is needed to perform their function(s), and they are not authorized to use any personally identifiable information for any other purpose(s) other than the purpose(s) set forth by Brilliant Earth. We only provide third-parties with the minimum amount of personally identifiable information necessary to complete the requested service, product or transaction.

**Feedback and Testimonials:** If you provide feedback or testimonials on the Web Site or on Brilliant Earth products or services, we may post this feedback or testimonial, including personally identifiable information, on the Web Site or in marketing and promotional materials. We may, by our sole discretion, edit feedback or testimonials for length and content.

**Special Events:** If you choose to participate in a special event (for example, a promotion, contest or sweepstake), Brilliant Earth may share your personally identifiable information with those organizations participating in the applicable event. Typically, these third parties do not use your information for any other purpose other than to manage the event. In some cases these third-party partners may send you promotional materials regarding their products and services. In these cases, you will be given the opportunity to opt-out, and not have your personally identifiable information shared with that third-party partner.

**Send an item to a Friend / Refer a Friend:** When you e-mail a product to a friend or refer a friend, we request that you provide names and e-mail addresses for you and your friend. This ensures that your friend will know that you have requested that Brilliant Earth send them an e-mail. You and your friend's e-mail addresses will only be used for this purpose unless permission is otherwise granted.

**Business Transfer:** Your personally identifiable information may be disclosed as part of any merger, sale of company assets or acquisition, as well as in the event of an insolvency, bankruptcy or receivership, in which personally identifiable information would be transferred as one of the business assets of the Company.

**International Transfer:** Your personally identifiable information may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Brilliant Earth or its partners, affiliates, service providers, subsidiaries or agents maintain facilities and by using this Web Site, you consent to any such transfer of information outside of your country.
