**FlatBurger Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy is effective as of April 23, 2007.

FlatBurger empowers software marketplaces by linking software sellers (“ ** _Partners_** ”) and software buyers (“ ** _Buyers_** ”) through a unique services and technology platform combining code protection, licensing, quality certification, feedback, catalog, and e-commerce management features (the “ ** _Service_** ”). FlatBurger also partners with certain distributors and affiliates (“ ** _Affiliates_** ”) so that Partners may take advantage of the licensing and code protection technologies that FlatBurger offers while distributing software for download via other channels. Providing such a service necessarily requires FlatBurger to collect certain information about you and your Web browsing sessions. Because we at FlatBurger understand the importance of safeguarding your privacy, we take this responsibility very seriously. We are providing the following Privacy Policy to inform you of our policies and procedures for collection, use, and disclosure of any information about you that is collected from you during your use of flatburger.com (“ ** _Site_** ”) that, on its own or in combination with other identifiers, can be used to contact or identify you and any information that is stored or used in association with such identifying information (“ ** _Personal Information_** ”). For the purpose of this Privacy Policy, Personal Information does not include your IP address. We explain how we will use your IP address in more detail below.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any material changes to our Privacy Policy by posting the new policy on the Site 30 days prior to the material change to the privacy policy. We suggest that you consult the Site regularly to check for any changes to this Privacy Policy. 

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at [**_privacy@flatburger.com_**](mailto:privacy@flatburger.com).

We use your Personal Information primarily to provide and improve the Service. We also use your Personal Information when you contact us for technical support and to better understand how our Site and Service are used, as further explained below. 

Prior to buying or selling software via the Service, downloading FlatBurger white papers, or actively participating in the FlatBurger forums or blogs, you must register for a FlatBurger account. During registration, we request the following information: name, email address, user ID, display name, account password, website URL, city, state/province, country, company name, and occupation. FlatBurger will use that information to provide the Service. If you are a Buyer or Seller, FlatBurger may collect additional Personal Information, as set forth in the “Buyers” and “Partners” sections below.

In some cases, we collect Personal Information from you if you have not created an account, or have not signed in to your account. If you ask to join the FlatBurger email list in order to receive electronic newsletters or similar information, we will collect your email address. FlatBurger will use email addresses collected in this context to send you such information. We will not share your email address with third parties nor send you marketing or advertising messages at that address (unless you have provided us with that same email address in connection with a registered account and have expressly agreed to receive such messages). We also collect your email address and that of a third party when you use our Tell-A-Friend service (See “Tell-A-Friend” below). In addition, for all visitors to the Site—registered or not—FlatBurger collects certain Site Usage Data (defined below). 

## Tell-A-Friend 

If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. FlatBurger stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, and tracking the success of our referral program. 

Your friend may contact us at [_privacy@flatburger.com_](mailto:privacy@flatburger.com) to request that we remove this information from our database.
