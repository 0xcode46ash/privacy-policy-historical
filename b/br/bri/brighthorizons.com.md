**Who does Bright Horizons share personally identifiable information with?** Bright Horizons considers your personal information confidential and does not sell it to others. However, there are limited circumstances that require Bright Horizons to share it with others. 

Your Employer (if Applicable): Bright Horizons services are often made available to you as a benefit through employer sponsored programs. In order to meet our contractual obligations to our corporate clients, Bright Horizons will provide information about the utilization of these services by you to your employer. 

Agents and Service Providers: We sometimes employ or contract with other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf, such as supporting our systems infrastructure, providing recruiting services, and supporting our call centers. These parties are under a legal obligation to use your personal information as solely provided in the contractual services to Bright Horizons. 

Business Transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy assets. If any Bright Horizons business unit is sold or substantially all of Bright Horizons is acquired, personal information relevant to the operation sold could be one of the transferred assets. 

Legal Requirements: We may share personally identifiable information with law enforcement or other entities as required by law or as we reasonably determine to be necessary to protect our rights or the rights of others, to prevent harm to persons or property, to fight fraud, or to enforce our web site terms of use. 

How can individuals access or update their personally identifiable information? To exercise your rights to access and make appropriate changes or deletions to personally identifiable information we have gathered about you: 

If you have established an online user account with Bright Horizons, you may log onto your account to access and update your information. 

You may contact directly the entity (i.e. the Center where your child is enrolled) that stores or process your personally identifiable information to access and update it. Bright Horizons may require you to make your access and update requests in writing and to verify your identity. You may contact us at the address/telephone number/email address provided below. 

**How does Bright Horizons protect your personal information?** Bright Horizons places a high priority on the security of your information and have implemented numerous measures to secure it. We utilize appropriate technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, misuse, modification and improper disclosure. Bright Horizons securely stores the information you enter on its websites, including registration and payment information and your account password. However, no computer system or information can ever be fully protected against every possible hazard. As a result we cannot guarantee the security and privacy of the information you provide to us. 

You also play a valuable part in security. Your password to access your registration information should never be shared with anyone and should be changed frequently. After you have finished using our site, you should log out and exit your browser to prevent unauthorized users from returning to your online Bright Horizons account. If you believe that someone has improperly used or provided information about you that you did not authorize, please contact us immediately in one of ways provided below.

**Will this Privacy Policy change?** This privacy policy is subject to change and Bright Horizons will post revisions on this site. Please check back periodically, and especially before you provide any personally identifiable information. This Privacy Policy was last updated on March 11, 2008. What are the Terms and Conditions to use Bright Horizons’ Websites? 

**Use by Children:** Bright Horizons websites are intended for adults. Please do not use any of our websites if you are not yet 18 years old or lack the legal authority to form legally binding contracts. Bright Horizons does not solicit or knowingly collect any information from visitors under 18 years of age. 

**Consent:** By accessing or using any of Bright Horizons websites, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and accepted the practices described in this privacy policy. Please read this privacy policy carefully and be aware that we may change it at any time. As a result, we recommend that you check back regularly to this page to be apprised of any updates of changes. 

**Active Information Collection:** Like many websites, this site actively collects information from its visitors both by asking you specific questions and by permitting you to communicate directly with us via e-mail, feedback forms, and/or chat rooms. Some of the information that you submit may be personally identifiable information (that is, information that can be uniquely identified with you, such as your full name, address, e-mail address, phone number, and so on). Some areas of this site may require you to submit information in order for you to benefit from the specified features (such as newsletter subscriptions, tips/pointers, order processing) or to participate in a particular activity (such as sweepstakes or other promotions). You will be informed at each information collection point what information is required and what information is optional. 

Passive Information Collection: As you navigate through a website, certain information can be passively collected (that is, gathered without you actively providing the information) using various technologies and means, such as Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection. 

This site may use Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. An IP Address is a number assigned to your computer by your Internet service provider so you can access the Internet and is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information, because in most cases an IP address is dynamic (changing each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static (unique to a particular user's computer). We use your IP address to diagnose problems with our server, report aggregate information, determine the fastest route for your computer to use in connecting to our site, and administer and improve the site. 

A "cookie" is a bit of information that a website sends to your web browser that helps the site remember information about you and your preferences. "Session" cookies are temporary bits of information that are erased once you exit your Web browser window or otherwise turn your computer off. Session cookies are used to improve navigation on websites and to collect aggregate statistical information. This site uses session cookies. "Persistent" cookies are more permanent bits of information that are placed on the hard drive of your computer and stay there unless you delete the cookie. Persistent cookies store information on your computer for a number of purposes, such as retrieving certain information you have previously provided (e.g., passwords), helping to determine what areas of the Web site visitors find most valuable, and customizing the Web site based on your preferences. This site uses persistent cookies. "Internet tags" (also known as single-pixel GIFs, clear GIFs, invisible GIFs, and 1-by-1 GIFs) are smaller than cookies and tell the website server information such as the IP address and browser type related to the visitor's computer. This site uses Internet tags. Tags have been placed both on online advertisements that bring people to the site and on different pages of the site. These tags indicate how many times a page is opened and which information is consulted. We do not collect or seek personally identifiable information through these tags. 

"Navigational data" ("log files," "server logs," and "clickstream" data) are used for system management, to improve the content of the site, market research purposes, and to communicate information to visitors. This site uses navigational data. 

Links to Other Sites: This site may contain links or references to other websites. Please be aware that we do not control other websites and that and this privacy policy does not apply to those websites. We encourage you to read the privacy policy of every website you visit. Other Terms: Your use of this site is subject to our [Legal Notice](https://web.archive.org/web/20081219151525id_/http%3A//www.brighthorizons.com/home/legal.aspx). Updated March 11, 2008
