**PRIVACY POLICY**

Parka, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Parka”) has created this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) in order to disclose our information gathering and dissemination practices for this website(“Website”).  We will not sell or share any personal information about you to or with any person or organization except as provided in this Privacy Policy. References in this Agreement to “we,” “us” or “our” mean Parka (and its successors and assigns) and references to “you” and “your” mean the user.

Parka will:

  * **Never** store your website passwords without your knowledge
  * **Never** alter your website without your explicit permission
  * **Never** collect data other than as set out in this Privacy Policy
  * **Always** treat your information with care



For each visitor to our Website, our server may automatically recognize your domain name and other information.  We do not require anyone to provide us with personally identifiable information to view the Website.

**_Identifiable & Other Information_**

You may, in the course of using our Website, choose to provide us with identifiable information.  The identifiable information that we may collect includes, but is not limited to, the following: company name; website; first and last name of a company contact person; email address; phone number; address; zip code; and last four digits of your last used credit card (if applicable) (“identifiable information”).  Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we may store and retain all information provided by you in our data servers.

We may also collect the following information: WordPress version; BruteProtect version; number of sites in your multisite network (if applicable); the IP addresses of those who fail to log in successfully without your permission.

**_Cookies & Technical Information_**

We also collect information automatically through the use of electronic tools. We may log the name of your Internet service provider, IP address, or use “cookie” technology for account registration, login features, form submissions, localization, personalization, and to store your preferences and record session information. Additionally, cookies may be used by third-party solutions for the purpose of analytics and performance and by social media services.  As we adopt additional technology, we may also gather information through other means. In certain cases, you can choose not to provide us with information by setting your browser to refuse to accept cookies, but be aware that doing so may limit your ability to access certain portions of the Website.

Additionally, we may use log files to track how the Website is being accessed and used. Log files track anonymous user information such as IP addresses, browser types, Internet service providers, referring and exit pages, platform type, date and time stamps, and number of clicks to, from, and within the Website.  Finally, if you arrive at the Website through a referral device such as a banner ad, we may track how you arrived at the Website, including any clicks that might have impacted our servers.

**Use of Information  
**We will not sell your identifiable information to any third party for any purpose.

We sometimes share personal information given to us with third parties. For instance, there may be third party service providers for our operations or business activities, with whom we have an agreement for services who transmit, store, analyze or otherwise use such personal information in connection with their services to us.  Additionally, from time to time, we may use personal information for new, unanticipated uses not previously disclosed in our Privacy Policy.  If our information practices change at some time in the future, we will only use data collected from the time of the policy change forward for these new purposes.  Further, we use the technical information collected from cookies and other sources described above to study how the Website is being used and to improve the Website.  We may also use cookies to track your preferences so that when you return to our Website, you can navigate more easily without having to re-enter certain information.

We also collect information as we deem may be reasonably necessary for tracking/verifying compliance with federal, state and local laws.  We may disclose your personal information in response to a court order, when we reasonably believe we are required to do so by law and/or whenever we deem it appropriate or necessary to give such information to law enforcement authorities.  Additionally, we reserve the right to transfer personal information to a successor in interest that acquires rights to the information as a result of the sale of Parka.  Please note that we will not provide you with notice prior to disclosure in such cases.
