**  
PRIVACY NOTICE**

The notice is being provided in accordance with the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, a Federal law which requires all cable operators to notify subscribers of the collection, use and disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding cable subscribers.   
Blue Ridge Communications collects and maintains certain information concerning individual subscribers, which is necessary to provide cable television service to our subscribers and to detect unauthorized reception of our service. Such information includes billing records, service maintenance and repair records, premium service subscription, marketing and research survey information and subscriber complaints.  
We do not maintain this information any longer than is necessary for our business purposes. Information such as credit references, previous address, social security and driver license numbers are maintained for purpose of identity regarding the applicants for our services, credit checks and collection purposes. After such time, if the purpose for which such information was collected has been accomplished, Blue Ridge Communications will destroy the information.  
 

As a subscriber, you may review (and correct if necessary) any personal information held by us that pertains to you. These records are available at the local Blue Ridge Communications office serving you, during the hours of 9 AM to 5 PM, Monday through Friday. We request that you contact us beforehand by telephone or letter so that we may locate the information and set up an appointment for your review.

CONSUMER EDUCATION**

Some older TV sets and VCRs do not have enough channel capacity to provide all of the channels we make available. A converter may be necessary to view these channels. The converter does not need to have  
descrambling capabilities. When using any cable converter you may not be able to benefit from some of the special functions of your TV set and VCR.  For example: to view one channel while recording another;  
to watch and record two different TV shows at the same time; to use use advanced picture generation and display features such as “picture in picture.” Converters are available from local retailers or directly from Blue Ridge Communications.If Blue Ridge Communications has provided you with a remote control for use with a converter or other device, please be advised that compatible remote controls are available from retail outlets.  
Many remotes designated as “universal remotes” will operate the converter boxes.  You may contact your local Blue Ridge Communications office for advice prior to purchasing a remote control. Digital customers: Instructions for parental controls are located at <http://www.brctv.com/support/parental-control> and in your welcome packet. Analog customers can find parental control instructions in the remote control manual. We recommend that you set up a PIN to prevent accidental or unauthorized purchases.
