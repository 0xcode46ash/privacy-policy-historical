This privacy statement is designed to help you understand how Thomson Reuters Professional Publishing (“we”) may collect and use personal information about you as a client, or potential client, of our products and services.

This privacy statement applies to any personal information provided to us, including personal information provided to us by a third party partner or that you provided to us, including via Thomson Reuters Professional Publishing's websites, including: [www.ifre.com](http://www.ifre.com/), [www.ifrasia.com](http://www.ifrasia.com/), [www.buyoutsnews.com](http://www.buyoutsnews.com/), [www.breakingviews.com](http://www.breakingviews.com/), [www.pfie.com](http://www.pfie.com/) and [www.vcjnews.com](http://www.vcjnews.com/). These Web Sites provide direct links to other web sites. This privacy statement does not apply to those web sites. Before disclosing personal information on any other company’s web site, you should read the privacy statement associated with that web site.

Any information you may provide to our customer support services, whether directly or through one of our Web Sites, will be covered by this privacy statement. That information may include any personal contact information and business-sensitive information such as system information, search strategies and problem descriptions we may need to provide assistance and information to you.

#### What information about you do we collect?

When you visit our Web Sites, you may provide us with two types of information: (1) personally identifiable information that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is collected on an individual basis, and (2) general user information that does not contain personally identifiable information, which is collected on an aggregate basis as you browse the Web Sites. In some cases, if you choose not to provide us with requested information, you may not be able to access all of our Web Site's content or services.

**Personally identifiable information you choose to provide**  
We may ask for certain personal information from you for the purpose of providing to you content and/or services that you request. For example, if you indicate an interest in receiving materials, you are asked to submit your name, institution and e-mail address, which we retain on file, so that we may send you the information that you requested. We also request your name and e-mail address and other contact details each time you contact us by clicking on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) link. We may retain a record of users who have contacted us in order to respond properly to questions or concerns and for purposes of future communications.

**Non-personally identifiable information we collect**  
Cookies/Web server logs: Similar to other commercial Web sites, our Web Sites utilizes standard technology called "cookies" and Web server logs to collect information about how our Web Sites are used. Cookies are a feature of Web browser software that allows Web servers to recognize the computer used to access a Web site. Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored by a user's Web browser on the user's hard drive. Information gathered through cookies and Web server logs may include the date and time of visits, the pages viewed, time spent at our Web Sites, and the Web sites visited just before and just after our Web Site. This information is collected on an aggregate basis. None of this information is associated with you as an individual.

You can, of course, disable cookies on your computer by indicating this in the preferences or options menus in your browser. However, it is possible that some parts of our Web Sites will not operate correctly if you disable cookies. You should consult with your browser's provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.

#### How do we use the information we collect?

We use your personally identifiable information to provide you with the information or content that you have requested. In some cases, we may contact you about our programs, features or services. If you no longer wish to receive communications from Thomson Reuters Professional Publishing, you may opt out by sending us an email through a [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) link on one of our websites or calling us at +44 (0)20 7369 7454. We use non-identifying information collected on our Web Sites in the aggregate to better understand your use of the Web Sites and to enhance your enjoyment and experience. For example, we may use the information to improve the design and content of our Web Sites or to analyze the programs and services that we offer.

**Additional disclosure of your information:**  
We may provide access to your personally identifiable information when legally required to do so, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of our Web Sites, to limit our legal liability and protect our rights, or to protect the rights and safety of visitors to our Web Sites or the public. In those instances, the information is provided only for that limited purpose.

We may employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Our agents and contractors who have access to your personally identifiable information are required to protect the information in a similar manner that is consistent with this privacy statement.

We will not share your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to those described above without providing you with an opportunity to opt out of such use or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

#### How do you access and/or modify your information or chioces?

You may modify, update or delete information we hold on you at any time or update your preferences regarding what information you want to receive from us by clicking on the [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) link or calling +44 (0)20 7369 7454. When supplying personal information using one of the online forms on the Web Sites, you have the option to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional material relating to our products and services. However, please be aware that your ability to opt out from receiving marketing and promotional materials does not change our right to contact you regarding your use of our Web Sites or subscriptions you may have ordered either for trial or purchase. 

#### Consent to tranfers

The Web Sites are operated in the United Kingdom. If you are located outside of the United Kingdom please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to the United Kingdom. By using our Web Sites, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer. The information you provide may also be transferred to other parts of the Thomson Reuters Professional Publishing Group outside of the United Kingdom in order to provide the information or service you have requested. All reasonable care will be taken to ensure data security and adherence to these privacy practices. 

#### Links

Our Web Sites contain links to third party sites as well as to other sites owned and/or operated by Thomson Reuters. Please be aware that Thomson Reuters is not responsible for the privacy practices of any third party sites. Please also be aware that the privacy policies of other Thomson Reuters sites may differ significantly from the privacy policy of our Web Sites. Therefore, we encourage our users to read the privacy statement of each and every Web site that collects personally identifiable information. This Privacy Statement applies solely to information collected by our Web Sites.

#### How to contact us

For further details on any items associated with this policy or the Web Sites, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us). 

#### Changes to the policy

From time to time, we may change our privacy policies. If we make a change, it will not affect the choices you have made about any information you gave us before that change. Any changes will be reflected in our Privacy Statements. 

#### Complaints

We are committed to working with you to resolve, quickly and fairly, any complaints you may have about privacy. If you have any questions or comments, please [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/contact-us) or call us at +44 (0)20 7369 7454. 

#### Data Security

We take reasonable steps to maintain the security of the personally identifiable information that we collect, including limiting the number of people who have physical access to our database servers, as well as installing electronic security systems that guard against unauthorized access. However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Accordingly, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to us, so you do so at your own risk.
