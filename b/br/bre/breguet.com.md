We also use other technologies on our Website which allow us and Third Party Providers to offer you a more personalized and engaged web experience, e.g. by offering you advertisements on your social media channels that are more relevant to you or by allowing you to share your experiences on our Website via social media. We therefore use the following technologies:

  * \- **Facebook pixels**. Facebook pixels are small pieces of software and are nearly invisible pixel-sized “dots” on our Website which create a link between your visit to our Website and Facebook. When the pixel loads, Facebook places a so-called “fr”-cookie on your computer, which helps Facebook to provide you with more personalized advertisements, but also to measure and improve advertisements. This cookie has a lifespan of 90 days. More information on Facebook cookies can be found here: <https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/>. Please note that when the “fr”-cookie is placed, Facebook is able to follow your surfing behavior across other websites which have implemented a Facebook pixel or Facebook social plug-in.
  * \- **Social plugins**. Social plug-ins are small pieces of software which create a link between your visit to our Website and the social media platform of a Third Party Provider. The social plug-in will let the Third Party Provider know that you have visited our Website and may let the Third Party Provider receive cookies he has placed on your computer beforehand. We use social plug-ins of the following Third Party Providers: 
    * Facebook (<https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins>)
    * Twitter (<https://dev.twitter.com/web/overview>)
    * LinkedIn (<https://developer.linkedin.com/plugins>)
