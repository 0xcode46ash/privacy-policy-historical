# breatheHR :: Privacy Policy

breatheHR is a service offered by Centurion Management Systems Ltd (CMSL)

CMSL respects the privacy and confidentiality our clients and users of our website who submit information of a nature that could be considered personal. In the general course of our business we collect information from users of our website in order to, amongst other things, supply additional information or demonstration versions of our software. The policies detailed below outline how we will use the information obtained and make every effort to comply with current UK and EU legislation including the Data Protection Act 1998.

### The Type Of Information We May Acquire From You, Your Consent

There are two kinds of information that we track from our users; non-specific information and specific personal information.

In the first case we track the non-specific information by IP address from which we cannot identify a user or any personal details. This information is used for us to identify popular web pages and amend content based on visitor profile history.

In the second case where a user has filled out a form to submit information including a name, e-mail address, telephone number and company we may use this information selectively, only within CMSL, to send out communications on an infrequent basis which we consider will be of interest. Generally communications will not be more than one item every three months with the aim to inform our users of developments with respect to our products and/or services. By submitting your information you consent to the use of that information as set out in this policy. If we change our privacy policy we will post the changes on this page, and may place notices on other pages of the website, so that you may be aware of the information we collect and how we use it at all times. If a user considers that, for any reason, they wish to no longer receive any information or would like to modify the information we have recorded then there are a number of choices to quickly and easily ensure that modifications are made.

Send an email to:[info@breathehr.com](mailto:info@breathehr.com)

If a user has subscribed to one of our e-mail newsletters and no longer wishes to receive it then they can reply to the email newsletter with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line or use any of the methods listed above.

### What Information Do We Share?

Infrequently there may be times when we are required to share the personal information we learn from you with other parties. However this will only be to our direct business partners including, but not limited to, suppliers and government bodies. We will not sell or rent this information to others. In the event of a sale, merger or acquisition of CMSL to another company or of another company by CMSL we reserve the right to share our information with our professional advisers and the new company or companies. We will adhere to the policies above and continue to use the information selectively and sensitively respecting the privacy of our users.

### How we protect your information

The internet is not a secure medium. However we have put in place various security procedures to keep your information confidential. The internal procedures of CMSL cover the storage, access and disclosure of your information.

### General

Where there are links from this website to other websites, CMSL emphasises that it has no control over these sites, their content or the way in which they collect or use personal data. CMSL therefore strongly advises users to check the privacy policy of any site they visit. CMSL is committed to ensuring privacy. We want our users to feel comfortable with their experience on our website and we would appreciate any feedback they may have to offer. If there are any questions about this privacy statement, the practices of this site, or dealings with this website, please contact our webmaster - [info@breathehr.com](mailto:info@breathehr.com)

Finally whilst we will use all reasonable efforts to ensure that this document reflects our current policy we do reserve the right to change our policy from time to time.
