# BrowserCam : Privacy

Our Privacy Policy

> Our privacy policy is simple: We won't sell your name to anyone. We won't share any capture data with anyone.
> 
> We cookie you for session management only. If you click "remember me", the cookie is persistent. Otherwise it goes away when you close your browser.

What About My Data?

> When you close your account, all of your billing information is completely deleted from our database. All of your project data, screen captures, zip files, PSD's and everything else created by using the service is also deleted. All sub-accounts are deleted. We keep your name and email in case we have to follow up with you for some _very specific_ reason -- like you requested a refund and closed your account (thus deleting your credit card info) before we could issue one. Otherwise, we will not contact you ever again unless absolutely necessary.
> 
> Candidly, however your data is still on our backup tapes. So although it would be a pain, we _could_ recover it. Here's the deal. We are on a five tape rotation. That means that six weeks after you close your account the last of the backups with your personal information is overwritten. At that point, your deleted information is irrecoverably gone forever. How's that for a candid privacy policy?  
  
Fair Use Policy

> We reserve the right to cancel your service at anytime without warning if we feel you are abusing the service. If we do, we will refund all of your money, close your account and send you a note. In the last two years we have had to do it exactly once. Please just show a little consideration for the fact that BrowserCam is a shared resource and other designers just like you are trying to use the service too.
