We do not collect any _personal information_ about you unless you provide that information voluntarily by sending e-mail or completing an online form.  This policy is consistent with the provisions of the Internet Security and Privacy Act, the Freedom of Information Law, and the Personal Privacy Protection Law.

None of the above-mentioned information is deemed to constitute _personal information_ by the [Internet Privacy and Security Act ](http://www.oft.state.ny.us/policy/OFTEnablingLeg.htm).

We do not knowingly collect _personal information_ from children under the age of 13 or create profiles of children under the age of 13.  _Users_ are cautioned, however, that the collection of _personal information_ submitted by e-mail or online form will be treated as though it was submitted by an adult, and may, unless exempted from access by federal or State law, be subject to public access.
