# LTDnetwork - The family of online shopping sites you can trust.

**  
**  
**Prelude**

You will notice that compared to other internet rewards/loyalty programs, our privacy statement is quite brief. This is for a very good reason. The personal information you volunteer is used only to track, aggregate and provide you with your Loyalty Token Dollars (LTD's).

We cannot stress strongly enough that the information you provide us is an important part of our business, and as such we will not sell or rent your Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to any third-party. 

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII)**

If you are simply perusing our site and have not registered as a member of the LTDnetwork, we do not store any PII either on our websites or our servers. Your PII stored on your own computer, can be accessed by our proprietary software for the purpose of merchant-payment fulfillment and LTD tracking.

**What we collect**

We collect the following personal information about you upon registration: name, address, age, date of birth, gender, interests, and important dates and occasions.  
Some of this information must be provided, whilst some is optional.

In order for you to benefit from the SurfAssist software and accumulate Loyalty Token Dollar's, the SurfAssist software installed on your machine. When activated, SurfAssist monitors your online activities, such as the sites you are visiting, when and how long you visit the sites and the links that you click on to get there. This statistical information is collected via the use of cookies, which are tiny and safe packets of information that reside on your computer. 

**How we protect your information**

LTDnetwork is dedicated to the security of your PII, and we take every commercially reasonable precaution to maintain that protection. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, maintain data accuracy, and facilitate the appropriate use of information, your PII is stored on your own computer.  
In addition, encryption tools are used when collecting or transferring sensitive information such as credit card numbers. Additional database content is protected either by means of a two key encryption algorithm or behind a firewall using security software.

**Corrections & Updates to Personal Information**

Visitors can change or correct information about themselves using the online forms which are part of our registration system. If there is a problem with a change being accepted by our system, you may contact us at the email address: talk2us@LTDnetwork.

**Advertising & Merchants**

As part of our business model, we insert banner advertisements on our pages. You should be aware of the following:

  * Some of these ads are provided by outside companies. 
  * These ads may contain cookies. Cookies attached to banner ads are managed by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. To the best of our knowledge, these cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about You.
  * For reporting purposes, our advertisers, their agents and we produce aggregate statistical reports. For example, how many people saw or clicked on an ad and additionally, how many people saw or clicked on ads in different portions of our service. Again, to the best of our knowledge neither advertisers nor their agents are able discern actual individual users of the site. We definitely do not record PII and all our statistics are generic and anonymous. 



Also as part of our business model we refer customers to the web site/s of Merchants with which we are affiliated. In some circumstances, we might share PII with our affiliated Merchants.

**Children's Privacy**

This statement discloses the privacy practices for portions of LTDnetwork directed at children under 13. LTDnetwork will NOT:

  * collect online contact information from a user under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent, which includes an opportunity for the parent to prevent use of the information and participation in the activity. When we do not obtain prior verifiable parental consent, online contact information will be used only to directly respond to the child's request and will not be used to contact the child for other purposes.
  * collect personally identifiable offline contact information from users under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
  * distribute to third parties any personally identifiable information collected from a child under 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.
  * give to children the ability to send e-mail, create personal web pages, participate in forums or kids chat rooms without prior verifiable parental consent.
  * entice a child under 13 by the prospect of a special game, prize or other activity, to divulge more information than is needed to participate in such activity. 
  * We will also place prominent notice wherever personally identifiable information is collected, requesting children to ask a parent for permission to proceed. 

**The following are details of the information we collect and how we use it:**

LTDnetwork collects data so that we may display personalized content to our visitors. This data may be analyzed so that we can customise our content and judge our system's performance. For instance, your computer reaches us via a particular IP, (InternetProtocol), address. This tells us from what part of the world your computer is connecting and what service provider you are using.

Your browser offers "cookies" which store small amounts of data on your computer about your child's visits to any of our sites. Cookies assist us in tracking which of our features your child likes best, so when your child re-visits our LTDnetwork sites, we can customize our content accordingly. However, cookies tell us nothing about your child personally, unless you or your child specifically give us additional information. 

Demographic information may be used to customize the display of our LTDnetwork sites to your child by showing content that we think might be of interest or related to the child's past visits.

Some of the banner ads displayed in our LTDnetwork sites are provided by outside companies. These ads may contain cookies. While we use cookies in other parts of our Web site, cookies received with banner ads are collected by our advertisers and we do not have access to this information. Cookies in and of themselves do not contain any personally identifiable information about your child.

The LTDnetwork Web site includes many topical areas that all users may access. By giving your verifiable consent to allow your child to use chat, forums, newsletters, and/or any other functionality of the LTDnetwork Web site in which your child may provide personally identifiable information, your child will have access other areas throughout the LTDnetwork Web site. Please monitor your child's use of other areas of the Web site which are not directed toward children.  
We produce aggregate reports for advertisers. For example, we tell advertisers how many people saw or clicked on an ad, and in which portions of our service. Where available, we may offer additional information about viewer characteristics. However, this does not include personally identifiable information or online usage patterns. Our advertisers allow us to provide our service to our users and our members. In return, they need to know how to effectively place their ads to potential customers.

We'll use email contact information to provide members with newsletters to which the member subscribed, or for similar information we think the member may find of interest. However, you can choose to discontinue your child's receipt of these mailouts.

**Give Us Your Feedback**

By using our web site, you consent to the collection and use of information as set forth in this privacy policy. You also acknowledge that while it is our right to change this policy, without prior notification, and our commitment to post any such changes on this page so that you are fully informed of the types of information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, it is disclosed.

Ultimately, our goal is to protect your privacy. To comment on or help us improve this privacy policy, please [contact us](https://web.archive.org/web/20020603071034id_/http%3A//www.ltdnetwork.com/contactus.asp).
