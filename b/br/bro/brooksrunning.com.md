## Your Privacy Choices

### Online Account Information

You may access, update and correct your online account information at any time by logging into your online account and updating your preferences.

We may also retain cached or archived copies of your information for a certain period of time.

### Location Information

If you initially consent to our collection of location information, you can subsequently stop the collection of this information at any time by changing the preferences on your mobile device. If you do so, our mobile applications, or certain features thereof, will no longer function.
