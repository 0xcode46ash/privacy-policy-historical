# BROADBAND SPORTS

We are as hard-core about protecting your privacy as we are in serving your sports interests.

Broadband Sports has created privacy policies to demonstrate our commitment to your privacy. The following discloses how we use information we collect from you. If you have any questions regarding this information or our privacy practices, please see the section entitled "Questions?" at the bottom of this page. 

**What information do we collect? How do we use it?**

All of the information you provide us is completely voluntary and you are not obligated to give us any personal information if you do not desire to do so.

We request that you give us contact information (like your name and e-mail address) when you register on our site, order products, fill out surveys or enter contests. We use this contact information in a variety of ways. We use it to send you information about our company and promotional material from some of our partners. You may opt out of receiving future mailings from us and our partners by following the steps in the section entitled "How do you opt out?" (below). We also use the contact information to process any orders you place on the site and to contact you when necessary.

We collect financial information (like your credit card number) when we need to bill you for products or services you order from us. We consider your financial information highly confidential and do not share your financial information with any third party that is not involved in fulfilling your order.

We collect demographic and profile information (like your zip code, favorite athlete, age and income level) to allow us to tailor your experience at our site. With this information, we can show you content we think you might be interested in and display the content according to your preferences. We share this information with our advertisers as well, but only on an aggregated basis (which means that none of your personally identifiable information is associated with the demographic information we give the advertisers).

We retain your IP address and use it to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer our site. Your IP address is also used to help identify you and your shopping cart and to gather broad demographic information.

We also add to the information you provide us with information from some of our partners to provide you with the best possible experience while visiting our site.

**How do we protect customer information?**

We have security measures in place to protect the loss, misuse and alteration of the information you provide us. Certain areas of the site such as user profile, login and store checkout are encrypted to secure information exchanged between your computer and our servers. We also have security technologies implemented to protect your information stored by our servers. 

**What about "cookies"?**

"Cookies" are small pieces of information that are stored by your browser on your computer's hard drive. We use cookies to keep track of your shopping cart and to make sure you don't see the same ad repeatedly. We also use cookies to deliver content specific to your interests, to save your password so you don't have to re-enter it each time you visit our site and for other similar purposes to maximize your enjoyment of our site. In addition, ads displayed on our site may contain cookies. Cookies received with banner ads are collected by our ad companies and we do not have access to this information. Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually change your browser to prevent that.

**How do you opt out? How do you change the information we have for you?**

We give you the opportunity to opt out of receiving communications from us and our partners. You may request that your information be removed from our database and that we do not send you future communications by:

You may also change or modify any information you previously provided us by using any of the methods above.

**Is there other privacy information you should know?**

Our site contains links to other sites that we do not control. We do not have information regarding the privacy practices of all of these sites and are not responsible for their privacy practices. Please make sure you are comfortable with the privacy practices of every site you visit before providing the site with your personal information.

We make chat rooms and message boards available to you. Please remember that we cannot control the information that is shared by users and that any information that is disclosed in these areas by you becomes public information.  Please exercise discretion and caution when deciding to disclose your personal information in these areas.
