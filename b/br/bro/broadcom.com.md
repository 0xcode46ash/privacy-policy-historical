During the course of your relationship with us, we may collect personal information to enable you to order products or services, download software updates, make requests and register for customized communications programs. We may collect such personal information as your name, contact and billing information, transaction and credit card information. To tailor our subsequent communications to you and improve our products and services, we may ask you to provide information regarding your personal or professional interests, demographics, experience with our products and contact preferences. Personal information may be required to determine access eligibility for certain restricted parts of our site. Data collected online may be combined with information provided offline.

Broadcom uses your personal information to better understand your needs and provide you with better service. Specifically, we use your personal information to help you complete a transaction, to communicate back to you, provide updates on service and benefits, and to personalize our websites and communications with you. Credit card numbers are used only for payment processing and are not retained for other purposes. From time to time, we may also use your information to contact you for market research or to provide you with marketing information we think would be of particular interest. We will always give you the opportunity to opt-out of receiving such contact. If you would like to read more about how to opt out, please follow the directions given below in the "Choice" section of this document. In addition, we will also follow local requirements where applicable.

#### Whom we share the information with

Broadcom does not sell, rent, or lease your personal information to others. Unless we have your permission or are required by law, we only share your personal information with other Broadcom entities or business partners who are acting on our behalf for the uses described above. Such Broadcom entities and business partners are governed by our privacy policies with respect to the use of this data and are bound by the appropriate confidentiality agreements.

  


### 2\. Choice

Broadcom will not use or share your personal information in ways unrelated to the ones described above without first notifying you and offering a choice. We will also provide you the opportunity to let us know if you wish to opt out at any time of certain or all contact from Broadcom, and we will do everything we can to honor such requests. This choice may be offered at the bottom of our online or offline communications to you as well as on many of our Web registration pages. If you have any difficulty exercising your choices, please send your request to <http://www.broadcom.com/contact/feedback.php>.

Your permission will always be secured first, should we ever decide to share your personal information with third parties that are not acting on our behalf and governed by our privacy policy.

  


### 3\. ONWARD TRANSFER

Subject to your permission or as permitted by law, the personal information that you provide to us may be transferred within Broadcom across state or country borders. This may be done to consolidate data storage or to simplify the management of customer information.

Broadcom strives to keep your personal information accurate. We will provide you with access to your personal information, including making every effort to provide you with online access to your registration data so that you may review, update or correct your information at the Broadcom site where it was submitted.

### 7\. TAILORING EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS AND WEB EXPERIENCES

On occasion, Broadcom may employ technologies that enable us to review which recipients have opened our email communications and which links they have accessed in the message.
