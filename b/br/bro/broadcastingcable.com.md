In addition, each of these communications will include instructions for opting out of receiving future third party offers from us.

Our Disclosure of Your Information

**

We will not disclose your information to anyone outside of RBI or other Reed Elsevier divisions, except as described in this section.

We may disclose aggregated anonymous statistics about many Users to advertisers, content and service providers and other affiliated and unaffiliated companies.

We sometimes engage third parties to perform services for us, including in connection with this Site, that require us to disclose Users’ Personally Identifiable Information to them. If we make any such disclosure, we will require such parties to keep the information confidential and to use it only to perform the services.

We also may disclose your information to third parties that wish to market products or services that may be of interest to you. We will require these parties to keep any Personally Identifiable Information provided by us confidential and use it only to market and provide their products or services or with your approval. When you register with and provide information to this Site, you will be given an opportunity to opt out of our disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information as described in this paragraph. You may also opt out of such disclosures at any time by sending an e-mail to [eletters@reedbusiness.com](mailto:eletters@reedbusiness.com) with the subject line **_"do not disclose."_**

 ** __**

The only other times we may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information collected on this Site are as follows:

  * In the event of an asset sale, merger, consolidation, restructuring, reorganization, liquidation or other similar transaction involving RBI or this Site, we may transfer some or all User information, including Personally Identifiable Information, to the successor company.


  * We will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information when we believe such disclosure is required by law or for the protection of persons or property.


  * We may disclose your Personally Identifiable Information with your consent, as well as when disclosure is necessary to accomplish the purpose for which you provide it. For example, when you request information from advertisers in the "Reader Services" section of our publications, we will disclose your Personally Identifiable Information to the advertisers you specify.

**

Security

**

We use reasonable security safeguards to protect Personally Identifiable Information we collect on this Site from unauthorized access, use, modification or disclosure. However, due to the design of the Internet and other factors outside of our control, we cannot guarantee that communications between you and our servers will be free from unauthorized access by third parties.

**

Right to Access and Change Information

**

You may view and update information that you previously submitted to this Site by visiting the registration page for this Site or sending an e-mail to [ privacymanager@reedbusiness.com](mailto:privacymanager@reedbusiness.com). However, a request to change information may not be accommodated if the request would conflict with legal requirements or result in incorrect information. Requests to view or change personal information may take a few days to process. ****

**** **

Opt-Out

**

This Privacy Policy describes certain opportunities you will have to opt out of our using or disclosing your Personally Identifiable Information.

Typically, an opt out request will be specific to a particular service or product. For example, if you opt out of receiving third party offers from this Site, you may continue to receive third party offers from other RBI web sites or publications not associated with this Site. Similarly, opting out of our disclosing Personally Identifiable Information collected on this Site will not apply to information collected on other RBI web sites. **** We cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate opt out requests that apply to multiple web sites, products or services, but we will try to do so to the extent feasible. If you wish to opt out of the use or disclosure of Personally Identifiable Information collected by more than one RBI web site, the best way of accomplishing this is to provide a separate opt out request for each web site, product or service. 

Any opt out request will only be effective after a reasonable period of time for processing.
