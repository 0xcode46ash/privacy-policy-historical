TVinsite is a publication of Reed Business Information.

This Privacy Policy will be continuously assessed against new technologies,  
business practices and our customers’ changing needs. We may change our  
privacy practices from time to time. If we make any changes, we’ll update this  
privacy statement accordingly (the date of the most recent change is displayed  
at the top of this statement). 

Many of our RBI publications are available free of charge or may be subscribed  
to at reduced rates because they are supported by advertisers. Qualification  
and registration questionnaires and other processes ensure that our  
advertisers reach the appropriate audiences. We may use the information we  
collect from you individually or aggregated with other user’s information to  
improve our publications, to customize these publications, and to notify you  
about updates or new features. In addition, we may use information we collect   
to notify you of third-party products and services in which you may be   
interested.

In addition to the options made available to you, if any, when we collect   
information, you may elect to 'opt out' of having your individually identifiable  
information shared with third-parties that are not affiliated with Reed  
(except for uses specifically requested by you and legitimate business uses).  
Separate third-party opt out request for each medium (mail or telephone or  
e-mail) must be submitted in writing to our Privacy Manager in one of the   
following ways:

Attention: Privacy Manager  
Reed Business Information  
2000 Clearwater Drive  
Oak Brook, IL 60523  
E-Mail: [privacymanager@reedbusiness.com](mailto:privacymanager@reedbusiness.com)   
Phone: (877) 504-1273  
Fax: (630) 288-8394

We will update the specific records related to your request as promptly as   
practical. Note, however, that you may receive   
additional communications from third parties after you submit your request  
while we process the request. Additionally, your information may exist in  
multiple lists within the company and our technology limits the processing of  
opt out requests to the specific list source. We will continuously assess our  
responsiveness to opt out requests against new technologies, business   
practices and our customers’ needs.
