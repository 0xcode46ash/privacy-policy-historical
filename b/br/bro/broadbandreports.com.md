In registration, BBR requires an email address. all other details are optional. 

At any time, you may remove your records from our user database, and receive confirmation by email that the data has been erased from our production systems.

Please note that contributions you make to the site (postings, reviews, news, and other writings), under our terms of use policy, are ours to use (delete, republish, modify) as we like. In case where these contributions are provided to third parties, aggregated or published, information sufficient to identify the original author will be removed, OR your permission to keep the identification with the material will be sought via an email to your registered user address.. In the case that your email address is not answered, or no longer valid, we consider any notification obligation we have relating to use of the material is discharged.

Upon your first login to BBR, We send a "cookie" to your computer. A cookie is a file that identifies you as a unique user. It can also store personal preferences and user data. A cookie tells us that you previously logged in sucessfully, and therefore gains you access to the site. Once our site knows who is visiting, it will present information to you in your choice of custom form. 

BBR uses a cookie to identify you with your registration details, and to track user trends and patterns.

Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies or indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, note that some parts of BBR may not function properly if you refuse cookies.

##  Ad serving 

Most banner ads are served by our own software. In some cases, double-click or other ad serving solutions may be used. No user information we keep is sent to any advertising partner or technology provider.

Registered users may elect to disable adverts completely.

##  Changes 

We reserve the right to make changes to this policy at any time. If the change involves a _reduction_ in privacy protection of any kind, a notice will be posted to our [site forum](https://web.archive.org/forum/beeble) explaining the change. Since the inception of BBR and the first version of the privacy policy, no such change has been made.
