  * to provide an availability check of specific services in your area;

## Improving our services

So that we can continually improve our websites and services, we may use your data to perform statistical analysis to help understand how people are using our services. On occasions we may ask you for feedback on your experience of using the websites. Unless otherwise stated, this information is only used internally and will not be published on the site.

## Informing you of special offers and services which may be of interest when you register with us

We would like to keep you updated, by e-mail or text, of other products and services which we feel you may benefit from or which you have specifically indicated that you have an interest in through our registration process.

We engage a third party email technology partner to help us coordinate and manage our email news letters. They may process and store your personal information on our behalf in their systems subject to strict compliance with the Data Protection Act 1998. They will NOT contact you directly or share your personal information with any third parties.

We obtain additional personal information from third parties to enable us to improve the relevance of our communications to you.

You can easily unsubscribe from our emails at any time, either through your personal log in; by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of any electronic correspondence (may take up to 7 days to take effect); or by emailing us at [dpo@consumerchoices.co.uk](mailto:dpo@consumerchoices.co.uk "dpo@consumerchoices.co.uk").

## Broadband and home phone availability check

If you carry out an availability check on our websites, we will only use your postcode or phone number for the purpose of carrying out that check. The check is essential to find out which providers are available to you. This information is not stored once the check has been performed.

## Testimonials, Case Studies Prize Draws and Surveys

We may republish comments and testimonials sent to us by our users when they provide information by way of Case Study application forms and survey responses. These comments and testimonials may appear in articles and features on our website and other media. We will not disclose any user's email address or any level of personal information that would enable any third party to contact or identify a particular individual (for example a full name and full area of residency). If you do not want us to republish any comments or testimonials then this should be clearly indicated and we will fully comply with your request.

## Ask our Expert

We may republish extracts of emails sent to [ourexpert@broadbandchoices.co.uk](mailto:ourexpert@broadbandchoices.co.uk "ourexpert@broadbandchoices.co.uk"); [ourexpert@energychoices.co.uk](mailto:ourexpert@energychoices.co.uk "ourexpert@energychoices.co.uk"); [ourexpert@homephonechoices.co.uk](mailto:ourexpert@homephonechoices.co.uk "ourexpert@homephonechoices.co.uk"); or [ourexpert@digitalchoices.co.uk](mailto:ourexpert@digitalchoices.co.uk "ourexpert@digitalchoices.co.uk") in articles and features on our websites and in other media.

If you do not want us to republish any extracts from correspondence with Ask our Expert then this should be indicated in the body text of the email and we will fully comply with your request.

## Processing a transaction between you and a third party

If you place an order for a service with a third party (for example a home phone order) through our website then we will collect your personal information and provide this only to that third party to facilitate the transaction you have requested.

This data is collected and stored securely and is deleted from our records after the transaction has been processed by the third party provider.

## Security

All financial transactions are secured by SSL encryption to offer secure communications of sensitive data to and from the site.

However, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure and any information which you send to us is sent at your own risk.

## Third party providers’ and third party websites’ personal information policies

We will NOT share your personal data with any third parties so that they might try to communicate with you except for the express purpose of fulfilling our obligations as detailed above.

If you decide to enter into a contract with a third party provider via our website then you are strongly advised to read that chosen provider's privacy policy. We cannot be held responsible for the uses to which a third party puts your personal information once you have contracted with that party.

We link to third party websites from our own websites. We cannot be held responsible for the uses to which any third party puts your personal information once you have left our websites.
