# Privacy Policy | Brookfield Condominium Services

##  Privacy Policy for the Collection, Use, Disclosure and Security of Personal Information

Privacy of personal information about the unit owners, tenants and residents of the properties we manage is a fundamental cornerstone of our role as property managers and agents for condominium corporations, absentee owners of condominium units and landlords. We understand an individual’s right to privacy and we are committed to collecting, using, disclosing and securing your personal information responsibly and for no other purposes beyond the need to efficiently and effectively provide management services to you and to our clients.

Brookfield Condominium Services Ltd. has adopted the following privacy policy to meet this commitment.

##  Introduction

Brookfield Condominium Services Ltd. (hereinafter called “Brookfield”) is a company that provides property management services to condominium corporations, non-resident owners of condominium units and landlords of rental residential properties (hereinafter called “Clients”). In the course of servicing these Clients, Brookfield may collect certain personal information from condominium unit owners, tenants in condominium units and tenants or prospective tenants in rental residential properties (hereinafter called “Individuals”) necessary to carry on its activities as a managing agent for its Clients.

“Personal Information” means information that is personally identifiable to individuals. This may include, without limitation, the Individual’s name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, bank account number, payment histories and other information about his or her family in the case of a condominium unit owner and may further include, without limitation, age, income, employment status, credit history and debts and liabilities in the case of a tenant or a prospective tenant in condominium units or rental apartment buildings managed by Brookfield.

This Privacy Policy is based on, and complies with, Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), which includes the Ten Privacy Principles outlined in the National Standard of Canada entitled Model Code for the Protection of Personal Information and similar provincial legislation.

This Privacy Policy sets out the ten principles that Brookfield follows to ensure that we protect our Individuals’ and employees’ personal information when we collect, use or disclose it in the course of carrying on business activities in Canada. These correspond to similar principles contained in PIPEDA. All of our employees who have access to personal information must adhere to the Brookfield Privacy Policy and related procedures.

In some instances, where the purpose for collecting information is reasonably evident to the person providing the information, the purpose will be implied but not explicitly stated (for instance, on rental applications, when a potential tenant provides us with his or her income and banking information or on Pre-Authorized Payment applications when a unit owner authorizes the condominium corporation to withdraw monthly common charges from an Individual’s bank account).

Consent may be implicit when the purposes are not stated expressly but are implied by the circumstances of the transaction or follow logically from other expressly stated purposes). You can withdraw consent at any time, with certain exceptions (for example, subject to any legal or contractual restrictions) and upon reasonable notice to Brookfield. Brookfield will strive to inform an Individual of all implications of withdrawing his or her consent. You may contact Brookfield’s Privacy Officer respecting the withdrawal of any previously given consent or any change in the purposes for which information held by Brookfield may be used, disclosed or retained. Note that information may be retained by Brookfield for audit or archival purposes notwithstanding any withdrawal of consent otherwise applicable but the fact that consent has been withdrawn will be noted so as to prevent an unauthorized use.

Brookfield will only collect information that is reasonably necessary for the purposes identified. Information will be collected by fair and lawful means. 

##  Principle 5 - Limiting Use, Disclosure and Retention

##  Principle 6 - Accuracy 

Brookfield will keep personal information as accurate, complete and current as necessary to fulfill the identified purposes for which it was collected. Brookfield will update or correct any personal information held by it if the individual concerned provides Brookfield with particulars, satisfactory to it, of any required updating or correction. 

##  Principle 7 - Safeguarding Personal Information 

Personal information is safeguarded to protect against loss, theft or unauthorized access, disclosure, use or modification of information using measures appropriate to the sensitivity, amount, format, nature and storage of the information and will involve, as applicable, physical, organizational and electronic security measures.
