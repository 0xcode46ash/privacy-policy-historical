# Brooks Brothers | Privacy Policy

## Security & Privacy

## Security

Brooks Brothers protects your online order and registration information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology. SSL encrypts your order information to avoid the decoding of that information by anyone other than Brooks Brothers. The secure mode begins when you initiate your order. If you see an unbroken key or a closed lock (depending upon your browser), then SSL is active. You can double-check by looking at the URL line of your browser when accessing a secure service. The first characters of the site address will change from "http" to "https". Some versions of the browsers and some firewalls don't permit communication through secure servers. In that case, you'll be unable to connect to the server so you won't have to worry about mistakenly placing an order through an unsecured connection. However, please feel free to place your order with us by phone at 1.800.274.1815 (1.860.741.4800 outside the United States). Our customer service representatives will be happy to assist you. 

## Privacy

We respect your privacy and, therefore, Brooks Brothers does not sell or rent the personal information you provide to us to any third party you do not wish us to do so. Upon your request, we will not share your personal information with any unaffiliated third party. We may make our mailing list available to carefully screened companies whose products and services might interest you. If you do not wish to receive such mailings, or for us to share your information with any third parties as described above, please contact us via email, phone, fax or mail (below). Include your name and address as it was supplied to us, and indicate "Do Not Share". 

Brooks Brothers may share information with its subsidiaries and other affiliated companies, and with other carefully selected vendors and business partners with whom we work. This includes companies that perform fraud prevention/detection services; assist us in providing our products and services to you; assist in maintaining and managing customer information to provide customer and internet services; take and fulfill orders; conduct Brooks Brothers promotions and surveys; or assist us in more effectively communicating with our customers. All companies that act on our behalf are contractually obligated to keep all information confidential and to use the customer information only to provide the services we ask them to perform for you and us. We may provide aggregate statistics about our customers, sales, traffic patterns and related site information to reputable third party vendors. We may disclose Personal Information we collect from you if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that disclosure is necessary (a) to obey the law or comply with legal process served on us or our affiliates; (b) to protect and defend our rights or property or the rights or property of other users of our Site; or (c) to act in an emergency to protect the personal safety of users of our Site or the public. If you register with us to receive promotional emails or postal mailings, you agree that Brooks Brothers may transfer your information to its international Brooks Brothers affiliates who may send you communications directly, depending on your location. 

Additionally we may disclose your personal information to the buyer as a result of the sale of stock or substantially all of the assets of Brooks Brothers, whether by merger, acquisition, or similar or related transactions or in the event of a liquidation of the assets of the company. 

We will add you to our mailing list when you supply us with your address. If you do not wish to receive our catalog, please contact us via email, phone, fax or mail (below). Include your name and address as it was supplied to us, and indicate "Do Not Mail". 

If you have chosen not to receive email or postal mailings from Brooks Brothers prior to your participation in a contest, sweepstakes, promotion or survey, you may still receive information from Brooks Brothers in connection with such activity if you register for or participate in it. You may also choose not to participate in contests, sweepstakes, promotions or surveys if you do not wish to receive information about Brooks Brothers or share your information with Brooks Brothers and the other companies sponsoring such activities at any time by contacting us by either email, phone or post mail. 

If you reach BrooksBrothers.com from a link on another website or search engine, information about your visit to BrooksBrothers.com may be collected by the provider of the referring website. You are encouraged to review the Privacy & Security Statement of these other websites (or search engines). You can avoid this by entering BrooksBrothers.com directly into the address field of your browser.

## Children's Privacy

Consistent with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, we will never knowingly request personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13 without prior verifiable parental consent.

Please note: we may nevertheless maintain a record of that person's name and address in a "do not register" file to avoid subsequent registration by a child under the age of 13.
