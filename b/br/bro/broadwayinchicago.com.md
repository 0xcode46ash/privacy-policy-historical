**Broadway In Chicago Privacy Notice  
**

  
Thank you for visiting broadwayinchicago.com. Your privacy is important to us. To better protect your privacy, we provide this notice explaining our information practices and the choices you can make about the way your information is collected and used at this website, or through ticket sales to Broadway In Chicago Shows, telephone or fax inquiries, or your membership in the Broadway In Chicago Club. 

  
**Information Collection  
**When you visit our website or purchase tickets to Broadway In Chicago Shows, inquire about information by telephone or fax or become a member of the Broadway In Chicago Club, we may request that you provide us with certain personally identifiable information, such as name, address, e-mail address, telephone and fax number and credit card information (for purchases). 

At Broadway In Chicago, you also can submit information about other people.  For example, if you order a gift online or by mail, fax or telephone and want it sent directly to the recipient, you will be asked to submit the recipient's name and address.  The types of personally identifiable information that may be collected about other people at these pages include: recipient's name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number. 

In addition, we may collect certain non-personally identifiable information when you visit many of our web pages such as the type of browser you are using (e.g., Netscape, Internet Explorer), the type of operating system you are using, (e.g., Windows 2000 or Mac OS) and the domain name of your Internet service provider (e.g., America Online, Earthlink). 

  
**Use of Information  
**We use the information you provide about yourself and others to fulfill requests for, and to offer, our products, programs, and services (e.g., Broadway in Chicago Club membership, our e-Bulletin sign-up, or information on special events), to send them your gifts or other products, and to respond to inquiries about our offerings (e.g., questions about tickets and shows).  We also use this information to communicate with you and others, such as to notify winners of our contests or drawings, or to contact you about your account with us.  We may also share this information with our partners, sponsors and affiliates, including Clear Channel Communications, Inc., Nederlander Producing Organization, and other related theatre organizations. 

We may also use the information we collect to enable you and others to receive information from us and unrelated third parties about other products, programs, or services that we believe may be of interest. 

We may, on occasion, supplement information we receive online with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our website and online products, programs, and services, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our website, products, programs and services. 

We may use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience.  We also may use this information in the aggregate to analyze site usage, as well as to offer you products, programs, or services.

  
**Disclosures to Third Parties  
**Agents and contractors to whom we provide access to personally identifiable information are required to protect this information in a manner that is consistent with this privacy notice by, for example, not using the information for any purpose other than to carry out the services they are performing for us. 

We may disclose specific contact information when we determine that such disclosure is necessary to comply with law, to cooperate with law enforcement or to protect the interests or safety of Broadway In Chicago or its affiliates or other visitors to our website or users of sources of entertainment provided by Broadway In Chicago.  Also, your contact information may be passed on to a third party in the event of a transfer of ownership or assets, merger, or a bankruptcy, of Broadway In Chicago.

  
**Collection of Information by Third Parties and Sponsors  
**Our site contains links to other sites (e.g., ticket vendor sites) whose information practices may be different than ours.  Visitors should consult the other sites’ privacy notices, as we have no control over information that is submitted to, or collected by, these third parties. 

We sometimes may provide content that is sponsored by or co-branded with identified third parties.  By virtue of these relationships, the third parties may obtain personally identifiable information that visitors submit to us or directly to such third parties to participate in the website activity.  We have no control over these third parties’ use of this information.  Such third parties may include, for example, automobile manufacturers, banks, theatrical producers, or other parties whose names appear in connection with the theatres.  If you want to lean more about a third party’s privacy policy, or you do not want to receive communications from a particular third party, or you have other questions, instructions or concerns to which you would like a third party to respond, then you must contact that third party directly.

State Street, Suite 810, Chicago, Illinois 60602. 

We may share personally identifiable information with companies whose practices are not covered by this privacy notice (e.g., other marketers, retailers, and non-profit organizations, such as, for example, automobile manufacturers, banks and theatrical producers) that want to market products or services to you.  If you would like to request that we not share your information for these purposes, or to opt-out of third-party sharing, please e mail [privacynotice@broadwayinchicago.com](mailto:privacynotice@broadwayinchicago.com) or write to us at 17 N.
