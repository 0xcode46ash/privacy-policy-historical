  5. #### Use of Cookies

A cookie is a small data file that certain Web sites write to your hard drive when you visit them. A cookie file can contain information such as a user ID that the site uses to track the pages you've visited, but the only personal information a cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. A cookie can't read data off your hard disk or read cookie files created by other sites. Some parts of this web site use cookies to track user traffic patterns. We do this in order to determine the usefulness of the information to our users and to see how effective our navigational structure is in helping users reach that information. Brookfield does not correlate this information with data about individual users, nor does it share this information or sell it to any third party. If you prefer not to receive cookies on this web site, you can set your browser to warn you before accepting cookies and refuse the cookie when your browser alerts you to its presence. You can also refuse all cookies by turning them off in your browser. You do not need to have cookies turned on to use any area of this web site.
