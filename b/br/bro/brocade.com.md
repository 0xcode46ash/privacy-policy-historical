**How Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?**

We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track user preferences and to maximize the performance of our Site and Services.  We, or third parties on our behalf, may combine this information with other personal information we collect from you.

Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.

**_Cookies._** Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browsers for record-keeping purposes.  Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and Services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.

**_Session Cookies._** Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you logged into the Site.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.

**_Persistent Cookies._**   Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.

**_Disabling Cookies._**   Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browser certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.

**_Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies._**   Clear GIFS are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.  We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in e-mails to our customers, to help us measure e-mail response rates, identify when our e-mails are viewed, and determine whether our e-mails are forwarded.

**_Third Party Analytics._   **We use third party automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to help us improve our Services, performance, and user experiences.  These applications may use cookies and other tracking technologies to perform their services.  We do not share your personal information except on an aggregated basis with these third parties.

**How Do We Use Third-Party Ad Networks?**

We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.  This enables us and these third parties to deliver ads for products and services in which you might be interested.  Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.  We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy.

You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).

Opting out of one or more NAI member or DAA member networks (many of which will be the same) means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.  You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you change web browsers, your NAI or DAA opt-out may no longer be effective.  For more information regarding this practice by NAI members and DAA members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by NAI and DAA members, please visit their respective websites: <http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/> (NAI) and <http://www.aboutads.info/choices/> (DAA).
