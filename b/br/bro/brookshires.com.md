|   
  
---|---  
  
Please note that the practices of Brookshire Grocery Company (“Brookshire”), its affiliates, and agents, with respect to data collected and used by Brookshire in connection with this website and all other websites of Brookshire and its affiliates with links to this policy (collectively, the “Site”) and Brookshire products and services available or enabled via the Site (“Products and Services”), are governed by this online privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) as amended from time to time, and not the privacy policy in effect at the time the data was collected. Please review our Privacy Policy regularly to see the current Privacy Policy. 

**You are agreeing to accept the practices set out in this Privacy Policy by using the Site. If you have objections to the Privacy Policy, you should immediately discontinue use of the Site and the Products and Services enabled by the Site.**

_**What This Privacy Policy Covers**_

This Privacy Policy describes how Brookshire treats personal information that Brookshire collects and receives, including information related to your past use of Brookshire products and services. Personal information is information about you that is personally identifiable like your name, address, email address, telephone number, credit card and checking account information, and any information that can be linked to you that is not otherwise publicly available. 

This policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Brookshire does not own or control or to people that Brookshire does not employ or manage. In addition, certain Brookshire associated companies such as MyWebGrocer.com have their own Privacy Policies which can be viewed by clicking on the links. Brookshire is not responsible for the content or the privacy and security policies or practices of any such companies or people.

_**Information Sharing and Disclosure**_

Brookshire Grocery Company does not rent, sell, or share personal information about you with other people or nonaffiliated companies except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or when required to do so by law or legal process.

_**Orders**_

If you purchase a product or service from us, we request certain personally identifiable information from you on our order form. You must provide contact information (such as name, email, and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number, expiration date). 

We use this information for billing purposes and to fill your orders. If we have trouble processing an order, we will use this information to contact you. 

_**Application Forms**_

If you submit information to us on our site, we may require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, and email address. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you.

_**Surveys or Contests**_

From time-to-time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our site. If you participate, we will request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code). We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, to monitor site traffic and personalize the site. 

_**Special Offers and Updates**_

We will send you information on products, services, special deals and promotions. You can sign up for these emails from us on our registration and/or preferences page. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the "Choice / Opt-out" section below.

_**Newsletters**_

If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we always provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the "Choice / Opt-out" section below.

_**Customer Service**_

Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, as needed. 

_**Profile**_

We store information that we collect through cookies, log files, clear gifs, and other tools to create a “profile” of your preferences. We may tie your personally identifiable information, and your purchasing history, to information in the profile, in order to provide tailored promotions and marketing offers and to improve the content of the site for you. 

_**Aggregate Information (non-personally identifiable)**_

We collect, store and use aggregate data that does not contain personally identifiable information, including demographic or statistical information. We may share aggregated demographic information about our user base with our partners and advertisers to help us serve and understand our customers better. This information does not identify individual users. For example we may inform a manufacturer of the number of products that were purchased in aggregate. 

_**Legal Disclaimer**_

We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe it is necessary to share information in order to protect the security of the Site, to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of Brookshire Grocery Company terms of use, or as otherwise required by law (including a subpoena, interrogatory, or discovery request).

_**Choice/Opt-out**_

We provide you the opportunity to ‘opt-out’ of having your personally identifiable information used for certain purposes, when we ask for this information. For example, if you purchase a product/service but do not wish to receive any additional marketing material from us, you can indicate your preference on our order page. 

If you no longer wish to receive our newsletter and promotional communications, you may opt-out of receiving them by following the instructions included in each newsletter or communication.

_**Log Files**_

As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click stream data. 

We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users’ movements around the site, optimize the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. 

We use a third-party tracking service (e.g.SurfStats, Web Trends, etc) that may use cookies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate that we used to improve the experience of the site. 

_**Cookies**_

A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site, if the user allows. 

We use both session ID cookies and/or persistent cookies. We use session cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you close you browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser's “help” file. Persistent cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site. 

If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, will be limited. 

_**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons/Web Bugs)**_

We use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails recipients have opened. This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns. If you would like to opt-out of these emails, please see "Choice / Opt-out

_**Links to Other Sites**_

This website contains links to other sites that are not owned or controlled by Brookshire. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy or security policies or practices of such other sites. Any personal information that you provide when accessing a third-party website is subject to the third-party’s security and privacy policies. Brookshire is not responsible for any information that you provide to a third party.

We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policy of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.

This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected by this website. 

_**Security**_

The security of your personal information is very important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our order forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). Once we received the data it is immediately re-encrypted prior to storage. By default, payment card data is permanently destroyed within 91 days of submission. 

We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, while we strive to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security

_**Children**_

Parent should always supervise their children while online. Brookshire’s website is not designed nor intended to collect personal information from children under the age of thirteen.
