## Your privacy is important

This policy applies to John Fairfax Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries ("Fairfax") except for f2 Limited and its subsidiaries ("f2") (together "Fairfax Group"). The f2 Network Privacy Policy applies to f2 and can be accessed by visiting www.f2.com.au. This statement sets out Fairfax's policy on managing the personal information that it collects.

Fairfax is bound by the National Privacy Principles contained in the Commonwealth Privacy Act, except for its activities carried on in the course of journalism. Fairfax is exempt from complying with the Privacy Act in relation to journalism activities. Fairfax has, however, publicly committed to complying with the Australian Press Council Privacy Standards for the use of personal information in the course of journalism.

Fairfax may, from time to time, review and update this privacy policy statement to take account of new laws and technology and changes to Fairfax's operations. All personal information held by Fairfax will be governed by Fairfax's most recent policy.

## What kind of personal information does Fairfax collect and how does Fairfax collect it?

Fairfax collects personal information from a variety of sources, including from members of the public, advertisers, prospective employees, newsagents, mailing lists, recruitment agencies, contractors and business partners.

In general, the personal information Fairfax collects includes (but is not limited to) name, address, contact details, gender, occupation, in some cases membership of professional associations and, where relevant, financial information, including credit card information, banking details and income information.

Where Fairfax enters into a transaction with an individual, Fairfax may collect other types of personal information, depending on the nature of the transaction. Fairfax will generally state the specific purposes for which this personal information will be used and to whom it may be disclosed, other than as set out in this policy.

Personal information you provide: You may provide information when you acquire a product or service from Fairfax, provide a product or service to Fairfax, complete a questionnaire, enter a competition, enter an event, seek employment, or when you communicate with Fairfax by e-mail, telephone or in writing (for example if you contact customer service or provide feedback).

Indirect collection: Although Fairfax generally collects personal information about individuals directly from those individuals, in some circumstances Fairfax may obtain personal information from a third party, for example from a commercially available mailing list.
