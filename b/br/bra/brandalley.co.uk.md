Cookies are very tiny text files which are stored on your computer when you visit certain web pages in order to record your preferences. The cookies on Brandalley.co.uk automatically delete information once the web page is closed. 

Web code(html)

Certain web pages of the site can sometimes contain electronic images or "web code", which makes it possible to keep track of the total number of visitors that visit the webpage. The web codes may be used by some of our partners to measure and improve the effectiveness of some advertising. In all circumstances, the information obtained via these web codes is strictly anonymous and simply makes it possible to gather statistics on the frequencies of visitors on the web site. This enables us to provide better service to our site users. 

Financial security

Brandalley does not store any financial information concerning your credit card details. All this information is securely preserved by CIC bank. With an immediate payment by bank card, (the only means of payment available through the Brandalley website), the user will carry out his/her payment via the Brandalley site using the TPE system (Terminal Electronic Payment) of CIC bank.

The Brandalley site is secured by encoding S.S.L. (Secure Socket Layer) signed by VERISIGN in order to most effectively protect all possible data relating to the means of payment.  
Thus, the banking data of the user are re-transmitted at the bank which makes it secured by encoding S.S.L.  
Consequently, the banking data of the user will not be transmitted on the information processing system of Brandalley.

The responsibility for Brandalley is consequently released for this reason.
