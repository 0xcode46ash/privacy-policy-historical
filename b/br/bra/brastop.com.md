## Privacy Policy

Brastop.com is committed to respecting your privacy and security of information passed to us.

Brastop.com collects personal information from our online visitors on a voluntary basis when signing up to the newsletter (for example name, address, phone number, email address, lingerie sizes). If you choose to no longer receive emails from us, please uncheck the box in your account details page or re-enter your email address in to the form field on the right and your will then be prompted to remove your details from our mailing list.

When making a purchase online, the information required, (for example, credit or debit card number, expiration date, name, mailing address, telephone number and email address) is to allow us to process your order.

We use the information for purely legitimate business, and will never pass on your details to an outside party without asking your first.

We maintain appropriate safeguards to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information you have provided us with.

We reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Please check back from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes in our privacy practices.

By supplying us with your details, you signify your consent to Brastop.com's Privacy Policy.

## Security

Please don't worry about sending your credit or debit card details via our website. All transactions are totally secure because all the details that you send to us are encrypted and sent across a secure connection. There will be a security icon in the bottom right hand corner of your browser to signify you are in secure mode - this is usually depicted as either a padlock or key symbol. Another check is that during payment, the address at the top of the browser will begin https:// rather than http://.

The encryption technique we use is standard for e-commerce and is certified by SecureTrading, the world's most respected certification body for Internet firms. This means that the information you send us cannot be read by anyone other than the Bravissimo team. 

If you are still not convinced about the safety of shopping online, but would like to order from Brastop.com, please [send us an email](https://web.archive.org/web/20090216192953id_/http%3A//www.brastop.com/brastop_contacts.aspx) or call our customer services consultants on 020 8861 1945. We are open from 8.00am to 17.30pm on Monday to Friday, and from 10am to 5pm on Saturday and Sunday.
