  |  About Us |    
  | 

Brandchannel.com launched on February 5, 2001, by Interbrand, as the world’s only online exchange about branding. It has grown to become a valuable resource to a growing database of subscribers and countless other readers. 

Brandchannel.com is committed to providing a global perspective on brands. Challenging viewers to think further about the important issues that are affecting brands now and in the future. To further enhance brand awareness, we offer tools and information including global listings for conferences, courses and careers, as well as links to other valuable industry resources. Brandchannel is not a one-way street; we provide the opportunity for an open exchange on the subject of brands and branding from practitioners around the world through features like online debates, and white paper submissions. Brandchannel.com is unique from other branding-related websites in that it is global in scope, offers original branding content, has an independent, unique voice, is easy to navigate, has no membership fees, and appeals to a wide range of skill levels. 

Brandchannel.com. The world's only online exchange about branding.

  |  Brandchannel Privacy Policy |    
  |  Brandchannel.com respects your right to the privacy of the personal information you provide us on our website. To that end, unless you designate otherwise or we state otherwise in this policy or at the time information is collected, any personal information you provide to brandchannel.com will be known only to two parties: you and brandchannel.com. The following policy is intended to explain how your personal information will be treated as you make use of our site and its features. Personal information includes your name and e-mail addresses, click-through activity and any other personal information you may provide here. This policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically.  |

  |  Traffic data

Each time a visitor comes to the brandchannel.com website, our server -- like most on the web -- collects some basic technical information, including, for example, your domain name (e.g., whether the user has logged on from aol.com or whitehouse.gov), referral data (e.g., we record the address of the last URL a user visited prior to clicking through to brandchannel.com) and browser and platform type (e.g., a Netscape browser on a Macintosh platform). 

We also count, track and aggregate the visitor's activity into our analysis of general traffic flows at our site (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the site, etc.). To these ends, we may merge information about visitors and visits into group data; but we will not disclose your individual identity or personally identifiable data without your permission. When we do present aggregated information to outside companies we do so only in the format of anonymous statistics, meaning that no one will ever be able to identify you or contact you.
