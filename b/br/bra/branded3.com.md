### Cookie policy

### Introduction

When we provide services, we want to make them easy, useful and reliable. Where services are delivered on the internet, this sometimes involves placing small amounts of information on your device, for example, a computer or mobile phone, if you agree. These small files of information are known as cookies. Cookies allow us to distinguish you from other users of our website(s), which helps us to provide you with a better experience when browsing our website(s) and also allows us to improve our website(s). Cookies cannot be used to identify you personally.

Examples of how cookies are used to improve services for you are:

Enabling a service to recognise your device so you don’t have to give the same information several times during one task.

Recognising that you may already have given a username and password so you don’t need to do it for every web page requested.

Measuring how many people are using services, so they can be made easier to use and there’s enough capacity to ensure they are fast.  
Our cookies aren’t used to identify you personally. They’re just here to make the website(s) work better for you. In fact, you can manage and/or delete these small files as you wish.

### Cookies for improving service

We use several different types of cookie on our website(s); these are:

 **Session cookies:** These are temporary cookies, which are stored on your device for as long as you’re browsing our website(s), and remember such things as adding a product to a shopping basket.

 **Persistent cookies** : This type of cookie stays on your device even once you’ve closed your browser, and typically remains for around 30 days. They help websites to personalise your experience by remembering certain products you’ve viewed or bought before.

 **Third-party cookies:** This type of cookie will collect information which is sent back to a website other than the one you’re currently browsing, and is used to improve user experience on our website(s).

The data collected is completely anonymous and can be used, for example, by advertisers to find out where and when users are clicking on their ads.
