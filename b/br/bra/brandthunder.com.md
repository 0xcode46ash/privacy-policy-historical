# Privacy Policy | Brand Thunder

**Theme Privacy Policy**

**Brand Thunder, LLC (“Brand Thunder”)** provides this Privacy Policy to inform users who download a Browser Theme from our websites, www.brandthunder.com, www.thunderthemes.com, and www.bt-engage.com (the “Sites”), about the limited use and disclosure of information generated by the Theme. The Theme may include links or otherwise allow you to access and perhaps submit information to third-party applications or sites. This Privacy Policy applies to the Theme only. Any information you submit to linked sites or other applications that may be accessible from the Theme will be subject to the privacy policies of those sites or applications, if any.

You are not required to register with us to download a Theme, and may do so anonymously. (If you have registered with any of our Sites or have contacted us seeking help, the use and disclosure the information you provided during that process is governed by our general Privacy Policy).

**No Spyware, No Adware**

The Theme does not collect any personal information about you (such as your name, email address, etc.). Further, it does not: (a) collect or report back to us (or anyone else) any information about your activities on sites you visit on the Internet; (b) monitor or collect any search queries or information that you provide in the Theme or to any other website; (c) serve pop-ups when you are browsing the Internet or any other time; or (d) collect or report back to us (or anyone else) any data regarding your computer keystrokes or other data unrelated to the services the Theme provides.

**Anonymous Theme Usage Statistics.** In order to continue to provide the high-quality Themes to you and to other Users, we do need certain statistics about how our Themes are used. To facilitate this, the Theme includes one or more unique application numbers that are not associated with you or your Brand Thunder account (if you have chosen to register with us). These numbers are sent to us when you install or uninstall the Theme and when the Theme periodically contacts our servers, for example, to request automatic updates or to provide us with usage statistics about that Theme, such as whether it is active, default settings and total usage of other features of the Theme, including links to third-party applications or sites (“Usage Statistics”). All Usage Statistics are recorded on a non-personally identifiable basis and is kept strictly anonymous. 

We may use Usage Statistics to improve the Themes and other products and services we offer, to detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity, and may disclose anonymous Usage Statistics to third-parties with whom we do businesses. 

Children. We do not use the Service to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with personally identifiable information without their consent, he or she should contact us at info@brandthunder.com. We will delete such information from our files.
