Survey information will be used for purposes of monitoring or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.

  


### Polls

This website has a section where users can take silly little polls. The aggregate results are displayed for everyone to see. We store your answer so we can show you what your answer was (in case you forgot). Individial user's answers are never shared with anyone else. Occasionally, we may use the answer to one of the polls to customize a portion of the website for you. Participation in these polls is completely voluntary.
