This Privacy Policy was last updated on May 6, 2014.

#### Our Policy:

Welcome to the web site (the “Site”) of Brackify, LLC, doing business as Brackify (“Brackify”, “we”, “us” and/or “our”). This Site is operated by Brackify and has been created to provide information about Brackify and to provide end users (“you”, “your”) with the ability to participate in one or more voting based brackets and/or other social games (the “Brackify Services”). Many of our voting brackets and other social games are hosted in connection with a third party (our “Partners”). This Privacy Policy sets forth Brackify’s policy with respect to information including personally identifiable data (“Personal Data”) and other information that is collected from Site visitors. 

#### Information We Collect:

**Personal Data That You Provide Through the Site:** We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily provide such information, such as when you contact us with inquiries, respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the Brackify Services or use certain Brackify Services. For instance, when users register with the Site, they are asked to provide their name and e-mail address. Additional information may be provided to Brackify when users voluntarily connect to the Site through a social media account. Wherever Brackify collects Personal Data, we make an effort to provide a link to this Privacy Policy.   
By voluntarily providing us with Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

This Site may use such information and pool it with other information to track, for example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note that no Personal Data is available or used in this process. 

In operating this Site, we may use a technology called "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer that hosts our Site gives to your browser when you access the Site.
