1\. Information We Collect About You

The information we collect from you depends on what activities you are carrying out on our website, whether you are logged in or not and whether you are making a purchase. We may collect:

•     contact information, such as name, address and telephone number,

•     online contact information, such as your email address,

•     purchase information, such as credit card details,

•     other personal information such as your size if you are buying something from us,

•     navigation and click-stream data, the time of accessing the website, duration of your visit, products you viewed or searched for, items in your basket, at which stage you abandoned your basket,

•     information from cookies or web beacons.

2\. How We Collect Your Personal Information

BraOnSale obtains information from you in three ways:

•     either by you typing your personal details in,

•     by the automatic collection of information about you as you use the website,

•     or from third parties.

A) Keying in your details

If you wish to place an order we will ask you to key in your contact and financial information as you proceed through the stages of making a purchase, in order to process and deliver your order. Similarly, if you request a catalog, we will ask you to enter your name and delivery details or if you wish to receive email alerts, we will ask you to provide your email address.

B) Automatic collection

Like most websites, our website uses cookies and web beacons to enhance your shopping experience.  A cookie is a piece of data that our website automatically transfers to the hard drive of your PC or mobile device when your browser accesses our website.

You can find out more about this type of technology through your internet browser.  For example:

•     If you use Internet Explorer click ‘Help’ on the toolbar then search on ‘Cookies’ in the box which appears

•     If you use Safari click ‘Safari’ then ‘Preferences’ then ‘Security’. You can then click ‘Help’ to learn more about cookies and the options your browser gives you.

•     If you use Mozilla Firefox you can find out more here.

You may refuse to accept cookies by changing the settings on your browser. However if you change the settings to refuse cookies you may be unable to access certain parts of the site. Unless you have adjusted your browser settings so that the browser refuses cookies, our system will issue cookies when you log on to our site.

The system may also use web beacons which are similar but not identical to cookies in the way they operate. You can find out more about web beacons on Wikipedia here.

If you are only browsing our website and have not logged in, we will not ask you to key in any personal information, but certain information - including computer and connection information, browser type and version, operating system and platform details, the time of accessing the website - is automatically collected about you. The same information will be collected every time you access our website for purposes of completion and support of the activity you are carrying out, anonymous user analysis and research and development.

Third Party Cookies and Web Beacons

We occasionally carry out market research and business development, which a third party assists with, during which they may send a cookie or web beacon. Some of our affiliate organizations may also do that so that they can track your purchasing and browsing behavior on our website.

C) Information from third parties

BraOnSale may also obtain information about you directly from third parties, such as new delivery address details from our carriers. We will use this information to update our delivery records and account information. We may also obtain details of your credit history from credit reference agencies, which we use to prevent and detect fraud.

3\. How We Identify You

As we explained above, every time your web browser accesses our website, we automatically receive and store certain information about you, by placing a cookie on your computer.

Two types of cookies are used on our website

1\. Session cookies (which remain in the cookie file of your browser only so long as you are accessing the website) are used:

•     to allow you to carry information from one page of our website to another without having to re-enter information,

•     to allow you to maintain a shopping basket during each visit that you make to the site, and

•     within registration or login mode, to allow you to access stored information.

2\. Persistent cookies (which remain in the cookie file of your browser for a longer period and store some basic information) help us to identify if you have visited our website previously using the same computer, and if so enable our website to remember the personal information you provided, keep track of the number of visits that you make to our website, where you browse and what you have purchased, and offer you tailored content, even though you may not have logged on.

Emails

Similarly, if you have ever provided us with an email address, we will be able to associate this email address back to your previous browsing and purchase experiences, whether you are logged on or not. We will know whether you have ever requested a catalogue or receive email alerts and will be able to associate this with any other contact information you may have given us.

Logged on

If you log in, then in addition to the information above, we will be able to associate your log in with your billing addresses, delivery addresses and your payment details.

4\. What We Use Your Information For

The principal purposes for which we collect and store your personal information are to process your orders and deliver products, authorize payment, bill you, respond to your enquiries, get in touch with you about other products and promotional offers, recommend products which we think might be of interest to you, and generally maintain the account you hold with us, together with improving our website.

Marketing and business development purposes

Apart from using your personal information to process any orders you may place, if you provide BraOnSale with an email address, it will automatically be entered into our regular email update service. From time to time, we may also contact you by post with information on special offers or events regarding our products or services or those of trusted third parties that we think you may be interested in. If you do not wish to receive updates or marketing information, please contact us.

If you do not object to receiving marketing material at the time the information was collected from you, but subsequently change your mind and no longer wish to receive this information, you can opt out.

Occasionally, BraOnSale may contact you by telephone for the purposes of market research, marketing our products (and for telemarketing) where you have consented to us doing so. You are under no obligation to participate in the call.

In addition, we may use an IP address to identify you and to gather broad demographic information about you, which we will use to assist in the detection of fraud, to help identify problems with our server and to administer our website.

Use of your information by third parties

BraOnSale will not sell your personal information to third parties. However, on occasions we do share customer information with third parties as described below.

BraOnSale is part of the J D Williams family of companies.  You can find out more about other J D Williams companies here. We may share your information with other group companies.

By providing a residential address or email address to us, you are consenting to BraOnSale disclosing these details to third party databases to which BraOnSale subscribes. If you have also given your details to at least one other entity which also subscribes to these databases, you may receive catalogues or other information about third party products or services.

BraOnSale often runs competitions on the website in conjunction with third parties, where we will ask you if you would like to be contacted by the third party sponsoring the prize about its products or services. If you expressly tell us that you want to receive this information, we will pass on your personal details.

BraOnSale collates statistics about site traffic, sales and other commercial information, which we pass on to third parties to assist us in improving the services we provide to you.  We also use demographic information to tailor the website to the interests of our customers, which we share with third parties, again on an aggregate basis only so that they can build up a better picture of our customer base and general consumer trends.

By making a purchase on the website, you consent to BraOnSale sharing your personal information with third parties as is necessary to process your order, for example, to banks, credit card companies and carriers.  Those third parties may be in countries outside of the United Kingdom.  For example if you are based in the UK and you ask us to deliver a gift in South Africa we may need to transfer your details to a courier in South Africa.  You consent to that transfer of data.  You also consent to us exchanging information with other companies in the interests of fraud detection and prevention and credit risk reduction or abuses of our website. In performing these checks, personal information provided by you may be disclosed to a credit reference agency, which may keep a record of that information. This is done only for identity verification purposes; no credit check is performed and it should not affect your credit rating. BraOnSale may also pass your personal information to our couriers or other agents if they need to contact you to process or arrange delivery of your order.

BraOnSale may disclose your personal information if necessary to comply with regulations or law or to assist with law enforcement, to enforce the terms under which you trade with BraOnSale, or to protect our property and other rights.

You may have accessed our website via a hyperlink from the website of one of our trading partners. If so, you consent to your personal details and purchase information, including behavioral patterns, being shared between BraOnSale and that trading partner in accordance with our contractual relationship with that trading partner.

In the unlikely event that BraOnSale is sold, or some of its assets transferred to a third party, your personal information, as a valuable asset of the company, may also be transferred. However, use of your personal information will remain subject to this Privacy Policy. Similarly, your personal information may be passed on to a successor in interest in the event of a liquidation or administration of BraOnSale. You hereby consent to those transfers occurring.

5\. Security

What Security Checks do we carry out?

As part of our policy to protect against the fraudulent use of credit cards, we carry out security checks on orders. These can take various forms, and may involve contacting you by telephone before your order is processed.

From time to time it may be necessary for us to ask you to provide a copy of a recent statement header for the card being used on your order. Please note that we are only interested in confirming information already provided on your order, i.e. the billing name and address and card issuer details, and do not need to see actual transactions, which can be covered up. If you have any concerns regarding security, please let us know.  We hope you appreciate that these measures are a necessary precaution, undertaken in the interests of fraud prevention.

Firewalls

Occasionally our site is blocked by a firewall. If you are using a personal firewall stopping and restarting the firewall may fix the problem.  If it is a corporate firewall you may wish to contact your organisation’s IT department.

Accounts and passwords

Your account contains your delivery and billing details, email preferences and a record of your orders. You will need your email address and password to see or edit your personal details.  Where you have chosen a password you are responsible for keeping this password confidential. Please do not to share your password with anyone.  Sending information via the internet is never completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data.  

If you are a new customer, you can create an account by going to the My Account page.

If you can't remember your password, go to the My Account page, enter your email address, click on 'Forgotten your password?' and it will be automatically emailed to you. For security reasons, our Customer Service team cannot see your password, so are unable to confirm it for you.

Once you have completed your purchase and to ensure all confidential information is removed, we recommend that you close all browsers.
