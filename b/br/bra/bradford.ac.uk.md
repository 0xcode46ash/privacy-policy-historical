## Marketing Communications Privacy Policy

The University of Bradford wishes to communicate with those people who have expressed an interest in studying at the University (enquirers) and current applicants in order to keep them informed of areas of information that may be of interest and help them to make a decision about whether to study at the University.

Areas of information we wish to inform you about include, but are not limited to, university rankings; testimonials from current students and alumni; accommodation; fees, finance and scholarships; on-campus events; key dates in the application process; information about the city of Bradford and the surrounding location as well as any other information the University feels may be of relevance to you.

The University will communicate via a variety of channels which will be determined by the contact details provided by you – these include, but are not limited to, email, telephone, SMS, Whatsapp, Skype, Social Media channels and Direct Mail.

From time to time the University may contact you requesting your participation in market research surveys in order to enhance and improve our application process, communication channels and academic programmes.

The University may analyse your personal information to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can ensure that the information we contact you with is relevant to you.

If you have provided your information in order to attend an event at the University we will use that information to provide you with details about that event. If you do not wish to receive any further information from us you will be able to opt out of those communications at the time of registering for the event.

**Under what legal basis does the processing of my personal data take place?**

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as enshrined into UK law by the Data Protection Act 2018 provides for a number of different legal bases under which processing of personal data may take place.  In this case, the following bases apply:

  * **_Consent (enquirers):_** when you provide us with your details we will ask for your consent to use those details to carry out the activities as detailed above. If you no longer wish to receive these communications you can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting the University at MarketingComms@bradford.ac.uk or updating your preferences in the Your Bradford portal.
  * **_Necessary in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (applicants)_** : as you have applied for an academic programme, the University will provide you with information to help you decide whether to accept an offer of a place, should the University choose to make you one.
  * **_Necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests (applicants):_** we process personal information for certain of our own legitimate business purposes. We will not process your data for the legitimate interests of any third parties. These interests include some or all of the following:  
\- where the processing enables us to enhance, modify, personalise or otherwise improve our services / communications for your benefit  
 \- to better understand how people interact with our websites   
\- to provide communications which we think will be of interest to you (direct marketing)  
\- to determine the effectiveness of promotional campaigns and advertising.   
These legitimate interests do not override your own interests as they are to provide you with the services and information you may need to make the right decision on where you choose to study. However if you would like us to stop using your information in this way please contact the University at [MarketingComms@bradford.ac.uk](mailto:MarketingComms@bradford.ac.uk) or update your contact preferences in the Your Bradford portal.  
Please bear in mind that if you make a request to us to stop using your information this may affect our ability to carry out tasks above for your benefit.



**What categories of personal data are used?**

All information necessary to provide you with relevant information with regards to your interest in the University of Bradford, this might normally include but is not limited to:

  * Name
  * Contact Details
  * Date of Birth
  * Postcode
  * Study Level (e.g. UG, PG, Foundation, Research, CPD or other)
  * Subject area of interest
  * Country of domicile, Nationality and/or UK residency status
  * Anticipated year of entry for study
  * Current educational status or qualifications.
  * Disability status
  * Original enquiry source (e.g. UCAS fair, school event or through our website)
  * Academic programme applied for
  * Current school or college (where relevant)
  * Application status (e.g. offer made, offer accepted or offer declined)
  * Details of any specific questions you ask of us



**Where do we get your personal data from?**

  * Personal data will be provided by you either:  
\- Directly in the course of making an enquiry for or at an event, through the University website or by making an application to study at the University.  
\- Indirectly in the course of making an enquiry through an agent, external information providers such as WhatUni or Hotcourses or any other providers where you submit your details to be provided with information from the University.  
\- Indirectly in the course of making an application through UCAS or an agent.



**Who else do we pass this information on to?**

Your personal data will only be shared with those third parties with whom the University works in order to provide you with relevant, personalised communications. These types of organisations can include but are not limited to:

  * Suppliers of digital content for emails
  * Service providers who send out emails, SMS, direct mail or other communications on behalf of the University
  * Providers who will use your profile information to identify others who may be interested in the University.



No information will be passed to third party organisations for them to contact you directly themselves.

**Do we transfer the information overseas?**

Data will be transferred **from** overseas only where contact information has been provided to University staff or agents in the course of making an enquiry about study at the University.

Data will only be transferred overseas to University staff based in the Dubai office to follow up on enquiries or applications from international students in that region. Information provided to the Dubai office will be subject to the same protection, processes and rights as data held in the UK.

Data stored in our database is transferred and saved on servers based in Canada. Transfers may be made where a third country, a territory or one or more specific sectors in the third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection.

Canada has “adequacy” status from the European Commission, which determined in 2001 that Canada’s law under PIPEDA (the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act) was strong enough to satisfy that any data transferred from the EU to Canada would be adequately protected.

**How long do we keep this information for?**

Personal data will be held up to a maximum of 4 years. This is because we understand that your original enquiry to study may be for a later academic year and you may then have further educational needs as you progress through your original course of choice. If, at any time, you would like to stop receiving these communications you can contact as at [MarketingComms@bradford.ac.uk](mailto:MarketingComms@bradford.ac.uk) or update your contact preferences in the Your Bradford portal.

**What are your rights as a data subject?**

As a person whose personal data we are processing, you have certain rights in respect of that personal data; you have the right:

  * To withdraw consent;
  * To access your personal data that we process;
  * To rectify inaccuracies in personal data that we hold about you if it is inaccurate or incomplete;
  * To request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there is no compelling reason for its continued processing;
  * To restrict the processing of your personal data in certain ways;
  * To obtain your personal data for reuse;
  * To object certain processing of your personal data;
  * To complain to the Information Commissioner’s Office about the way in which we process your personal data.
