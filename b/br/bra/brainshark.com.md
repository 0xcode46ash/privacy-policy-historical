Additionally, Brainshark’s services are used by customers to deliver video presentations that are embedded and linked within their own Websites and third party sites. Brainshark is not responsible for the information practices or content of its customers or third party sites. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage you to be aware when you leave our site and to read the privacy policies of each and every Website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy policy applies only to information collected by this Website.

**2\. Information Collected**

Brainshark, Inc. offers a variety of applications and services that are collectively referred to as the “Services.” Brainshark collects information from individuals who visit the Brainshark’s Websites (“Visitors”) and individuals who register to use the Services (“Customers”). Customers include both paying subscribers as well as subscribers of its free services. Customers should also refer to Brainshark’s [Terms of Use](https://web.archive.org/company/terms-conditions) for the appropriate offering.

The types of information Brainshark collects (“Personal Information”) may include:

  * Information you provide to Brainshark - When expressing an interest in obtaining additional information about the Services or registering to use the Services, Brainshark may require you to provide personal contact information, such as your name, your company name, your job title or role, your address, your phone number, and your email address.
  * Website navigational information - Brainshark uses commonly used information-gathering tools, such as cookies and Web beacons, to collect information as you navigate Brainshark’s Websites (“Website Navigational Information”). This Website Information includes standard information from your Web browser (such as browser type, version, and language), your Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the actions you take on Brainshark’s Websites (such as, pages viewed, links clicked).
  * Information you publish to Brainshark blogs or public portals – Brainshark’s Websites include public blogs, portals, and elements of the Brainshark’s free Website, myBrainshark™, that allow Visitors to submit and publish comments.

Brainshark uses data about Visitors and Customers to perform the following actions:

  * To respond to your request - such as to create a Brainshark account, provide login information for a webinar for which you have registered or provide technical support.
  * For marketing purposes - Brainshark may use information you provide to contact you to further discuss your interest in the Services and to send you information regarding Brainshark or its Services.

  * To process your payment - Brainshark uses credit card information solely to process payment for Services for which the Customer has provided that information.

Tracking information includes the date and time that a presentation was viewed, IP address and location, what portion(s) of the content were viewed and in what order, and responses to interactive questions or surveys. Individual information may be associated with this tracking information, either through information you provide to the Customer or by a unique identifier that the Customer has associated with an individual and has passed to a personalized presentation URL. Reporting and Notification features enable Customers to receive tracking information via emailed reports or to pass data to their other systems. Brainshark does not use or access individual information collected by its Customers in their use of the Services except with permission in providing Support and assistance. Brainshark does not sell this information.

**Public Blogs, Portals, and Customer Articles**

We do not have access or control of the information posted to the blog managed by that third-party application. You will need to contact or login into the third-party application if you want the personal information that was posted to the comments section removed.

**Transfer of Information**

Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, or other governmental jurisdiction where the privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction.

Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement to that transfer.

**Cookies**

Brainshark uses cookies on this site to track and target the interests of our users and to enhance the experience on our site. A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. These cookies cannot access, read or modify any other data on a computer. All web-browsers offer the option to refuse any cookie. If a visitor refuses the cookie, Brainshark does not gather any information on that visitor. You may also delete a cookie manually from your hard drive. Cookies themselves do not contain any personal information. We do link the information we store in cookies to personal information you may submit while on our site (such as email address and password) so that you do not need to enter it each time you login. (Please refer to Section #2 and #3 of this policy for what type of information we collect and for what purpose.) We do not sell or share this interests information.

The use of cookies placed by third parties is not covered by our privacy policy. We do not have access or control over these cookies.

**Analytics/ Log Files**

As is true of most web sites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We do link this automatically collected data to other information we collect about you.

**Clear Gifs (Web Beacons)**

Our third party tracking utility partner employs a software technology called ‘clear gifs’ (sometimes referred to as Web Beacons), that help Brainshark better manage content on our site by informing Brainshark what informational content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. When a visitor access pages on our web site with a clear gif, notice of that visit is generated which may be processed by us. We do link the information gathered by clear gifs to a Visitor’s personal information.. If you turn off cookies, web beacon technologies will still detect anonymous visits, but the notices they generate cannot be associated with personal information and are disregarded.

**Local Storage/ HTML5**

We use Local Storage Objects (LSOs) such as HTML5 or Flash to store content information. Various browsers may offer their own management tools for removing HTML5 LSOs. To manage Flash LSOs please [click here](http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html)

**Other Tracking Technologies**

Technologies such as: tags and scripts are used by Brainshark and our partners [e.g. marketing partners], affiliates, or analytics or service providers [e.g. online customer support provider].These technologies are used in analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users’ movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We may receive reports based on the use of these technologies by these companies on an individual as well as aggregated basis.

**Behavioral Targeting**

We partner with a third party to either display advertising on our Web site or to manage our advertising on other sites. Our third party partner may use technologies such as cookies to gather information about your activities on this site and other sites in order to provide you advertising based upon your browsing activities and interests. If you wish to not have this information used for the purpose of serving you interest-based ads, you may opt-out by clicking [here](http://preferences-mgr.truste.com/) (or if located in the European Union click [here](http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/)). Please note this does not opt you out of being served ads. You will continue to receive generic ads.

Safe Harbor Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of personal data from the European Union member countries.
