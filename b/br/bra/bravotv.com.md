You must be eighteen years of age (18) or older to be a member of our general audience website and receive membership benefits, such as our newsletter and to participate in our Interactive Areas. We will not accept membership registrations from visitors under the age of eighteen. Please see our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20030402130601id_/http%3A//bravotv.com/information/terms.php).

III. Collection of Personal Information

We provide various informative, educational, and entertaining features as part of this website. To provide and maintain these features, we collect certain non-personal and personal information for specific purposes. For website activities that request personal information, you agree to provide accurate and current information about yourself. Your membership and/or participation in our website activities will be canceled without notice if at any time we discover that you provide false information, or violate any term of our Privacy Policies or our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20030402130601id_/http%3A//bravotv.com/information/terms.php). We retain personal information for an indefinite amount of time to preserve our membership database and to comply with various federal and state laws. For example, we are required by various state laws to keep certain information on contest or sweepstakes entries for an extended period of time following the event.

IV. Registration for Participation in General Audience Website Activities and Services

Use and Collection of Information by Bravo

To participate as a member of our general audience website, or in special events, contests, sweepstakes or Interactive Areas, you may be required to provide personal information such as your name, home and e-mail addresses, telephone number, birth date and gender. Non-members may also participate in Interactive Areas conducted, operated and/or managed by Bravo after submitting their full name, e-mail address, and selecting a username and password. Interactive Areas not conducted, operated and/or managed by Bravo may require a different registration process. We may also survey visitors about various topics, including their television viewing preferences and comments about how we can improve our programming, website, and services to you. Response to our surveys is entirely voluntary.

We collect personal information for several important purposes, including to protect the security of our visitors and the site, improve our program service and website, distribute our newsletter, notify the winners of our contests and sweepstakes, allow participation in Interactive Areas, and for future marketing and/or promotional use about our program service or website. We will also offer an "E-card" feature that allows visitors to send an e-mail version of a post card to another person to inform them about Bravo activities. We do not collect the sender's or the recipient's e-mail information on E-Cards.

The only personal information this website obtains about you is information voluntarily provided by you. We do not collect additional personal information about visitors or members from other sources. This means that a person can visit our website and navigate through the site without giving us personal information. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we collect non-personal information about our members and visitors, such as Internet server and browser identification, the Internet service provider, the web page from which a visitor enters our site, and how much time the visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's personal identity.

Our contests, sweepstakes, and special events are often produced with the generous support of non-affiliated sponsors and/or promotional partners. The personal information collected by our website in conjunction with such events may also be used for the marketing of additional services and events by Bravo , and/or its promotional partners and sponsors beyond the contest, sweepstakes and/or special event. Depending on the event, visitors will be able to either grant their approval on how their personal information will be used before it is collected ("opt-in") or choose to deny use of their information for additional purposes ("opt-out"). Prior to the commencement of each contest, sweepstakes, and/or special event, we will prominently post on the website applicable rules, terms and conditions, and if necessary, any supplemental privacy provisions that will inform our visitors about how their personal information will be collected, used and disclosed.

Use and Collection of Information by Contract Service and Operational Providers

For the convenience of our visitors, we will provide the opportunity to purchase Bravo-related merchandise and services through this website. Companies not affiliated, owned or operated by Bravo, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries may handle some of these transactions. We call these companies that conduct our e-commerce operations and/or order fulfillment "operational providers." We generally require our operational providers to adhere to the provisions in Bravo's privacy policy. We generally prohibit such providers from sharing our visitors' personal information with parties other than Bravo and require that these providers only use the personal information for the purpose of conducting the sale of Bravo-related merchandise.

Occasionally, an operational provider will have its own terms of use and a different privacy policy. In these instances, we will identify such providers in this Privacy Policy. Be advised that when you visit the operational provider's website, you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that provider.

Use and Collection of Information by Advertisers and Sponsors

Our website will post banner ads and other forms of advertisements, and/or links to the websites of advertisers or sponsors, which are companies that are not owned or operated by Bravo, its parents, affiliates or subsidiaries. These advertisers and sponsors may independently solicit and collect personal information, or send their own cookies to our visitors. Please be advised that when you visit an advertiser's or sponsor's website you will be subject to the privacy policy and terms of usage agreement of that website operator. Bravo, its parents, partners, affiliates or subsidiaries, will not be responsible for the content, activities, information collection, use and disclosure practices of the websites of advertisers and sponsors.

V. Our Policy on Disclosing Your Information to Parties Other than Bravo

We do not currently sell, rent, exchange or share your personal information with companies other than Bravo unless it is required by law or disclosure is necessary to operate the website and protect the safety of our visitors, employees or property. Bravo is majority-owned by Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Cablevision") and we may in the future share personal information with Cablevision, its affiliates or other entities for other purposes. If we decide to enter into such sharing arrangements, we will disclose in this Privacy Policy the name of the entity(s) that we will share information with, what type of personal information will be shared, how the information will be used, and how to contact us if you do not want us to share your personal information ("opt-out"). We currently conduct joint activities with other Cablevision affiliates; however, we will not share individual visitors' personal information with these entities unless we provide notice in this Privacy Policy.

When visitors send an e-mail to us, we will protect the e-mail address and other personal contact information. However, we may disclose the content of your e-mail to other persons. Please see our [Terms of Usage Agreement](https://web.archive.org/web/20030402130601id_/http%3A//bravotv.com/information/terms.php). We will share your personal information with those persons or companies who provide support for the internal operations of the website and our agents, such as contest fulfillment services, maintenance and technical services, and e-commerce and auction contractors ("contract service and operational providers"). If you are purchasing goods, merchandise or services on this website and use a credit card to complete the transaction, our operational providers may share your personal information and credit card number with a ticket agent, a credit card processing and/or a shipping/fulfillment company in order to complete your order.

We may provide aggregate information about our visitors to our advertisers, sponsors, promotional partners, and affiliates, such as how many persons visited a particular page or activity, the average age of our visitors on site or page, or the likes and dislikes of our visitors, but this information does not include personal information about any individual visitor. We may obtain geographic information such as zip code clustering from other sources, but this aggregate information will not reveal any personal information about a specific visitor.

VI. How To Add, Change, or Delete Personal Information

You will have access to your membership profile collected and maintained by our website. You may add, change or delete personal information on your profile or registration for other activities by contacting us via e-mail on our [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20030402130601id_/http%3A//bravotv.com/information/contact_us.php) web page section. Certain information fields are required and cannot be deleted for security purposes or in accordance with various laws. We encourage you to keep us informed about any changes in your membership information and e-mail address.

VII. Use of Cookies and Tracking Devices

The "cookie" is able to store information such as data about your computer, the type of browser you use, and how many times your computer visits a certain site.

You do not need to have cookies turned on to use most of this site.

VIII. Our Security Procedures

We are committed to safeguarding the privacy of all our visitors. We require our employees to protect the privacy of all information collected over our website. Only employees and supervisors with specific authorization have access to databases containing visitors' personal information. The databases are protected in a secure facility. Credit card information is transmitted via encrypted technology.

If we decide to share visitor information with Cablevision and its affiliates, the receiving entity will also maintain the security and integrity of personal information collected over our website and follow the same privacy practices established in this Privacy Policy.

Please be advised that once you leave our website, your use of the Internet will be governed by the privacy policies and security protections, if any, of the particular website that you are accessing. Bravo is not responsible for the content, activities or privacy practices on the other sites.

IX. Notification of Changes in the Privacy Policy

We will review and modify our security measures and Privacy Policy on a periodic basis, as Bravo deems appropriate. We may also change or update our Privacy Policy if we add new services or features and will prominently post these changes in this policy. We also encourage you to review our Privacy Policy on a regular basis.
