> Privacy Policy
> 
> Introduction   
>  The privacy of those who use this website or app is extremely important to us. We design and operate our technology and services with our users' protection and privacy in mind, and make every effort to be transparent in our data collection and use practices. 
> 
> We comply with the FTC's Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), and support the goals and guidelines set forth by industry self-regulatory bodies and experts such as the Center for Media Education (CME), the Children's Advertising Review Unit (CARU) of the Council of Better Business Bureaus and other organizations devoted to providing online safety and privacy for children, households, parents and schools. We also support daistricts and schools that are subject to compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). 
> 
> This document explains what information we collect about users of this product, how we use this information, who we share the information with and other privacy and security issues. We encourage you to provide us feedback about our privacy policy at privacy@brainpop.com. 
> 
> **A note to minors:** If you are under the age of 13, please get permission from your parent/legal guardian before using this website or app or sending any e-mail to us. You must be 18 or older to order a subscription to any of the BrainPOP® websites or apps. We will not sell or market directly to minors and always seek parental or legal guardian's authorization whenever we identify that a minor attempts to purchase a BrainPOP product or service. 
> 
> **A note to schools and districts:** Wherever we collect student identifiable information, we do so in support of the educational purposes for which BrainPOP is designed. Such information is only collected in conjunction with the use of My BrainPOP™ (our individual accounts system), an optional feature that only schools and districts can opt into. Schools and districts can choose whether to allow their teachers and students the use of this feature. 
> 
>   
>  For purposes of this Policy, we introduce the definitions of how we characterize user's information: 
> 
> " **Personally Identifiable Information** " or " **PII** " is information that can identify a user of this website, including e-mail, name and address. " **Anonymous Information** " is information that does not enable identification of an individual user. " **De-Identified Information** " is information from which all personally identifiable components have been removed. Unlike Anonymous Information, De-Identified information is initially collected as Personally Identifiable Information, after which we remove any identifying component to make the information anonymous. 
> 
>   * Certain activity pages and quizzes allow a user to enter his or her name prior to printing or sending it to an email address entered by the user (such as that of a teacher). We do not collect or store this information. If a user is using a quiz on an app, he or she can enter their name, but we do not collect this information. It is only stored on the user’s device.
>   * Other than in the places and for the purposes explicitly disclosed in this Policy, we do not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information directly from users under the age of 13. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected any Personally Identifiable Information from a user under 13, we will take steps to promptly delete it. Please contact us at privacy@brainpop.com if you believe we have inadvertently collected Personally Identifiable Information from a user under 13.
>   * We do not collect, use or share Personally Identifiable Information other than as described in our privacy policy, or with the consent of a parent or legal guardian as authorized by law, or otherwise as directed by an applicable district or school or required by contract or by law.
>   * In no event shall we use, share or sell any Personally Identifiable Information for advertising or marketing purposes.

> 
> Using My BrainPOP™   
>  Schools or districts using My BrainPOP maintain ownership of their Student Records. 
> 
> Each school or district has access to a user-friendly administrator dashboard that allows direct control over the Student Records at all times. The administrator can create, update, review, modify and delete individual accounts, and monitor logins in the individual accounts. "Administrators" are only those individuals explicitly designated by the school or the district. Schools and districts are required to appoint an administrator that will be responsible for the Student Records, and keep us informed of any changes of such appointment. Districts and schools are urged to safeguard the administrator's access information and keep it in strict confidence, and notify us of any unauthorized use of password or account registered under their subscription. 
> 
> The teachers using My BrainPOP will only be able to access or use My BrainPOP with an Educator Code provided by their school. Students will only be able to access their accounts with a Class Code provided by their teachers. Students will be able to store their activities, quizzes and their correspondences with their teachers on their individual accounts. Students can only interact with teachers who created the My BrainPOP class. Students cannot privately communicate with other students through My BrainPOP. 
> 
> We encourage schools and districts using My BrainPOP to notify parents that the product is used in their school. Parents can log into their children's accounts and access their records. If you are a parent or guardian of a student using My BrainPOP with his or her school, you can request the login information from your child or their teacher. You are encouraged to use the student's login information and view all their activities and progress on the account at any time. Parents have a right to request the student's Personally Identifiable Information be deleted or request changes in his or her records if it is inaccurate or misleading.
> 
>   
>  We understand the obligation educational agencies, districts and school systems have to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and we support schools in their compliance efforts and facilitate their alignment with FERPA. 
> 
> Under the terms of our contracts with schools, we agree to act as a "School Official" as defined by FERPA, meaning that we: 
> 
>   * Perform an institutional service or function for which the school or district would otherwise use its own employees;
>   * Have been determined to meet the criteria set forth in the school's or district's annual notification of FERPA rights for being a School Official with a legitimate educational interest in the education records; 
>   * Are under the direct control of the school or district with regard to the use and maintenance of education records; and 
>   * Use education records only for authorized purposes and will not re-disclose Personally Identifiable Information from education records to other parties (unless we have specific authorization from the school or district to do so and it is otherwise permitted by FERPA).
> 
  
>  Districts and schools are able to delete information at any time and in real time using the Administrator Dashboard as mentioned above. Once information is deleted, we do not retain any copies. Teachers may also choose to archive the classroom they created. My BrainPOP classrooms that have been archived are retained for a period of two years. After such period, all information is automatically disposed and deleted; first it is deleted from the server and two weeks thereafter it is deleted from any backup server and cannot be restored. Districts and schools may request copies of any raw data from the database, which shall be provided within four (4) weeks of the request.
> 
> How We Share Your Information   
>  We may provide Personally Identifiable Information to our partners, business affiliates and third party service providers who work for BrainPOP and operate some of its functionalities, such as hosting services, streaming services and credit card processing. These third parties are well-known, established service providers, who are bound contractually to practice adequate security measures and only use your information for the sole purpose of providing the services. These third parties do not have independent right to share your Personally Identifiable Information. We share Anonymous Information or De-Identified Information about our users for tracking analytical information when using third party web analytical tools. We may use or share Anonymous Information or De-Identified Information for educational research purposes, to evaluate the educational benefit of using our services or to improve our services. 
> 
> **We will NOT share any information for marketing or advertising purposes.**
> 
> We reserve the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information if we are required to do so by law or if we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order or legal process. 
> 
> We also reserve the right to transfer your Personally Identifiable Information in case of a corporate restructuring (such as a merger or acquisition), as long as the receiving entity adopts this privacy policy that applies to your information. 
> 
> How We Store and Process Your Information   
>  We strive to maintain security policies and procedures that are designed to protect your information. 
> 
> Our servers are located in a secured, locked and monitored environment to prevent unauthorized entry or theft, and are protected by a firewall. The servers are located in a data center in the United States and backed up daily to a secure, US based, offsite data center. 
> 
> We take extra measures to ensure the safety of PII and Student Records and apply a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL or HTTPS) encrypting technology to establish and ensure that all data passed between the server and the browser remains encrypted. 
> 
> Governance policies and access controls are in place to ensure that the information of each district or school or other subscriber is separated and they are only able to access their own data. 
> 
> Only limited BrainPOP personnel have access to the database, and they only access the database when necessary to provide services. Personnel with access to Student Records pass criminal background checks. 
> 
> We follow standardized and documented procedures for coding, configuration management, patch installation and change management for all applicable servers and we audit our practices at least once a year. 
> 
> While we strive to maintain best industry-standard privacy and security practices, it should be noted that no industry system is fail proof. In the event we learn of an actual data breach, loss or disaster, we have established a Disaster Recovery Plan, which includes notifying the affected subscriber, and as appropriate, coordinating with the subscriber to support its notification of affected individuals, students and families when there is a substantial risk of harm from the breach or a legal duty to provide notification.
