**Refund Policy**

This policy explains how you handle returns, refunds, and exchanges.  Please display this policy on either the product page or the checkout page of your website.  2Checkout.com makes every effort to refer refund requests to you, the seller, but reserves the right to issue a refund if necessary.

Though “No Refund” Policies are generally permitted, 2Checkout.com strongly recommends against this business practice because it often leads to high customer chargebacks.  Please note there are certain situations where 2Checkout.com cannot permit “No Refund” Policies. If this applies to you, 2Checkout.com will let you know.

If you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, within 120 days from the purchase date, we will fully refund the cost of your order.

_If we decide to change our privacy and refund policy, we will update the Privacy and refundPolicy modification date below._
