### Welcome to the new Branding Magazine!

Just so you know, we’ve upgraded more than our look.

It’s still us in here. Same great contributors. Same four corners of the world. Same element of surprise.

What’s new? We’re sleeker, more focused, and fully dedicated to high-quality thought leadership.

And, for those who already miss our more visual and design-centric content, stay tuned for a new home just for you!
