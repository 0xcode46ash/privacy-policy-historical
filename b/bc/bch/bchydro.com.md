## Registration & Login

In order to use this website, a user may be asked to first complete a registration and/or login form. During registration/login, a user is required to provide contact information (such as a name and email address). This information is used only to contact the user about the services on our site for which he/she has expressed an interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information and unique identifiers, but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

Keep your user ID and password confidential. Be wary of emails that ask for personal information. Never provide your password, personal information numbers or login information via email. We will not ask you for personal information via email except in response to an email you have sent to us. If you receive an unsolicited email asking for personal information please [call customer service](https://web.archive.org/contact/phone.html).

## Order

We request information from the user on our order forms. Here a user must provide contact information (such as name and shipping address) and financial information (such as credit card number and expiration date). This information is used for billing purposes and to fill customers' orders. If we have trouble processing an order, this contact information is used to get in touch with the user. We may use an outside shipping company to ship orders, and a credit card processing company to bill users for goods and services. These companies do not retain, share, store or use personally identifiable information for any secondary purposes.

## Surveys & Contests

From time-to-time our site may have a contest or request information from users via surveys. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and the user therefore has a choice whether or not to disclose any information. Information requested may include contact information, such as name and shipping address, and demographic information. Contact information will be used only to notify the winners and award prizes. Survey information will be used on an aggregated (not individually identifiable) basis only, for purposes of monitoring and/or improving the use and satisfaction of this site.
