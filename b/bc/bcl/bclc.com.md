# Privacy Policy - BCLC

BCLC is committed to respecting your right to privacy. This privacy policy describes the information we collect via the [BCLC website](https://web.archive.org/), how we collect and use that information and how we protect your privacy.

**Collecting Information**  
We do not collect personal information unless our website visitors volunteer it.

When you voluntarily send us electronic mail, we collect your e-mail address and your message so that we may reply to you.

When you submit your response to a survey question(s) or your answers to a contest offered through our website, we learn your answer or any opinions or information that you volunteer.

Your submission to survey questions is used to accumulate survey results that may be published in aggregate (i.e., your submission is not associated with you as an individual).

We may use your response to improve products, services or our website.

Contest entry information is collected, retained and used as described in the contest terms and conditions.

**How We Protect and Use the Information We Collect**  
BCLC's collection, use, retention and disclosure of information complies with the provisions of the B.C. _Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act_. Your information and the business you do with BCLC is kept in strict confidence. Either before or when BCLC collects information about you, we will explain how we intend to use it. We will limit the information we collect to what we need for those purposes and we will use it only for those purposes. We will obtain your consent if we wish to use your information for any other purpose.

We will not sell or trade any personally identifiable information that may be collected from our website and will not disclose such information to third parties except as authorized by law.

**Limiting Employee Access to Information**  
Personal information about you will only be accessible to authorized BCLC employees, agents or representatives who require access to this information in the performance of their duties, or any entities with whom BCLC has contracted to operate and maintain this website who are under an obligation to keep the information confidential.

**Restrictions on Disclosing Information to Other Parties**  
Except as described in this privacy policy, we do not reveal personally identifiable data to parties outside BCLC unless you request or authorize it, or the disclosure is otherwise permitted or required by law.
