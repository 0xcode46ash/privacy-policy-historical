##  Privacy Laws

For information on Australian Privacy laws, see [www.privacy.gov.au](http://www.privacy.gov.au/) 

##  BCL - Web Site Cookies and Statistics

We ask for no personal details from users of Brisbane City Life web pages. Our server registers the following information which is used for general statistical purpose only.

  * Your server or ISP (not your computer)
  * The number of pages visited
  * Versions of browsers used (Netscape, Microsoft IE etc)
  * The country of origin
  * The referring web page (if any) 



We do not track individual readers or check to see when they revisit. Cookies are used within BCL only to monitor the pages used to enter our website and some advertising that appears. You are not identified personally by this information. 

Cookies are used to pass our ID to some of our affiliate links (eg hotels, shopping sites) so that pages will be displayed properly and we can be paid appropriate commissions on sales. We receive click-through figures but do not receive any personal information about the person who followed the link. 

We do not receive the names of people who book hotels or buy from online shops through our site. We receive names only for hostel bookings and some tour bookings but do not use, sell or share them.

  **We ask readers to allow these cookies to be set** as the funding from this advertising makes it possible to provide this service free to readers and supports the free advertising for non-profit and community groups. 

##  BCL  \- Email newsletter

The only information required to receive the BCL email newsletter is a valid email address. We do not sell, share or give our mailing list to any other party. All newsletters include details on how to unsubscribe from the newsletter.   

##  BCL - Tell-a-friend

We do not receive copies of any information sent using our "tell-a-friend" or postcard forms.
