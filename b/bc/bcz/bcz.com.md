# Privacy Policy

**In General**

This BCZ ("BCZ.com") Privacy Policy (our "Policy") was developed as an extension of our commitment to combine the highest-quality products and services with the highest level of integrity in dealing with our valued customers, and the companies, businesses and organizations. The purpose of this statement is to explain the types of information BCZ.com, how the information is obtained, how it is used, and how visitors can restrict its use or disclosure.

IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE POLICY, YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS INTERNET WEBSITE (OUR "SITE"). WE MAY MODIFY THE POLICY FROM TIME TO TIME AND POST THOSE MODIFICATIONS HERE. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AFTER ANY SUCH MODIFICATION CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE MODIFIED AGREEMENT. 

**Information Gathering**

The only information BCZ.com obtains about individual visitors to our website is information supplied voluntarily by the visitor. This means that you can visit our website without telling us who you are or revealing any information about yourself. To gauge the effectiveness of our website, we do collect some non-individually-identifiable generic information about our visitors. Our web servers automatically recognize a visitor's domain name (such as .com, .edu, etc.), the web page from which a visitor enters our site, which pages a visitor visits on our site, and how much time a visitor spends on each page. This information does not reveal a visitor's identity. We aggregate this information and use it to evaluate and improve our websites. 

You can choose to provide individually-identifiable information to BCZ.com in a number of ways through our website - by ordering a service from us, sending us email, providing credit card information or entering a contest. When visitors supply information about themselves for a specific purpose, BCZ.com uses the information for that purpose (such as to provide the information the visitor has requested or to enter a contest). In addition, when visitors use our website to order services, or to request information about our services, we may use the individually-identifiable information as we would use the same information obtained offline - for example, to evaluate your service needs and contact you regarding additional services you may find useful. You have the right to choose not to receive this information by notifying us of your preference.

 **Privacy**

We do not sell or disclose individually-identifiable information obtained online about our visitors, to anyone outside of BCZ.com unless you specifically authorize it, it is required by law, or disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of customers, employees or property. If you provide individually-identifiable information to us in the context of an event BCZ.com sponsors with another company, such as a sweepstakes and contests sponsored by us or one of our partners, or if you register on a co-sponsored site or feature, you may also be providing the individually-identifiable information to the co-sponsor. This will be made clear to you before you submit the information and you can decide whether or not to participate. 

BCZ.com is committed to safeguarding customer privacy. We require our employees to protect the privacy of information about our customers and expect our partners and suppliers to do so as well. You can feel confident that your individually-identifiable information will be protected when you access your account via the online personal control panel/account information page or order services from us over the Internet.
