# BCIT : : Privacy : : Important Privacy Information

## **Possible Unauthorized Access to Personal Information**

**July 5, 2012   **

BCIT respects the privacy of your personal information, which is why, as a precautionary measure, we are reporting a security incident that may have resulted in an unauthorized third party accessing personal information of certain students, staff and faculty.

On June 11, 2012 during a scheduled security audit, the Information Technology Services (ITS) department of BCIT discovered an unauthorized third party had accessed a single computer server associated with the Student Health Services Medical Clinic at the BCIT Burnaby Campus. 

The records stored on this server contained contact information and the basic medical services data of patients who visited the clinic. 

At this time, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no indication that any personal information has been improperly accessed or misused; however BCIT is treating the possibility of unauthorized access to personal information very seriously.

The records on this server date from October, 2005 to June 11, 2012 and include the following personal information that is collected and used for billing purposes: 

  * Name and date of birth
  * Phone number and address
  * Medical Services Plan (MSP) number
  * Personal Health Number (PHN)
  * Treatment billing codes and descriptions 



BCIT president, Don Wright, has sent a letter to individuals who may have been potentially involved in this event informing them of the unauthorized access and we are working with the **[Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia](http://www.oipc.bc.ca/)** to ensure privacy standards are upheld. 

We sincerely regret and apologize for this incident. Please be assured we are taking immediate action to address the situation and will be reviewing our physical, technical, and administrative information security process and following up with recommendations and implementing further preventative measures and safeguards. 

We have conducted an investigation and taken steps to mitigate the risk of personal information being compromised. The server was taken off-line immediately and its hard drives were removed and analyzed.

To date, this analysis indicates the only unauthorized activity that has taken place is the uploading and downloading of movies onto this server.

If you have received a letter from BCIT, or have reason to believe your personal information has been compromised or used inappropriately you should contact:

  * your local police department 
  * the [Medical Services Plan (MSP) ](http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/msp/infoben/contacts.html)of BC. You may also contact MSP by phone at at 1-800-663-7100
  * your health care insurance provider
