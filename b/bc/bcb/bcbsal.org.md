# Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Alabama : Internet Privacy Statement

Because we value your relationship with us, we have detailed below our privacy objectives for our Web site: 

## Security Practices

We recognize and respect your desire for privacy when it comes to your personal and health care affairs. We attempt to protect online information according to established company security standards and practices, and we continually evaluate new technologies for safeguarding information.

## Use of E-Mail

Please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet to an e-mail address. E-mail sent via the Internet may pass through private and public networks with varying levels of security. Some networks may have taken steps to secure e-mail transmissions while others have not, thereby compromising the privacy and integrity of an e-mail. An e-mail may be copied, altered or destroyed.

If you have personal or confidential information to relay to our company, please call the appropriate member service phone number that you will find in [Contact Us](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622080306id_/http%3A//www.bcbsal.org/contact/index.cfm).

We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so that we can efficiently respond to questions you might have. We also do this in an effort to meet legal and regulatory requirements. 

We will respect your request to be, or not to be, contacted by e-mail.

## Surveys and Forms

You may have the opportunity to provide information to us through online surveys and forms. We use this information to better understand health care needs and to provide quality products, services and other opportunities. 

BCBSAL wants your visit to our Web site to be informative and enjoyable. We plan to use any information we obtain from you to help us continually improve the content, functionality and overall usefulness of our Web site; but in no way will make specific and individually identifiable information given to us available without your specific consent.

## Updates to the Statement

Evolving technology will continue to provide us with new and better ways to collect and use information so that we may better serve your health coverage needs. We may revise or update the BCBSAL Privacy Statement in the future to reflect these technological advances, and we encourage you to return to this page from time to time for any updates.

## Confidentiality

Again, please use your own best judgment when sending information via the Internet to an e-mail address. 

If you have personal or confidential information to relay to our company and have concerns about the security of your e-mail, please call the appropriate member service phone number that you will find in [Contact Us ](https://web.archive.org/web/20060622080306id_/http%3A//www.bcbsal.org/contact/index.cfm).
