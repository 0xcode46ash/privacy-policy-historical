In general, you can visit our web pages without telling us who you are or revealing any Personal Information about yourself.

WHAT WE DO WITH YOUR INFORMATION

BCBG Max Azria is able to collect Personal Information from when you use this website. This can be done only when you voluntarily submit such information on our site. For example, when you make a purchase a product from our site, register for a BCBG Max Azria member account, when you subscribe to an email newsletter, when you order our catalogue, when you participate in our surveys and when you register for contests, sweepstakes, and other promotional opportunities provided by BCBG Max Azria, you are supplying us with your Personal Information. We use such information to display content and products that we think may be of interest to you, to personalize your online experience and to improve the quality of the content that we provide to you on the site. From time to time we may share such information with our business partners, who might also wish to offer their products or services to you. Whenever we request that you provide us Personal Information, we will give you the opportunity to "opt out" of receiving future communications from us or others. By providing such Personal Information to BCBG Max Azria, you agree that, unless you expressly opt out of receiving such information, we may use your Personal Information to fulfill the activity you signed up for, such as purchasing a product, notifying sweepstakes winners or sending you our catalogue, and contacting you with updates regarding the site. Whether or not you provide such information is completely your own choice. You are not obligated to answer any question that is presented to you. Please note that if you choose not to provide the Personal Information we request, you may be unable to access certain options, offers, and services that involve our interaction with you. BCBG Max Azria does not intend to transfer Personal Information without your consent. BCBG Max Azria may also disclose your Personal Information when required by law or court order.

If you have provided Personal Information but later you object to the use that is being made of that information (for example, you no longer wish to receive promotional or marketing information about products, services, and offerings from BCBG Max Azria or any third parties) you can ask that we stop making use of that information. You can do this by canceling your BCBG Max Azria member account. Simply send an email message to us at customer.service@bcbg.com and be sure to indicate "UNSUBSCRIBE" in the subject line. Your request will be processed as soon as possible. Please bear in mind that cancellation of your member account will result in you not being able to continue to access the relevant services, offers or content.
