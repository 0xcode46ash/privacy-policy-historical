Personal Information Blue Cross Collects and How It Is Used | Back to Top  
Blue Cross collects information in different ways from users of our site. We use this information to provide a customized experience for you. This information is not shared with third parties. Unless required by law for litigation or special purposes, all information shared with third parties is de-identified. This means that we do not ever share the personal information connected to inquiries, or interactions on our Web site. And, unless you specifically key in personal information on our Web site, you browse our Web site anonymously, which means personal information, such as your e-mail address, is not collected. 

In general, we gather data on the use of our Web site, including domain name, number of hits, pages visited, length of user session, and so forth to evaluate the usefulness of our site.   
  
Protecting Online Interactions | Back to Top  
When you use our online services, you may be asked to provide personal information that is necessary for us to process your request. To ensure your transaction remains confidential, the information is sent to us using an encrypted form in a "secure session" established with Secure Socket Layer (SSL). 

After you have submitted information online, we recommend that you close your browser before leaving your computer. This practice ensures you are not leaving personally identifiable information on the computer for those who may use it after you. This is especially important if you are using a computer in a public place.   
  
How We Handle E-mail | Back to Top  
  
Federal regulations do not allow us to accept or respond to e-mails containing any personal health information. Regular, non-encrypted Internet e-mail is not secure. The e-mail addresses on our Web site are to be used only for non-sensitive and non-confidential inquiries about the site. For private inquiries, please use the other forms of [customer service](https://web.archive.org/contact.shtml) available to you. 

When sharing private information with us, use only Blue Cross-encrypted forms. These forms are clearly labeled throughout the site and inform you of their security level. Because an Internet e-mail response to you is not secure, we will not include confidential member information in any e-mail response.

When our Web site users send e-mail inquiries to Blue Cross, the return e-mail address may be used to respond to the e-mail inquiry. Blue Cross does not use the return e-mail address for any other purpose, nor will we share it with any third parties. We do this to meet legal and regulatory requirements within the health care field. We preserve the content of your e-mail, your e-mail address and our response so that we can more efficiently handle any of your follow-up questions.   
  
What We Do With Voluntary Online Customer Surveys | Back to Top  
  
We periodically conduct two types of surveys on our corporate Web site. General surveys on our site are randomly generated for all users. Specific surveys are offered to Blue Care Network of Michigan members only within the secure Member Self Services area. 

We encourage you to participate in these surveys because they provide us with important information to improve the services we offer. Your personal information and responses remain strictly confidential. Participation in our surveys is voluntary.

All responses to our surveys are aggregated to create summarized results (such as gender, age, or other demographic information). We then use the summarized results to improve the quality of our services to you.   
  
About "Cookies" | Back to Top  
  
To provide better service and a more effective Web site, we make minimal use of temporary "cookies" in the Member Self Service area of our Web site. A "cookie" is a small text file placed on your hard drive by our Web page server. The cookies used by the Blue Cross Web site are temporary and are deleted automatically when you close your browser session. Our cookies provide a more personalized online experience by ensuring that your information is accurate. These cookies do not collect personally identifiable information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to determine who you are or your e-mail address.   
  
About "Banner Ads" | Back to Top  
  
Any site banner ads link you to areas of interest only within our Web site. We do not show banner ads for external Web sites.   
  
Links From Our Site | Back to Top  
  
We have links from our Web site to a number of different health care-related sites. We provide these links as a courtesy to help you find information. We are not responsible for the performance or content of sites linked from [www.bcbsm.com](https://web.archive.org/) since they are beyond our control. We recommend you read the privacy statements on these sites you visit to understand their individual privacy practices.   
  
Protecting Our Children | Back to Top  
  
In compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA), we do not knowingly solicit data from children under 18 years of age, and we do not knowingly market to children under 18 years of age. We recognize that protecting children's identities and privacy online is important and that the responsibility to do so rests with both the online industry and with parents.
