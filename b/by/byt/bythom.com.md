# bythom.com Privacy Policy

I don't currently use cookies or tracking mechanisms on this site (other than general log files, which are only used to collect information on overall site visitation; also PayPal's secure order server tracks partial orders, but that isn't done on my site, but by PayPal). Thus, if you restrict yourself to visiting pages on this site, you leave minimal information behind that could be used to track you (the general logs contain only IP addresses, which for most of you, would require cooperation of your Internet Service Provider in order to isolate to individual user).

However, it sure would help me pay for maintaining and updating the site if you'd purchase my books and other highlighted items through the Amazon links that I've provided (I collect a small extra percentage on such sales). Amazon _does_ use tracking mechanisms, so you need to be aware of them. For example, when you click on an Amazon link on the bythom.com site, an "affiliate ID" is passed with you when you are taken to their URLs. If you make a purchase at either site _**during that session**_ , the affiliate ID is captured with the transaction (so that the site can figure out where to send a commission check). At present, I earn 2% to 5% on Amazon purchases you make this way. Note that the affiliate tracking isn't permanent: if you log off your Internet connection and later log back on and go to Amazon directly, you aren't tracked as a bythom.com referral.

But even that simple act of passing on an affiliate ID has some interesting consequences. Amazon, in particular, has developed technologies that are quite useful, if applied reasonably. You'll note that there's now an "Amazon Recommends" list on my [Other Recommended Books](https://web.archive.org/otherbooks.htm) page. That list is produced by noting what books were purchased by all those who were referred to Amazon by my site. Likewise, as an Amazon affiliate, I can pull up lists of what was purchased bythom.com referrals (as you might guess, The _Nikon Field Guide_ was one of the better sellers, but at least so far in 2001, it appears that the Magic Lantern N80 book is your number one choice on Amazon). I also get reports of the total amount spend by bythom.com referrals (obviously, otherwise I wouldn't know if the commission checks were accurate), though I have no way of knowing who bought what (nor do I want to know). 

Since Amazon collects information about their site visitors, please read their privacy policy when you're on their site if you're concerned about how your surfing might be tracked (see also the links I've provided, below). 

This site also invites you to sign up for my email newsletter on bCentral. If you do, Listbot tracks your email address for me, and you'll receive an email from me from time to time. bCentral is part of Microsoft's services, and does track information on you. While I can get to the basic information about individual email subscribers, to date I have never bothered to look. 

Some of you send me direct email and comments on articles. For legal purposes, I archive all such mail, thus I do maintain a record of what you've sent me. Again, however, it is not my practice to do anything with such information. I don't, for example, add you to the bCentral email server if you send me private email. I don't build email address lists and sell them to others. If a response is warranted, I respond to your email and archive the original. If you've submitted a comment on an article, I edit it and place it on the site if I think it adds useful information or commentry, then archive your original submission (sometimes I'll respond directly if the comment contained a question). In short, I'll respond when you ask for response, otherwise I'll simply archive what you've sent me so that my records regarding this site are complete.

Finally, when you order one of my books through PayPal, you should be aware that PayPal most definitely tracks information about you, both while you're on there secure Web order server, and after you've joined PayPal as a member. PayPal's privacy information is somewhat complicated, so I simply invite you to look at their site for more information (see link, below).
