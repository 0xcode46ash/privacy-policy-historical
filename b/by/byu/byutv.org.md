# BYU Television | Website Privacy Policy

We here at BYU Television would like to thank you for visiting our Web site! We are pleased to have the opportunity to help make the Internet a secure, private, and reliable place to share information. This Privacy Statement explains how we collect and use information from our Web site visitors.

What information is collected?

BYU Television only collects information on a voluntary basis. The personal information BYU Television collects is used almost exclusively for internal purposes and will usually take the form of: (1) byutv.org's comment form submission (usually an email, or mailing address, depending on what the submitter chooses); (2) a pledge submission, or membership submission, supplied by the user (usually mailing and phone information as well as payment information) who wishes to be a pledging member of BYU Television; or (2) other general information contained in an email (e.g., comments). This information is used internally for reports, further contact with the individual (questions on an account, responding to comments or questions, etc.). BYU Television **NEVER** sells or gives this information to third parties. We respect your right to privacy, and will not give this information to anyone outside our organization.

Is the transmission of this information secure?

BYUTV.org employs the use of the latest encryption technology for transmitting information via your internet browser. To ensure that you are able to fully utilize this technology, it is suggested you upgrade your browser to the latest version available. A secured page can be identified by looking at the URL in your address bar. If it says "https://" instead of "http://" you are using a secured page to safely transmit your information to us.

What about cookies?

BYUTV.org uses cookies for statistical purposes only. If you prefer not to accept cookies, disabling cookies will not prevent you from visiting any portion of our site. Cookies are a feature of your Web browser that allow Websites to transfer bits of information to your computer for record-keeping purposes. A cookie stored on your computer can be used to "remember" things like your password, or that you have already registered. BYUTV.org uses cookies for the purpose of storing your preferences for our program guide layout and your preferred time zone, but for no other reason. However, because we do offer hyperlinks to other sites of interest, there is the possibility that one of those Websites may use cookies. Most internet browsers are automatically set to accept cookies. If you are concerned about the placement of cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to alert you when cookies are being sent.

What about internet protocol addresses?

We do log IP addresses for use in our own internal evaluation of the website, to bring users better options, and a better website. An IP address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ("ISP"). IP addresses do not identify you personally. We never share this information with outside sources, and use it only for internal statistical analysis of the traffic on our website.

What about links to other Web sites?

You should be aware that there are links to other Web sites from byutv.org. When you link to other Web sites from us, please be aware that these Web sites are beyond our control. We cannot guarantee that these websites maintain a privacy policy like ours. As always, we recommend that you read the privacy policy of the Web site you are linking to.

What if I have a question or complaint?

If you have any questions, comments, or criticisms regarding this statement or byutv.org's information practices please contact us! You can view our contact information on the [contact page](https://web.archive.org/contact/).
