# Privacy Policy Â« BzzAgent

BzzAgent's Privacy Policy is below in full detail, as written by our legal team.

The short, understandable version is this:

  * BzzAgent will not sell or share your information with any party at any time without your direct approval.
  * By signing up to be a BzzAgent, you are opting-in to receive information about new BzzCampaigns and feedback about your activities from us via e-mail. We won't send you a lot of e-mail, don't worry.
  * If you choose to opt-in to a campaign, you are allowing us to share the results of your actions with our clients. (Just so you know, our clients are interested in the Bzz you create, not your "personal information").
  * You need to be at least 13 years old if you want to register to use this site.



Here's That Long, Legal Version:

### BzzAgent Terms of Service Agreement 

We will closely guard any personally identifiable information you disclose to us during registration or at any other point during your BzzAgent experience. Information will only be shared with a third party if a member requests for that information to be shared, by participating in an offer/program/opt-in/opt-out. A member may request that this information be shared, by opting-in to programs or newsletters that may require information such as, but not be limited to, first name, last name, occupation, e-mail address, mailing address, phone number, selected interests or date of birth. Not all offers/programs/opt-ins/opt-outs specify exactly which pieces of information will be shared. By joining BzzAgent, you are able to opt-in to receive mail from BzzAgent. 

### Information Collection & Use

BzzAgent, Inc. is the sole owner of the information collected on this site, and from its licensed software. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. BzzAgent, Inc. collects information from our users at several different points on our website. BzzAgent, Inc. may share aggregated and anonymous demographic and statistical information with its business partners, but no such information can be linked directly to you or your account. Furthermore, we may need to disclose personally identifiable information when required by law.

### Registration

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration a user is required to give their contact information (such as name, e-mail address, and postal address), additional psychographic information, and information needed for shipping rewards. This information is used to notify the user about new campaigns, specific campaign directives, reward approvals, and changes in point offerings. Users are also required to provide and verify a valid e-mail address before the account creation process can be completed. In addition, we ask a user to provide legitimate proof of address. Proof of address is required in order to guard BzzAgent, Inc. from fraudulent activities. This information is also used for shipping purposes for BzzRewards. If we have trouble processing a BzzReward, this contact information may be utilized to contact a user.

### Account

Once you become a member of BzzAgent, Inc., you will receive a password and an account. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. You agree to immediately notify BzzAgent, Inc. of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security known to the member.

### Our Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data we store for each user session that gives you a unique ID number for that session. We use cookies to allow us to personalize your experience on the BzzAgent website. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you end your session, the cookie simply terminates. We use cookies on our site so that you can move from page to page while staying logged into your account. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, and we will set each link to contain the user's unique id number for your current session.

### Log Files

We do track certain information such as type of browser and log on time for our own use. We use this information only to track where our users may be coming from and what type of software they are using. We keep this information so we can continuously improve our users' online experience and improve the BzzAgent website. None of this information can ever be traced back to any specific person and is useful only to BzzAgent, Inc. 

### Security

We work to protect your information by using Secure Socket Layers (SSL) software to encrypt your information when it is being transmitted to us. Access to data is limited through the use of internal firewalls and strictly enforced. When users submit information via the website, your information is protected both online and off-line. While we use both passwords and usernames to protect information online, we also do everything in our power to protect users' information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that we store personally identifiable information on are kept in a secure environment and professionally maintained. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

### Special Offers & E-mail

We send all new members a welcoming e-mail to verify password and username. Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new campaigns, rewards, and directives from BzzAgent, Inc. if they have opted-in. "Opted-in" means the user has approved certain e-mails to be sent to them from BzzAgent, Inc.

### Site & Service Announcements

Under rare circumstances BzzAgent, Inc. may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the BzzAgent site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or "opt-in/opt-out" of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, BzzAgent, Inc. will post information regarding changes directly on the website. BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information BzzAgent deems relevant.

### Correction/Updating Personal Information

BzzAgent, Inc. users are able to change their personal information at any time. The fastest way to change personal information is to log on and simply click on "My Profile".

### Age/Residency Requirements

Effective April 21, 2000, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) mandated that all websites must be in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). While the BzzAgent site is not directed at children under the age thirteen (13), you must be at least 13 years old, be a United States or Canadian resident, and have a valid e-mail address to enroll in the BzzAgent, Inc. Program ("Program"). Enrollment and participation in the Program is open to individuals only (no corporations or other legal entities). Each individual who enrolls in the Program is responsible for providing this information requested herein and for updating any such information to insure its accuracy. Receipt of inaccurate or misleading information will adversely affect the ability of BzzAgent, Inc. to operate the Program and provide services to clients required by members and participants. In this regard, BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to terminate a member's membership in the Program if misleading or intentionally incorrect personal information is provided. BzzAgent, Inc. reserves the right to modify or discontinue the Program with or without notice to members. BzzAgent, Inc. will not be liable to any member or any third party should BzzAgent, Inc. exercise its right to modify or discontinue the Program.

### Termination

Either the member or BzzAgent, Inc. may terminate the service with or without cause at any time and effective immediately. BzzAgent will not be liable to the member or any third party for termination of service.
