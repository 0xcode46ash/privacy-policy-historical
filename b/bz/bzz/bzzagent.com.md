There are also limited circumstances where we might share information outside of our group, such as where we share your contact details with our clients or fulfilment partners so that they can ship items to you directly or for certain campaigns when you have given us your consent to share your information with our clients so that they can provide you with products, services and advertisements that are more likely to be suited to you.

When you sign up to BzzAgent you are able to opt-in to certain communications from us (e.g. emails about campaigns or special offers) and you can change your account preferences at any time if you change your mind.

We may then ask you to opt-in to certain campaigns. If you opt-in to a campaign, we may share the results of your participation in the campaign with our clients. However, in order to protect your privacy, before sharing we aggregate your campaign results with other members so that your "personal information" is not identifiable to our clients. 

For certain campaigns we may ask for your consent to share your “personal information” with the retailer, merchandise manufacturer or other company identified in the campaign.
