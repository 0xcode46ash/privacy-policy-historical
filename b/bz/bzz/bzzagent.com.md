[](https://privacy-policy.truste.com/click-with-confidence/ctv/en/www.bzzagent.com/seal_m "Validate TRUSTe privacy certification")

BzzAgent takes your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.

This policy describes how we collect, use, share, and protect information about you, as well as the choices you may make about how we use this information.

We are committed to protecting the information you share with us, and we will not use your information in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement without your permission.

This Privacy Policy includes and incorporates the BzzAgent Terms and Conditions of Use.

### What information do we collect?

We collect information about you in various ways, including when you register as a BzzAgent, fill out our surveys, participate in a BzzAgent campaign, and visit our website. When you register as a BzzAgent, complete a survey, or participate in a campaign, we collect the following information from you, in part, to select BzzAgents for campaigns and to notify BzzAgents about new campaigns and specific campaign directives:

  * Name, address, phone number, and e-mail address;
  * Date of birth and gender;
  * Other information about you and your family, including product use preferences and behaviors, occupation, industry, and personal interests;
  * Demographic information; and
  * Contact information for friends you suggest to us to contact (we will only use this information to send the message you request).



When you visit our website or open one of our HTML emails, we may automatically collect information about you using tracking technology, including Internet Protocol address (“IP Address”), a unique device or user ID, system type, the content and pages that you access on the BzzAgent site or the dates and times that you visit the site. BzzAgent may use cookies and similar technology (as described below) to collect information for the purpose of customizing the content you receive. 

We also may collect information from third party websites with whom we connect. As an example, if you connect to our site via Facebook, Facebook provides us with certain information from your Facebook account, which may include, without limitation, your Facebook User ID, the amount of activity (i.e., comments, likes) that may occur in response to posts, certain demographic information and other information to the extent that you elect to make it publicly available on Facebook.

The information we collect from third party websites will be used to continue to allow you to connect to such third party sites while on our site and to show our clients the volume of activity around their marketing campaign.

We may also obtain information about you from other sources, including affiliates, data aggregators, and public databases. All of the information we collect may be combined to create a more detailed picture of you, which allows us to better understand the products and services you might be interested in.

### How do we use this information? Will we share this information with outside parties?

BzzAgent may use and share the information we collect about you:

  * To register you as a BzzAgent, enroll you in campaigns or other programs at your request, communicate with you about campaigns, and to send samples and products to you.
  * To communicate with our clients about the results of the campaigns in which you participate and help clients develop advertising tailored to your interests.
  * To analyze the use of our products and services.
  * With our trusted partners (affiliates, clients or other third parties) who work on behalf of or with BzzAgent : (1) to help BzzAgent communicate with you about offers from BzzAgent and our marketing partners; (2) to help BzzAgent customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients; and (3) to help BzzAgent provide our services (for example, order fulfillment, statistical analyses, list analysis, data processing and to comply with unsubscribed lists).
  * With our subsidiaries and affiliates some of whom help us provide the services mentioned above. For example BzzAgent works with dunnhumby, an affiliate, to customize the advertising and content you see, fulfill your requests for products and services, improve our services, conduct research, and provide anonymous reporting for internal and external clients. We also may share your information with any company who may purchase BzzAgent or substantially all of our assets in the future.
  * To enforce the incorporated Terms and Conditions of use, to comply with legal obligations, and otherwise manage our business.



BzzAgent will only use and share your information as described in this policy.

BzzAgent may also share aggregated information that cannot be used to identify you with our clients and business partners.

A cookie is a piece of data that is placed on your computer when you visit a website. We use cookies to personalize your experience on the BzzAgent website and monitor how our site is used. Usage of a cookie is not linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once you end your session, the cookie simply terminates unless otherwise designated by you. We use cookies on our site so that you can move from page to page while staying logged into your account. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site, and we will set each link to contain the user's unique id number for your current session. You can set your browser to accept or reject cookies and to disable other tracking technology.

#### Third Party Cookies

Our privacy statement does not cover the use of cookies by others including our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company and service providers. We do not have access or control over these cookies. 

#### Log Files

We do track certain information such as type of browser and log on time for our own use. We use this information only to track where our users may be coming from and what type of software they are using. We keep this information so we can continuously improve our users' online experience and improve the BzzAgent website. None of this information can be traced back to any specific person.

### Data Security, Storage, & Transfers 

#### Security

We work to protect your information. We have appropriate technical, administrative and physical procedures in place to protect personal information from loss, misuse, or alteration. For example, we use Secure Socket Layers (SSL) software to encrypt your information when it is being transmitted to us. Access to data is limited through the use of internal firewalls and strictly enforced. While we use both passwords and usernames to protect information online, we also protect users' information off-line. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job are granted access to personal information. When we share your information with third party service providers as described above, we only provide those third parties with the information necessary to perform their service and we require that they protect your information and not use it for any other purpose. You are solely responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your passwords and/or any account information. Please be careful and responsible whenever you're online.

### Special Offers & E-mail

We send new members a welcoming e-mail to verify their username. Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new campaigns, updates, and directives from BzzAgent if they have opted-in. "Opted-in" means the user has approved certain e-mails to be sent to them from BzzAgent

### Other Sites

Our website may include links to websites operated by other companies. We may also run campaigns or provide offers from other companies. BzzAgent is not responsible for the privacy practices of websites or other services operated by third parties that are linked to or integrated with our services or for the privacy practices of any third party. Once you leave our website via such a link, access a third party application (such as widgets) or click on a third party offer, you should check the applicable privacy policy of the third party or advertiser site to determine, among other things, how they will handle any personal information they collect from you.

### Communication from Bzz

Under rare circumstances BzzAgent may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an important announcement about the BzzAgent site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or "opt-in/opt-out" of these announcements because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts. Before these measures are taken, however, BzzAgent will post information regarding changes directly on the website. BzzAgent reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important information BzzAgent deems relevant.

If you opt-in to receiving communications by mobile messaging or e-mail, you may stop receiving promotional messages by message or e-mail by following the unsubscribe instructions contained in the message.

Receipt of inaccurate or misleading information will adversely affect the ability of BzzAgent to effectively run the campaigns and provide services to BzzAgents and its clients. In this regard, BzzAgent reserves the right to terminate a BzzAgent if misleading or intentionally incorrect personally identifiable information is provided.

### Changes in this Privacy Statement 

We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post the changes to the privacy statement here and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If we make material changes to this policy, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on our home page.
