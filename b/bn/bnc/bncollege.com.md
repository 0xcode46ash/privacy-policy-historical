## Privacy Policy

**SECURE SITE**

  The security of the information regarding your order is very important to us. We use the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol to protect the security of your on-line order information. SSL technology encrypts your order information to protect it from being decoded by anyone other than Barnes & Noble College. Once you enter the checkout page your computer will begin communicating with our server in secure mode. You can tell that you are in secure mode by the following:

  * The “http” in the web address will be replaced by “https”, indicating that you’ve reached a secure area of the website.
  * Depending on the browser, you will see either a padlock (Microsoft Internet Explorer, AOL, Netscape Communicator) or a solid key (Netscape Navigator) in the lower section of the browser window.
  * Only browsers that use the Secure Socket Layer protocol are able to order through the Bookstore website. If your browser does not support SSL, you can get an upgrade at Microsoft’s or Netscape’s home page.
